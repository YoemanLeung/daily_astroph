## Feb 4:

#### [Observational constraints on the physical nature of submillimetre source multiplicity: chance projections are common](https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.00452)
    *  We performed spectroscopy of 11 SMGs in six multi-component submm
sources
    * We conclude that physically associated systems and chance projections both contribute to the multi-component single-dish submm source population.


#### [Mapping UV Properties Throughout the Cosmic Horseshoe: Lessons from VLT-MUSE](https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.00455)
    * System is made up of four star-forming regions
    * Absorption line velocities reveal a range of outflow strengths,
    * while it is possible to trace variations in large scale gas kinematics, detecting inhomogeneities in physical gas properties and their effects on the outflowing gas may be more difficult.


#### [Resolving the Disc-Halo Degeneracy I: A Look at NGC 628](https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.00465)
    * disk的scale hight测量用的是NIR，所以是老年星族，但是dispersion是所有年龄恒星的
    * 通过PNe作为动力学tracer，分成老年和年轻成分
    * 如果不考虑年轻disk，盘的质量面密度会被低估


#### [MALS-NOT: Identifying Radio-Bright Quasars for the MeerKAT Absorption Line Survey](https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.00482)

    * The green galaxies at z < 2 show the highest AGN fraction, suggesting that AGN feedback may have played an important role in star formation quenching.
    * A significant environmental difference is found between green and red galaxies at z < 1.5. Green and blue galaxies at z > 0.5 seem to have similar local density distributions, suggesting that environment quenching is not the major mechanism to cease star formation at z > 0.5.
    * 基本没有新结论


#### [Correlations of the feedback energy and BCG radio luminosity in galaxy clusters](https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.00454)
    * 22 BCGs using GMRT: We find moderate to strong correlation of the brightest cluster galaxy (BCG) radio luminosity (LR) with the feedback energy and various other cluster thermal properties.
    * active galactic nucleus (AGN) is more efficient in transferring feedback energy to the ICM in less massive clusters.
    * Extended GMRT Radio Halo Survey (EGRHS) (Kale et al. 2015)


#### [Unveiling Galaxy Bias via the Halo Model, KiDS and GAMA](https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.00734)
    * We use the concept of non-linear and stochastic galaxy biasing in the framework of halo occupation statistics to constrain the parameters of the halo occupation statistics
    * stochasticity mostly originating from the non-Poissonian behaviour of satellite galaxies in the dark matter haloes and their spatial distribution, which does not follow the spatial distribution of dark matter in the halo.
    * The observed non-linearity is mostly due to the presence of the central galaxies

## Feb 5:

#### [Globular cluster populations and the kinematical fingerprints of minor mergers](https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.00812)
    - **Relevant**
    * in contrast with the accreted stellar halo, the accretion events contributing to the assembly of the halo populations of red and blue GCs are increasingly biased towards low satellite-to-host virial mass ratios.
    * our cosmologically accreted blue GC populations are systematically more extended and have higher velocity dispersions than for red GCs


#### [Multidimensional Data Driven Classification of Active Galaxies](https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.01233)
    * 基于4个发射线流量比的多高斯分布分类模型

#### [Classifying and modelling spiral structures in hydrodynamic simulations of astrophysical      discs](https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.01364)
    * used tensor classification to identify regions that were “spiral-like”, we can now obtain fits to spirals for individual arm elements.
    * Our methods not only permit the estimation of pitch angles, but also direct measurements of the spiral arm width and pattern speed.

#### [Exploring the making of a galactic wind in the star-bursting dwarf irregular galaxy IC 10 with LOFAR](https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.01463)
    * We find that IC 10 has a low-frequency radio halo, which manifests itself as a second component (thick disc) in the minor axis profiles of the non-thermal radio continuum emission at 140 and 1580 MHz.
    * 1D cosmic-ray transport models for pure diffusion and advection.
    * cosmic rays can play a vital role for the launching of galactic winds in the disc–halo interface.

    * 40 AGNs in dwarf galaxies: Type 2 AGN with 1E4-1E5 Msun BH.
    * AGN fraction at dwarf end is low and decreases with stellar mass.
    * AGN fraction in dwarf is lower at high-z: different with massive galaxies.


#### [ProFound: Source Extraction and Application to Modern Survey Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.00937)
    - **Useful, Important**
    * ProFound + ProFit处理星系图像

## Feb 7:

#### [LeMMINGs. I. The eMERLIN legacy survey of nearby galaxies. 1.5-GHz parsec-scale radio structures and cores](https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.02162)
    * high-resolution (0.2 arcsec) 1.5-GHz radio images of 103 nearby galaxies from the Palomar sample
    * Half of the sample shows jetted morphologies. The remaining half shows single radio cores or complex morphologies.
    * Radio core luminosities correlate with black hole (BH) mass down to ∼10^7 M⊙, but a break emerges at lower masses.
    * In conclusion, LINER nuclei are the scaled-down version of FR I radio galaxies; Seyferts show less collimated jets


#### [Galaxy pairs in the SDSS - XIII. The connection between enhanced star formation and molecular gas properties in galaxy mergers](https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.02166)
    * We find that the galaxy pairs have shorter depletion times and an average molecular gas fraction enhancement of 0.4 dex compared to the mass matched control sample drawn from xCOLDGASS.
    * the gas masses (and fractions) in galaxy pairs and their depletion times are consistent with those of non-mergers whose SFRs are similarly elevated.


#### [The New Numerical Galaxy Catalogue (ν^2 GC): Properties of Active Galactic Nuclei and Their Host Galaxies](https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.02169)
    * 如果假定吸积率指数下降，以及吸积时标和halo或者bulge的动力学时标相当，z<1.5的AGN比例会被低估
    * accretion timescale of such less luminous AGNs instead should be a function of the black hole mass and the accreted gas mass.
    * Such models predict a longer accretion timescale for less luminous AGNs at z < 1.0 than bright QSOs


#### [Physical and numerical stability and instability of AGN bubbles in a hot intracluster medium](https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.02177)
    * Compare four hydrodynamical schemes in idealized simulations of a rising bubble inflated by AGN feedback in a hot stratified ICM: (traditional) smoothed particle hydrodynamics (TSPH), a pressure flavour of SPH (PSPH), a meshless finite mass (MFM) scheme, as well as an Eulerian code with adaptive mesh refinement.


#### [Spectrophotometric Redshifts In The Faint Infrared Grism Survey: Finding Overdensities Of Faint Galaxies](https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.02239)
    * With the more-accurate spectrophotometric redshifts (SPZs), we searched the FIGS fields for galaxy over- densities. We identified 24 overdensities across the 4 fields.


#### [LBT/MODS spectroscopy of globular clusters in the irregular galaxy NGC 4449](https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.02338)
    - **Interesting**
    * The inferred cluster ages are typically older than ∼9 Gyr, although ages are derived with large uncertainties. The clusters exhibit intermediate metallicities, in the range −1.2 [Fe/H]  −0.7, and typically sub-solar [α/F e] ratios, with a peak at ∼ −0.4.
    * The majority of clusters appear also under-abundant in CN compared to Milky Way halo globular clusters, perhaps because of the lack of a conspicuous N-enriched, second-generation of stars like that observed in Galactic globular clusters.


#### [xGASS: Total cold gas scaling relations and molecular-to-atomic gas ratios of galaxies in the local Universe](https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.02373)
    * a gas fraction-limited census of the atomic hydrogen (Hi) gas content of 1179 galaxies selected only by stellar mass
    * We find that atomic gas fractions keep increasing with decreasing stellar mass, with no sign of a plateau down to log M⋆/M⊙ = 9.
    * Total gas reservoirs remain Hi-dominated across our full stellar mass range, hence total gas fraction scaling relations closely resemble atomic ones
    * variations of Rmol are mostly driven by changes of the Hi reservoirs, with a clear dependence on μ⋆
