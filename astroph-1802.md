## Feb 4:

#### [Observational constraints on the physical nature of submillimetre source multiplicity: chance projections are common](https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.00452)
    *  We performed spectroscopy of 11 SMGs in six multi-component submm
sources
    * We conclude that physically associated systems and chance projections both contribute to the multi-component single-dish submm source population.


#### [Mapping UV Properties Throughout the Cosmic Horseshoe: Lessons from VLT-MUSE](https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.00455)
    * System is made up of four star-forming regions
    * Absorption line velocities reveal a range of outflow strengths,
    * while it is possible to trace variations in large scale gas kinematics, detecting inhomogeneities in physical gas properties and their effects on the outflowing gas may be more difficult.


#### [Resolving the Disc-Halo Degeneracy I: A Look at NGC 628](https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.00465)
    * disk的scale hight测量用的是NIR，所以是老年星族，但是dispersion是所有年龄恒星的
    * 通过PNe作为动力学tracer，分成老年和年轻成分
    * 如果不考虑年轻disk，盘的质量面密度会被低估


#### [MALS-NOT: Identifying Radio-Bright Quasars for the MeerKAT Absorption Line Survey](https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.00482)
    * 1.4GHz + WISE color 选z>1.5的类星体做MeerKAT L-band观测


#### [The morphological evolution, AGN fractions, dust content, environments, and downsizing of massive green valley galaxies at 0.5<z<2.5 in 3D-HST/CANDELS](h ttps://arxiv.org/abs/1802.00550)
    * The green galaxies at z < 2 show the highest AGN fraction, suggesting that AGN feedback may have played an important role in star formation quenching.
    * A significant environmental difference is found between green and red galaxies at z < 1.5. Green and blue galaxies at z > 0.5 seem to have similar local density distributions, suggesting that environment quenching is not the major mechanism to cease star formation at z > 0.5.
    * 基本没有新结论


#### [Correlations of the feedback energy and BCG radio luminosity in galaxy clusters](https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.00454)
    * 22 BCGs using GMRT: We find moderate to strong correlation of the brightest cluster galaxy (BCG) radio luminosity (LR) with the feedback energy and various other cluster thermal properties.
    * active galactic nucleus (AGN) is more efficient in transferring feedback energy to the ICM in less massive clusters.
    * Extended GMRT Radio Halo Survey (EGRHS) (Kale et al. 2015)


#### [Unveiling Galaxy Bias via the Halo Model, KiDS and GAMA](https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.00734)
    * We use the concept of non-linear and stochastic galaxy biasing in the framework of halo occupation statistics to constrain the parameters of the halo occupation statistics
    * stochasticity mostly originating from the non-Poissonian behaviour of satellite galaxies in the dark matter haloes and their spatial distribution, which does not follow the spatial distribution of dark matter in the halo.
    * The observed non-linearity is mostly due to the presence of the central galaxies

## Feb 5:

#### [Globular cluster populations and the kinematical fingerprints of minor mergers](https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.00812)
    - **Relevant**
    * in contrast with the accreted stellar halo, the accretion events contributing to the assembly of the halo populations of red and blue GCs are increasingly biased towards low satellite-to-host virial mass ratios.
    * our cosmologically accreted blue GC populations are systematically more extended and have higher velocity dispersions than for red GCs


#### [Multidimensional Data Driven Classification of Active Galaxies](https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.01233)
    * 基于4个发射线流量比的多高斯分布分类模型
    * We also introduce linear multi-dimensional decision surfaces using support vector machines based on the classification of our soft clustering scheme


#### [Classifying and modelling spiral structures in hydrodynamic simulations of astrophysical      discs](https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.01364)
    * used tensor classification to identify regions that were “spiral-like”, we can now obtain fits to spirals for individual arm elements.
    * Our methods not only permit the estimation of pitch angles, but also direct measurements of the spiral arm width and pattern speed.

#### [Exploring the making of a galactic wind in the star-bursting dwarf irregular galaxy IC 10 with LOFAR](https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.01463)
    * We find that IC 10 has a low-frequency radio halo, which manifests itself as a second component (thick disc) in the minor axis profiles of the non-thermal radio continuum emission at 140 and 1580 MHz.
    * 1D cosmic-ray transport models for pure diffusion and advection.
    * cosmic rays can play a vital role for the launching of galactic winds in the disc–halo interface.


#### [Characterising bars in low surface brightness galaxies](https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.01479)
    * Bar length：和高面亮度星系类似，Bar strength: 偏低


#### [Intermediate-mass black holes in dwarf galaxies out to redshift ∼ 2.4 in the Chandra COSMOS Legacy Survey](https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.01567)
    * 40 AGNs in dwarf galaxies: Type 2 AGN with 1E4-1E5 Msun BH.
    * AGN fraction at dwarf end is low and decreases with stellar mass.
    * AGN fraction in dwarf is lower at high-z: different with massive galaxies.    


#### [ProFound: Source Extraction and Application to Modern Survey Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.00937)
    - **Useful, Important**
    * ProFound + ProFit处理星系图像
    * All photometry is executed on dilated segmentation maps that fully contain the identifiable flux, rather than using more traditional circular or ellipse based photometry
    * EBImage watershed function used in ProFound (Gregoire et al. 2010)
