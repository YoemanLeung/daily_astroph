## Feb 4:

#### [Observational constraints on the physical nature of submillimetre source multiplicity: chance projections are common](https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.00452)
    *  We performed spectroscopy of 11 SMGs in six multi-component submm
sources
    * We conclude that physically associated systems and chance projections both contribute to the multi-component single-dish submm source population.


#### [Mapping UV Properties Throughout the Cosmic Horseshoe: Lessons from VLT-MUSE](https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.00455)
    * System is made up of four star-forming regions
    * Absorption line velocities reveal a range of outflow strengths,
    * while it is possible to trace variations in large scale gas kinematics, detecting inhomogeneities in physical gas properties and their effects on the outflowing gas may be more difficult.


#### [Resolving the Disc-Halo Degeneracy I: A Look at NGC 628](https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.00465)
    * disk的scale hight测量用的是NIR，所以是老年星族，但是dispersion是所有年龄恒星的

    * The green galaxies at z < 2 show the highest AGN fraction, suggesting that AGN feedback may have played an important role in star formation quenching.
    * A significant environmental difference is found between green and red galaxies at z < 1.5. Green and blue galaxies at z > 0.5 seem to have similar local density distributions, suggesting that environment quenching is not the major mechanism to cease star formation at z > 0.5.

#### [Correlations of the feedback energy and BCG radio luminosity in galaxy clusters](https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.00454)
    * 22 BCGs using GMRT: We find moderate to strong correlation of the brightest cluster galaxy (BCG) radio luminosity (LR) with the feedback energy and various other cluster thermal properties.
    * active galactic nucleus (AGN) is more efficient in transferring feedback energy to the ICM in less massive clusters.
    * Extended GMRT Radio Halo Survey (EGRHS) (Kale et al. 2015)


#### [Unveiling Galaxy Bias via the Halo Model, KiDS and GAMA](https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.00734)
    * We use the concept of non-linear and stochastic galaxy biasing in the framework of halo occupation statistics to constrain the parameters of the halo occupation statistics
    * stochasticity mostly originating from the non-Poissonian behaviour of satellite galaxies in the dark matter haloes and their spatial distribution, which does not follow the spatial distribution of dark matter in the halo.
    * The observed non-linearity is mostly due to the presence of the central galaxies

## Feb 5:

#### [Globular cluster populations and the kinematical fingerprints of minor mergers](https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.00812)
    - **Relevant**
    * in contrast with the accreted stellar halo, the accretion events contributing to the assembly of the halo populations of red and blue GCs are increasingly biased towards low satellite-to-host virial mass ratios.
    * our cosmologically accreted blue GC populations are systematically more extended and have higher velocity dispersions than for red GCs


#### [Multidimensional Data Driven Classification of Active Galaxies](https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.01233)
    * 基于4个发射线流量比的多高斯分布分类模型

#### [Classifying and modelling spiral structures in hydrodynamic simulations of astrophysical      discs](https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.01364)
    * used tensor classification to identify regions that were “spiral-like”, we can now obtain fits to spirals for individual arm elements.
    * Our methods not only permit the estimation of pitch angles, but also direct measurements of the spiral arm width and pattern speed.
    * https://github.com/dh4gan/tache


#### [Exploring the making of a galactic wind in the star-bursting dwarf irregular galaxy IC 10 with LOFAR](https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.01463)
    * We find that IC 10 has a low-frequency radio halo, which manifests itself as a second component (thick disc) in the minor axis profiles of the non-thermal radio continuum emission at 140 and 1580 MHz.
    * 1D cosmic-ray transport models for pure diffusion and advection.
    * cosmic rays can play a vital role for the launching of galactic winds in the disc–halo interface.

    * 40 AGNs in dwarf galaxies: Type 2 AGN with 1E4-1E5 Msun BH.
    * AGN fraction at dwarf end is low and decreases with stellar mass.
    * AGN fraction in dwarf is lower at high-z: different with massive galaxies.


#### [ProFound: Source Extraction and Application to Modern Survey Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.00937)
    - **Useful, Important**

## Feb 7:

#### [LeMMINGs. I. The eMERLIN legacy survey of nearby galaxies. 1.5-GHz parsec-scale radio structures and cores](https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.02162)
    * high-resolution (0.2 arcsec) 1.5-GHz radio images of 103 nearby galaxies from the Palomar sample
    * Half of the sample shows jetted morphologies. The remaining half shows single radio cores or complex morphologies.
    * Radio core luminosities correlate with black hole (BH) mass down to ∼10^7 M⊙, but a break emerges at lower masses.
    * In conclusion, LINER nuclei are the scaled-down version of FR I radio galaxies; Seyferts show less collimated jets


#### [Galaxy pairs in the SDSS - XIII. The connection between enhanced star formation and molecular gas properties in galaxy mergers](https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.02166)
    * We find that the galaxy pairs have shorter depletion times and an average molecular gas fraction enhancement of 0.4 dex compared to the mass matched control sample drawn from xCOLDGASS.
    * the gas masses (and fractions) in galaxy pairs and their depletion times are consistent with those of non-mergers whose SFRs are similarly elevated.


#### [The New Numerical Galaxy Catalogue (ν^2 GC): Properties of Active Galactic Nuclei and Their Host Galaxies](https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.02169)
    * 如果假定吸积率指数下降，以及吸积时标和halo或者bulge的动力学时标相当，z<1.5的AGN比例会被低估
    * accretion timescale of such less luminous AGNs instead should be a function of the black hole mass and the accreted gas mass.
    * Such models predict a longer accretion timescale for less luminous AGNs at z < 1.0 than bright QSOs


#### [Physical and numerical stability and instability of AGN bubbles in a hot intracluster medium](https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.02177)
    * Compare four hydrodynamical schemes in idealized simulations of a rising bubble inflated by AGN feedback in a hot stratified ICM: (traditional) smoothed particle hydrodynamics (TSPH), a pressure flavour of SPH (PSPH), a meshless finite mass (MFM) scheme, as well as an Eulerian code with adaptive mesh refinement.


#### [Spectrophotometric Redshifts In The Faint Infrared Grism Survey: Finding Overdensities Of Faint Galaxies](https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.02239)
    * With the more-accurate spectrophotometric redshifts (SPZs), we searched the FIGS fields for galaxy over- densities. We identified 24 overdensities across the 4 fields.


#### [LBT/MODS spectroscopy of globular clusters in the irregular galaxy NGC 4449](https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.02338)
    - **Interesting**
    * The inferred cluster ages are typically older than ∼9 Gyr, although ages are derived with large uncertainties. The clusters exhibit intermediate metallicities, in the range −1.2 [Fe/H]  −0.7, and typically sub-solar [α/F e] ratios, with a peak at ∼ −0.4.
    * The majority of clusters appear also under-abundant in CN compared to Milky Way halo globular clusters, perhaps because of the lack of a conspicuous N-enriched, second-generation of stars like that observed in Galactic globular clusters.


#### [xGASS: Total cold gas scaling relations and molecular-to-atomic gas ratios of galaxies in the local Universe](https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.02373)
    * a gas fraction-limited census of the atomic hydrogen (Hi) gas content of 1179 galaxies selected only by stellar mass
    * We find that atomic gas fractions keep increasing with decreasing stellar mass, with no sign of a plateau down to log M⋆/M⊙ = 9.
    * Total gas reservoirs remain Hi-dominated across our full stellar mass range, hence total gas fraction scaling relations closely resemble atomic ones
    * variations of Rmol are mostly driven by changes of the Hi reservoirs, with a clear dependence on μ⋆

    * We find that this result is robust against the set of isochrones used in the stellar population models, as well as the way the effect of elemental abundance ratios is taken into account.
    * For the first time, we show that there is no dependence of Γb on environment or galaxy hierarchy, as measured within the 3′′ SDSS fibre, thus leaving the IMF as an intrinsic galaxy property, possibly set already at high redshift.

    * We find the average total density slope of EAGLE lenses, t = 2.26 (0.25 rms) to be higher than SL2S, t = 2.16 or SLACS, t = 2.08.
    * We find a very strong correlation between the external shear (γ) and the complex ellipticity (ε), with γ ∼ ε/4.
