* [Evident black hole-bulge coevolution in the distant universe](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.00003)
  * We have studied sample-averaged SMBH accretion rate (BHAR) for bulge-dominated galaxies at z = 0.5–3. 发现吸积率和SFR的关系更好
  * 但是在其他非bulge-dominated的样本里，黑洞吸积率还是和质量的关系更好，而没有明显的SFR相关
  * SMBH主要是和bulge共同演化: Our results reveal that SMBH and bulge growth are in lockstep, and thus non-causal scenarios of merger averaging are unlikely the origin of the MBH-Mbulge correlation.

* [The Column Density, Kinematics, and Thermal State of Metal-Bearing Gas within the Virial Radius of z~2 Star-Forming Galaxies in the Keck Baryonic Structure Survey](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.00003)
  * Keck Baryonic Structure Survey (KBSS): 红移2的L_star星系的130个有金属丰度测量的吸收气体结构
  * we infer that halo gas is kinematically complex when viewed in singly, doubly, and triply ionized species.
  * 高电离宽吸收线OVI和CIV的速度和低电离线类似，但是线结构不同，说明CGM是多Phase的
  * 100 kpc以内的气体覆盖比例很高，即便对OVI这种高电离气体也是
  * Observations of a single galaxy probed by a lensed background QSO suggest the size of metal-bearing clouds is small
  * 高速的气体外流比较常见：The gas kinematics unambiguously show that 70% of galaxies with detected metal absorption have some unbound metal-enriched gas, suggesting galactic winds may commonly eject gas from halos at z∼2.

* [Spectroscopic QUasar Extractor and redshift (z) EstimatorSQUEzE I: Methodology](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.00023)
  * SQUEzE, a software package to classify quasar spectra and estimate their redshifts

* [Host galaxies of merging compact objects: mass, star formation rate, metallicity and colours](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.00083)
  * By combining the results of MOBSE population-synthesis models together with galaxy catalogs from the EAGLE simulation, We predict that the stellar mass of the host galaxy is an excellent tracer of the merger rate per galaxy nGW of double neutron stars (DNSs), double black holes (DBHs) and black hole-neutron star binaries (BHNSs).
  * 并合率和SFR关系很好, 因此与颜色也有相关
  * Interestingly, ≳60 %, ≳64 % and ≳73 % of all the DNSs, BHNSs and DBHs merging in the local Universe lie in early-type galaxies
    * The population synthesis code mobse (Giacobbo et al. 2018) represents an upgrade of the bse code (Hurley et al. 2000, 2002) including new prescriptions for stellar winds (see Vink et al. 2001; Vink & de Koter 2005; Chen et al. 2015), core collapse supernovae (SNe) based on Fryer et al. (2012), and pair-instability and pulsational pair-instability SNe (Woosley 2017; Spera & Mapelli 2017).

* [Circumgalactic Pressure Profiles Indicate Precipitation-Limited Atmospheres for M_* ~ 10^9 - 10^11.5 M_Sun](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.00084)
  * **Interesting**
  * Using photoionization modelling of absorption lines along the QSO LOS to determine cloud pressures, we find that galaxies are surrounded by extended atmospheres that confine the clouds and have a radial pressure profile that depends on galaxy mass.
  * we compare those pressure measurements with models predicting the critical pressure at which cooler clouds start to precipitate (沉淀) out of the hot atmosphere and rain toward the center. We find excellent agreement

* [The distance, supernova rate and supernova progenitors of NGC 6946](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.00173)
  * Here we use the high supernova rate of the galaxy to derive the star-formation rate and predict the galaxy's FUV flux. We also account for dust extinction by different methods to derive a distance of 7.9+/-4.0 Mpc for NGC 6946.
  * 距离可以影响其中超新星progenitors的性质的研究，让看上去奇特的超新星变得正常

* [CO, H2O, H2O+ line and dust emission in a z = 3.63 strongly lensed starburst merger at sub-kiloparsec scales](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.00273)
  * ALMA超高分辨观测一个z=3.6的超级明亮的被透镜放大的星系，有CO和H2O的探测
  * The dust continuum and molecular gas emission are resolved into a nearly complete ~1"5 diameter Einstein ring plus a weaker image in the center
  * The reconstructed dust emission in the source plane is dominated by a compact disk with an effective radius of 0.7kpc plus an overlapping extended disk with a radius twice as large. While the average magnification for the dust continuum is μ~10-11, the magnification of the line emission varies 5 to 22 across different velocity components.

* [Fornax globular cluster distributions: implications for the cusp-core problem](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.00354)
  * 细致的模拟研究：We test two alternative hypotheses, which are a cored and a cuspy halo for Fornax by exploring a reasonable range of initial conditions on globular clusters. For Fornax cored dark matter halo, we derive a lower limit on the core size of rc >0.5 kpc.
  * Contrary to many previous works, we show also that for different initial conditions, a cuspy halo is not ruled out in our simulations based on observations of Fornax globular clusters.

* [Optical IFU spectroscopy of a bipolar microquasar jet in NGC 300](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.00005)
  * The discovery of a candidate jet-driving microquasar (S10) in the nearby spiral galaxy NGC 300
  * We present optical MUSE integral field unit (IFU) observations of S10, which reveal a bipolar line-emitting jet structure surrounding a continuum-emitting central source.

* [A New Class of X-Ray Tails of Early-Type Galaxies and Subclusters in Galaxy Clusters - Slingshot Tails vs Ram Pressure Stripped Tails](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.00482)

* [The MUSE Ultra Deep Field (MUDF). I. Discovery of a group of Lyα nebulae associated with a bright z≈3.23 quasar pair](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.00483)

* [The host galaxy of GRB 980425 / SN1998bw: a collisional ring galaxy](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.00485)
  * This is a very clear case of interaction in a gamma ray burst host galaxy, and of interaction-driven star formation giving rise to a gamma ray burst in a dense environment.

* [Lens Model and Source Reconstruction Reveal the Morphology and Star Formation Distribution in the Cool Spiral LIRG SGAS J143845.1+145407](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.00532)

* [The Global Star-Formation Law by Supernova Feedback](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.00962)
  * A simple model where the Kennicutt-Schmidt (KS) relation between the macroscopic densities of star-formation rate (SFR, ρsfr) and gas (n) in galactic discs emerges from self-regulation of the SFR via supernova feedback
  * The key is that the filling factor of SFR-suppressed supernova bubbles self-regulates to a constant, f∼0.5.
  * A constant f thus refers to ρ_sfr∝n^1.5

* [Improving Constraints on Fundamental Physics Parameters with the Clustering of Sunyaev-Zeldovich Selected Galaxy Clusters](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.00976)

* [Star Formation and ISM Properties in Host Galaxies of Three Far-infrared Luminous Quasars at z∼6](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.01105)

* [The nature of GRB host galaxies from chemical abundances](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.01353)
  * We compared measured abundance data from LGRB afterglow spectra to abundance patterns as predicted by our models for different galaxy types
  * We also found that in some cases changing the initial mass function can give better agreement with the observed data. The calculated ages of the host galaxies span from the order of 10 Myr to little more than 1 Gyr.

* [Black hole mass estimation for Active Galactic Nuclei from a new angle](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.01996)

* [RELICS: Reionization Lensing Cluster Survey](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.02002)
  * RELICS observed 41 massive galaxy clusters with Hubble and Spitzer at 0.4-1.7um and 3.0-5.0um, respectively. We selected 21 clusters based on Planck PSZ2 mass estimates and the other 20 based on observed or inferred lensing strength.
  * We observed 46 WFC3/IR pointings (~200 arcmin^2) with two orbits divided among four filters (F105W, F125W, F140W, and F160W) and ACS imaging as needed to achieve single-orbit depth in each of three filters (F435W, F606W, and F814W).
  * For each cluster, two HST observing epochs were staggered by about a month, enabling us to discover 11 supernovae, including 3 lensed supernovae, which we followed up with 20 orbits from our program.

* [HI galaxies with little star formation: an abundance of LIERs](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.02024)
  * We present a sample of 91 HI galaxies with little or no star formation and discuss the analysis of the integral field unit (IFU) spectra of 28 of these galaxies
  * Visual inspection of the PanSTARRS, Dark Energy Survey, and Carnegie-Irvine imaging of 62 galaxies reveals that at least 32 galaxies in the sample have low levels of star formation, primarily in arms/rings.
  * New IFU spectra of 28 of these galaxies reveal 3 galaxies with central star formation, 1 galaxy with low-ionisation nuclear emission-line regions (LINERs), 20 with extended low-ionisation emission-line regions (LIERs) and 4 with high excitation Seyfert (Sy) emission.

* [OV λλ1213.8,1218.3 emission from extended nebulae around quasars: contamination of Lyα and a new diagnostic for AGN activity in Lyα-emitters](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.02485)
  * We investigate the potential for the emission lines OV] λλ1213.8,1218.3 and HeII λ1215.1 to contaminate flux measurements of Lyα λ1215.7 in the extended nebulae of quasars
  * The contribution from OV] λλ1213.8,1218.3 is generally negligible when U is low (<10−3) and/or when the gas metallicity is low
  * At higher values of U and Z we find that OV] can significantly contaminate Lyα, in some circumstances accounting for more than half the total flux of the Lyα+HeII+OV] blend.
  * We estimate the fluxes of OV] and HeII for a sample of 107 Type 2 active galaxies at z>2, and find evidence for significant (>10\%) contamination of Lyα fluxes in the majority of cases (84\%).

* [Redshift Horizon for Detecting the First Galaxies in Far-Infared Surveys](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.02512)
  * Explore the possibility of detecting the first galaxies with the next generation of space-based far infrared (FIR) telescopes by applying an analytical model of primordial dust emission.
  * FIR/sub-mm sources at z≳7 will experience a strong negative K-correction.
  * We conclude that future FIR campaigns could play a crucial role in exploring the nature of dust and star formation in the early universe.

* [The formation of compact dwarf ellipticals through merging star clusters](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.02512)
  * It has been demonstrated that these extended objects can be the result of the merging of star clusters in cluster complex
  * With the use of numerical simulations we show that the merging star cluster scenario, adopted for higher masses, as found with those galaxies, can reproduce all major characteristics and the dynamics of these objects. This opens up a new formation channel to explain the existence of compact elliptical galaxies.

* [Cosmic web anisotropy is the primary indicator of halo assembly bias](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.02512)
  * Characterising a halo's local web environment by its tidal anisotropy α at scales ∼4 x the halo radius, we demonstrate that these multi-scale correlations represent two distinct statistical links: one between the internal property and α, and the other between α and large-scale ( >30h−1Mpc) halo bias b1
  * Our results are unaffected by the exclusion of haloes with recent major merger events or splashback objects, although the latter are distinguished by the fact that α does not explain their assembly bias trends.
  * The overarching importance of α provides a new perspective on the nature of assembly bias of distinct haloes, with potential ramifications for incorporating realistic assembly bias effects into mock catalogs of future large-scale structure surveys and for detecting galaxy assembly bias.

* [Linear bias forecasts for emission line cosmological surveys](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.02030)
  * We forecast the linear bias for Hα-emitting galaxies at high redshift. To simulate a Euclid-like and a WFIRST-like survey we place galaxies into a large-volume dark matter halo lightcone by sampling a library of luminosity-dependent halo occupation distributions
  * We calibrate the dust attenuation in the lightcones such that they are able to reproduce the Hα luminosity function or the Hα cumulative number counts
  * In each redshift bin the linear bias can be fitted with a single, scale-independent value that increases with increasing redshift. We find that the Euclid-like and WFIRST-like surveys yield linear biases that are consistent within error, as the galaxies in the two surveys occupy halos of similar mass
