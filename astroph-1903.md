* [Evident black hole-bulge coevolution in the distant universe](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.00003)
  * We have studied sample-averaged SMBH accretion rate (BHAR) for bulge-dominated galaxies at z = 0.5–3. 发现吸积率和SFR的关系更好
  * 但是在其他非bulge-dominated的样本里，黑洞吸积率还是和质量的关系更好，而没有明显的SFR相关
  * SMBH主要是和bulge共同演化: Our results reveal that SMBH and bulge growth are in lockstep, and thus non-causal scenarios of merger averaging are unlikely the origin of the MBH-Mbulge correlation.

* [The Column Density, Kinematics, and Thermal State of Metal-Bearing Gas within the Virial Radius of z~2 Star-Forming Galaxies in the Keck Baryonic Structure Survey](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.00003)
  * Keck Baryonic Structure Survey (KBSS): 红移2的L_star星系的130个有金属丰度测量的吸收气体结构
  * we infer that halo gas is kinematically complex when viewed in singly, doubly, and triply ionized species.
  * 高电离宽吸收线OVI和CIV的速度和低电离线类似，但是线结构不同，说明CGM是多Phase的
  * 100 kpc以内的气体覆盖比例很高，即便对OVI这种高电离气体也是
  * Observations of a single galaxy probed by a lensed background QSO suggest the size of metal-bearing clouds is small
  * 高速的气体外流比较常见：The gas kinematics unambiguously show that 70% of galaxies with detected metal absorption have some unbound metal-enriched gas, suggesting galactic winds may commonly eject gas from halos at z∼2.

* [Spectroscopic QUasar Extractor and redshift (z) EstimatorSQUEzE I: Methodology](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.00023)
  * SQUEzE, a software package to classify quasar spectra and estimate their redshifts

* [Host galaxies of merging compact objects: mass, star formation rate, metallicity and colours](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.00083)
  * By combining the results of MOBSE population-synthesis models together with galaxy catalogs from the EAGLE simulation, We predict that the stellar mass of the host galaxy is an excellent tracer of the merger rate per galaxy nGW of double neutron stars (DNSs), double black holes (DBHs) and black hole-neutron star binaries (BHNSs).
  * 并合率和SFR关系很好, 因此与颜色也有相关
  * Interestingly, ≳60 %, ≳64 % and ≳73 % of all the DNSs, BHNSs and DBHs merging in the local Universe lie in early-type galaxies
    * The population synthesis code mobse (Giacobbo et al. 2018) represents an upgrade of the bse code (Hurley et al. 2000, 2002) including new prescriptions for stellar winds (see Vink et al. 2001; Vink & de Koter 2005; Chen et al. 2015), core collapse supernovae (SNe) based on Fryer et al. (2012), and pair-instability and pulsational pair-instability SNe (Woosley 2017; Spera & Mapelli 2017).

* [Circumgalactic Pressure Profiles Indicate Precipitation-Limited Atmospheres for M_* ~ 10^9 - 10^11.5 M_Sun](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.00084)
  * **Interesting**
  * Using photoionization modelling of absorption lines along the QSO LOS to determine cloud pressures, we find that galaxies are surrounded by extended atmospheres that confine the clouds and have a radial pressure profile that depends on galaxy mass.
  * we compare those pressure measurements with models predicting the critical pressure at which cooler clouds start to precipitate (沉淀) out of the hot atmosphere and rain toward the center. We find excellent agreement

* [The distance, supernova rate and supernova progenitors of NGC 6946](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.00173)
  * Here we use the high supernova rate of the galaxy to derive the star-formation rate and predict the galaxy's FUV flux. We also account for dust extinction by different methods to derive a distance of 7.9+/-4.0 Mpc for NGC 6946.
  * 距离可以影响其中超新星progenitors的性质的研究，让看上去奇特的超新星变得正常

* [CO, H2O, H2O+ line and dust emission in a z = 3.63 strongly lensed starburst merger at sub-kiloparsec scales](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.00273)
  * ALMA超高分辨观测一个z=3.6的超级明亮的被透镜放大的星系，有CO和H2O的探测
  * The dust continuum and molecular gas emission are resolved into a nearly complete ~1"5 diameter Einstein ring plus a weaker image in the center
  * The reconstructed dust emission in the source plane is dominated by a compact disk with an effective radius of 0.7kpc plus an overlapping extended disk with a radius twice as large. While the average magnification for the dust continuum is μ~10-11, the magnification of the line emission varies 5 to 22 across different velocity components.

* [Fornax globular cluster distributions: implications for the cusp-core problem](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.00354)
  * 细致的模拟研究：We test two alternative hypotheses, which are a cored and a cuspy halo for Fornax by exploring a reasonable range of initial conditions on globular clusters. For Fornax cored dark matter halo, we derive a lower limit on the core size of rc >0.5 kpc.
  * Contrary to many previous works, we show also that for different initial conditions, a cuspy halo is not ruled out in our simulations based on observations of Fornax globular clusters.

* [Optical IFU spectroscopy of a bipolar microquasar jet in NGC 300](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.00005)
  * The discovery of a candidate jet-driving microquasar (S10) in the nearby spiral galaxy NGC 300
  * We present optical MUSE integral field unit (IFU) observations of S10, which reveal a bipolar line-emitting jet structure surrounding a continuum-emitting central source.

* [A New Class of X-Ray Tails of Early-Type Galaxies and Subclusters in Galaxy Clusters - Slingshot Tails vs Ram Pressure Stripped Tails](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.00482)

* [The MUSE Ultra Deep Field (MUDF). I. Discovery of a group of Lyα nebulae associated with a bright z≈3.23 quasar pair](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.00483)

* [The host galaxy of GRB 980425 / SN1998bw: a collisional ring galaxy](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.00485)
  * This is a very clear case of interaction in a gamma ray burst host galaxy, and of interaction-driven star formation giving rise to a gamma ray burst in a dense environment.

* [Lens Model and Source Reconstruction Reveal the Morphology and Star Formation Distribution in the Cool Spiral LIRG SGAS J143845.1+145407](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.00532)

* [The Global Star-Formation Law by Supernova Feedback](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.00962)
  * A simple model where the Kennicutt-Schmidt (KS) relation between the macroscopic densities of star-formation rate (SFR, ρsfr) and gas (n) in galactic discs emerges from self-regulation of the SFR via supernova feedback
  * The key is that the filling factor of SFR-suppressed supernova bubbles self-regulates to a constant, f∼0.5.
  * A constant f thus refers to ρ_sfr∝n^1.5

* [Improving Constraints on Fundamental Physics Parameters with the Clustering of Sunyaev-Zeldovich Selected Galaxy Clusters](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.00976)

* [Star Formation and ISM Properties in Host Galaxies of Three Far-infrared Luminous Quasars at z∼6](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.01105)

* [The nature of GRB host galaxies from chemical abundances](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.01353)
  * We compared measured abundance data from LGRB afterglow spectra to abundance patterns as predicted by our models for different galaxy types
  * We also found that in some cases changing the initial mass function can give better agreement with the observed data. The calculated ages of the host galaxies span from the order of 10 Myr to little more than 1 Gyr.

* [A New Class of X-Ray Tails of Early-Type Galaxies and Subclusters in Galaxy Clusters - Slingshot Tails vs Ram Pressure Stripped Tails](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.00482)

* [A New Method to Quantify Environment and Model Ram-Pressure Stripping in N-Body Simulations](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.01988)

* [The UV and Lyα Luminosity Functions of galaxies and the Star Formation Rate Density at the end of HI reionization from the VIMOS Ultra-Deep Survey (VUDS)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.01988)

* [Direct observation of the Broad Line Region in X-rays during the low state of NGC4051](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.01796)
  * NGC 4051 is one of the X-ray brightest and most variable Seyfert galaxies
  * 09年的时候是X-ray continuum最低的时候，看到了很多He-like发射线：The exceptionally high intercombination line flux is a direct measurement of either a high density or a UV irradiated photoionized plasma
  * 可以直接测宽线区大小，10^5cm: This is the first direct X-ray measurement of a Seyfert Broad Line Region.

* [The metallicity and elemental abundance maps of kinematically atypical galaxies for constraining minor merger and accretion histories](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.01597)
  * In previous work we identified five well resolved galaxies with atypical kinematics from a cosmological simulation; two had kinematically distinct cores (KDCs), and three had counter-rotating gas and stars (CRGD)
  * i) the KDC galaxies have flattening of stellar [O/Fe] at large galacto-centric radii due to the minor mergers that gave rise to the KDCs, and ii) the CRGD galaxies have an abrupt transition in the gas metallicity maps, from high metallicity in the centre to very low metallicity further out.
  * The non-linear increase in gas metallicity is also seen in the radial profiles, but when the metallicity gradients are measured, the difference is buried in the scatter of the relation

* [Ensemble photometric redshifts](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.01571)
  * There are many situations where only the statistical distribution of objects (dN/dz) in the line-of-sight direction is needed. In such situations, there is no need to measure the fluxes of individual objects in all of the surveys. Rather a stacking procedure can be used to perform an `ensemble photo-z'.
  * We show how a shallow, higher spectral resolution survey can be used to measure dN/dz for stacks of galaxies which coincide in a deeper, lower resolution survey.

* [Is it possible to reconcile extragalactic IMF variations with a universal Milky Way IMF?](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.01533)
  * **Relevant**
  * We explore what sort of cloud-scale IMF models could possibly satisfy these constraints. 指IMF从UFD到大质量椭圆星系的变化
  * 在模拟星系里重现基本的观测性质，We then consider generic models where the characteristic mass of the IMF is some arbitrary power-law function of progenitor cloud properties, along with well-known literature IMF models, which scale with Jeans mass, turbulent Bonnor-Ebert mass, temperature, the opacity limit, metallicity, or the protostellar heating mass 但都不能满足要求
  * Either the IMF varies in a more complicated manner, or alternative interpretations of the extragalactic observations must be explored.

* [A Machine Learning Artificial Neural Network Calibration of the Strong-Line Oxygen Abundance](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.01506)
  * Here, I explore the possibility of using an artificial neural network model to construct a non-linear strong-line calibration.
  * Using about 950 literature HII region spectra with auroral line detections, I build multi-layer perceptron models under the machine learning framework of training and testing.

* [Identifying reionization-epoch galaxies with extreme levels of Lyman continuum leakage in James Webb Space Telescope surveys](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.01483)
  * Here we present a machine learning framework for identifying cases of very high hydrogen-ionizing (Lyman continuum) photon escape from galaxies based on the data quality expected from potential NIRSpec observations of EoR galaxies in lensed fields.
  * Under the assumption that the simulations provide sufficiently realistic representations of actual EoR galaxies, we find that ionizing escape fractions of galaxies brighter than mAB,1500≈27 mag may be retrieved with mean absolute error Δfesc≈ 0.07 (0.11) for 10 h (1.5 h) JWST/NIRSpec exposures at resolution R=100.

* [Do BL Lac Objects and FR I radiogalaxies inhabit the same galaxy environment?](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.01935)
  * We compare the environment of a sample of 50 BL Lac objects at 0.1\<z\<0.33 with that of a sample of 90 FR I galaxies at 0.1\<z\< 0.15.
  * We find that the galaxy excess density within 0.5 Mpc around of FR I radiogalaxies is a factor ~ 2 larger than that around BL Lacs. This implies a reconsideration of the parent population of BL Lac objects.

* [Halo Exclusion Criteria Impacts Halo Statistics](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.01709)
  * **Relevant, Interesting**
  * Every halo finding algorithm must make a critical yet relatively arbitrary choice: it must decide which structures are parent halos, and which structures are sub-halos of larger halos.
  * We refer to this choice as percolation. We demonstrate that the choice of percolation impacts the statistical properties of the resulting halo catalog
  * The resulting halos exhibit significant differences in both halo abundance and clustering properties.
  * Comparable differences are observed in the large-scale clustering bias, while differences in the halo--matter correlation function reach 40% on translinear scales

* [Black hole mass estimation for Active Galactic Nuclei from a new angle](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.01996)

* [RELICS: Reionization Lensing Cluster Survey](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.02002)
  * RELICS observed 41 massive galaxy clusters with Hubble and Spitzer at 0.4-1.7um and 3.0-5.0um, respectively. We selected 21 clusters based on Planck PSZ2 mass estimates and the other 20 based on observed or inferred lensing strength.
  * We observed 46 WFC3/IR pointings (~200 arcmin^2) with two orbits divided among four filters (F105W, F125W, F140W, and F160W) and ACS imaging as needed to achieve single-orbit depth in each of three filters (F435W, F606W, and F814W).
  * For each cluster, two HST observing epochs were staggered by about a month, enabling us to discover 11 supernovae, including 3 lensed supernovae, which we followed up with 20 orbits from our program.

* [HI galaxies with little star formation: an abundance of LIERs](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.02024)
  * We present a sample of 91 HI galaxies with little or no star formation and discuss the analysis of the integral field unit (IFU) spectra of 28 of these galaxies
  * Visual inspection of the PanSTARRS, Dark Energy Survey, and Carnegie-Irvine imaging of 62 galaxies reveals that at least 32 galaxies in the sample have low levels of star formation, primarily in arms/rings.
  * New IFU spectra of 28 of these galaxies reveal 3 galaxies with central star formation, 1 galaxy with low-ionisation nuclear emission-line regions (LINERs), 20 with extended low-ionisation emission-line regions (LIERs) and 4 with high excitation Seyfert (Sy) emission.

* [OV λλ1213.8,1218.3 emission from extended nebulae around quasars: contamination of Lyα and a new diagnostic for AGN activity in Lyα-emitters](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.02485)
  * We investigate the potential for the emission lines OV] λλ1213.8,1218.3 and HeII λ1215.1 to contaminate flux measurements of Lyα λ1215.7 in the extended nebulae of quasars
  * The contribution from OV] λλ1213.8,1218.3 is generally negligible when U is low (<10−3) and/or when the gas metallicity is low
  * At higher values of U and Z we find that OV] can significantly contaminate Lyα, in some circumstances accounting for more than half the total flux of the Lyα+HeII+OV] blend.
  * We estimate the fluxes of OV] and HeII for a sample of 107 Type 2 active galaxies at z>2, and find evidence for significant (>10\%) contamination of Lyα fluxes in the majority of cases (84\%).

* [Redshift Horizon for Detecting the First Galaxies in Far-Infared Surveys](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.02512)
  * Explore the possibility of detecting the first galaxies with the next generation of space-based far infrared (FIR) telescopes by applying an analytical model of primordial dust emission.
  * FIR/sub-mm sources at z≳7 will experience a strong negative K-correction.
  * We conclude that future FIR campaigns could play a crucial role in exploring the nature of dust and star formation in the early universe.

* [The formation of compact dwarf ellipticals through merging star clusters](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.02512)
  * It has been demonstrated that these extended objects can be the result of the merging of star clusters in cluster complex
  * With the use of numerical simulations we show that the merging star cluster scenario, adopted for higher masses, as found with those galaxies, can reproduce all major characteristics and the dynamics of these objects. This opens up a new formation channel to explain the existence of compact elliptical galaxies.

* [Cosmic web anisotropy is the primary indicator of halo assembly bias](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.02512)
  * Characterising a halo's local web environment by its tidal anisotropy α at scales ∼4 x the halo radius, we demonstrate that these multi-scale correlations represent two distinct statistical links: one between the internal property and α, and the other between α and large-scale ( >30h−1Mpc) halo bias b1
  * Our results are unaffected by the exclusion of haloes with recent major merger events or splashback objects, although the latter are distinguished by the fact that α does not explain their assembly bias trends.
  * The overarching importance of α provides a new perspective on the nature of assembly bias of distinct haloes, with potential ramifications for incorporating realistic assembly bias effects into mock catalogs of future large-scale structure surveys and for detecting galaxy assembly bias.

* [Linear bias forecasts for emission line cosmological surveys](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.02030)
  * We forecast the linear bias for Hα-emitting galaxies at high redshift. To simulate a Euclid-like and a WFIRST-like survey we place galaxies into a large-volume dark matter halo lightcone by sampling a library of luminosity-dependent halo occupation distributions
  * We calibrate the dust attenuation in the lightcones such that they are able to reproduce the Hα luminosity function or the Hα cumulative number counts
  * In each redshift bin the linear bias can be fitted with a single, scale-independent value that increases with increasing redshift. We find that the Euclid-like and WFIRST-like surveys yield linear biases that are consistent within error, as the galaxies in the two surveys occupy halos of similar mass

### Mar 7

* [Using Torque to Understand Barred Galaxy Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.02566)
  * We find evidence for three distinct phases of barred galaxy evolution: assembly, secular growth, and steady-state equilibrium.
  * We find that the halo model mediates the assembly and growth of the bar for a high central density halo, and the outer disc mediates the assembly and growth of the bar in a low central density halo model.
  * Both galaxies exhibit a steady-state equilibrium phase where the bar is neither lengthening nor slowing. The steady-state equilibrium results from the balance of torque between particles that are gaining and losing angular momentum

* [The survey of Planetary Nebulae in Andromeda (M31): I. Imaging the disk and halo with MegaCam@CFHT](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.02597)
  * PNe were identified based on their bright OIII 5007 Å emission and absence of a continuum.
  * We identify 4289 PNe, of which only 1099 were previously known. By comparing the PN number density with the surface brightness profile of M31 out to ~30 kpc along the minor-axis, we find that the stellar population in the inner halo has a 7 times larger luminosity-specific PN number value than that of the disk
  * 关于PNLF：Interestingly, it shows a significant rise at the faint end, present in all radial bins covered by the survey, much steeper than that observed for the Magellanic clouds and Milky Way bulge. M31 shows two major episodes of star formation and the rise in the faint end of the PNLF is possibly associated with the older stellar population.

* [An ALMA survey of the SCUBA-2 Cosmology Legacy Survey UKIDSS/UDS field: Source catalogue and properties](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.02602)
  * AS2UDS, an 870-μm continuum survey with the Atacama Large Millimetre/sub-millimetre Array (ALMA) of 716 single-dish sub-millimetre sources detected in the UKIDSS/UDS field by the SCUBA-2 Cosmology Legacy Survey.
  * We detect 708 sub-millimetre galaxies (SMGs) at > 4.3σ significance
  * This large sample reveals a statistically significant trend of increasing sub-millimetre flux with redshift suggestive of galaxy downsizing.
  * we combine X-ray and mid-infrared active galaxy nuclei activity (AGN) indicators to yield a likely range for the AGN fraction of 8–28 % in our sample.

* [ALMA twenty-six arcmin2 survey of GOODS-S at one-millimeter (ASAGAO): Near-infrared-dark faint ALMA sources](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.02744)
  * 近红外dark的弱毫米波源：We report detections of two 1.2 mm continuum sources (S1.2mm ~ 0.6 mJy) without any counterparts in the deep H- and/or K-band image
  * One has a red IRAC (3.6 and 4.5 μm) counterpart, and the other has been independently detected at 850 and 870 μm using SCUBA2 and ALMA Band 7
  * Their optical to radio spectral energy distributions indicate that they can lie at z≳ 3-5 and can be in the early phase of massive galaxy formation
  * 对SFR密度的贡献：can be consistent with, or greater than that of bright submillimeter galaxies (S870μm> 4.2 mJy) at z ~ 3-5.

* [Pre-processing of galaxies in cosmic filaments around AMASCFI clusters in the CFHTLS](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.02879)
  * We detected cosmic filaments around galaxy clusters using photometric redshifts in the range 0.15 < z < 0.7.
  * The filament reconstruction was done with the DISPERSE al- gorithm in photometric redshift slices.
  * We showed that the AMASCFI cluster connectivity (i.e. the number of filaments connecting to a cluster) increases with cluster mass M200.
  * Passive galaxies in filaments are closer to clusters than star-forming galaxies in the low redshift bin only. The passive fraction of galaxies decreases with increasing clustercentric distance up to d ∼ 5 cMpc.

* [High density of active galactic nuclei in the outskirts of distant galaxy clusters](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.02919)
  * **Interesting**
  * 看Planck和SPT找到的z~1的最大质量的星系团的AGN分布
  * For our purposes, we computed the X-ray point-like source surface density in 0.5RYx500 wide annuli up to a clustercentric distance of 4RYx500
  * We found a significant excess of X-ray point sources between 2 and 2.5RYx500 at the 99.9\% confidence level
  * The results clearly display for the first time strong observational evidence of AGN triggering in the outskirts of high-redshift massive clusters with such a high statistical significance.

  * **Interesting, Useful**

* [Spatially resolved carbon and oxygen isotopic ratios in NGC 253 using optically thin tracers](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.03244)
  * Spatially resolve the carbon and oxygen isotope ratios across the central molecular zone (full size ~∼600 pc) in the nearby starburst galaxy NGC 253
  * First extragalactic detection of the double isotopologue 13C18O
  * The molecular clouds in the central region of NGC 253 show similar rare isotope enrichment to those within the central molecular zone of the Milky way.
  * This enrichment is attributed to stellar nucleosynthesis. Measured isotopic ratios suggest an enhancement of 18O as compared to our Galactic center, which we attribute to an extra 18O injection from massive stars.
  * We observe an extra molecular component of highly processed gas on top of the already proposed less processed gas being transported to the central region of NGC 253. Such multicomponent nature and optical depth effects may hinder the use of isotopic ratios based on spatially unresolved line to infer the star formation history and/or initial stellar mass function properties in the nuclei of galaxies.

### Mar 11

* [On the Origin of the Scatter in the Red Sequence: An Analysis of Four CLASH Clusters](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.03618)
  * **Interesting, Relevant**
  * In four CLASH clusters at z = 0.355 ± 0.007, we find that the optical-IR galaxy colors confirm the previously known trend of metallicity along the red sequence but also show a strong connection between stellar age and red sequence offset, with ages ranging from 3 to 8 Gyr.
  * While we will extend this analysis to the full CLASH sample, in four clusters our technique already provides a color precision in near-total-light apertures to resolve the spread in stellar population formation ages that drives the scatter in the red sequence.

* [On the origin of star-gas counterrotation in low-mass galaxies](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.03627)
  * Illustris模拟里看逆向旋转的恒星和气体盘：Only ∼1% of our sample shows a counterrotating gaseous disk at z=0. These counterrotating disks arise in galaxies that have had a significant episode of gas removal followed by the acquisition of new gas with misaligned angular momentum.
  * In our simulations, we identify two main channels responsible for the gas loss: a strong feedback burst and gas stripping during a fly-by passage through a more massive group environment.

* [The role of gas fragmentation during the formation of supermassive black holes](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.03637)
  * hydrodynamic simulations to study the effect of fragmentation on the SMBH seed mass in the direct collapse formation scenario
  * Our simulations in low-spin halos, in the presence of a strong UV background are consistent with the Direct Collapse Black Hole model
  * While in our simulations under the presence of a low UV background, we find fragmentation and the formation of various minor seeds. 10^3-10^4 Msun的seed，如果能并合还是很显著的

* [The role of gas fragmentation during the formation of supermassive black holes](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.03637)
  * A Spectroscopic Census of X-ray Systems in the COSMOS Field
  * The COSMOS X-ray system catalog we use (George et al. 2011) includes 180 X-ray systems
  * We identify 1843 spectroscopic redshifts of member candidates in these X-ray systems. The X-ray luminosity (LX) - velocity dispersion (σv) scaling relation of the COSMOS X-ray systems is consistent with that of massive X-ray clusters.

* [A 5deg x 5deg deep HI survey of the M81 group](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.03767)
  * A 25 deg2 region, including the M81 complex (M81, M82, NGC 3077), NGC 2976 and IC2574, was mapped during ~3000 hours with the DRAO synthesis telescope. With a physical resolution of ~1 kpc
  * This supports the assumption that intergalactic gas and galaxies in the system participate to a large-scale ordered rotation motion which is dominated by M81.

* [Testing the rotation versus merger scenario in the galaxy cluster Abell 2107](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.03858)
  * Search for global rotation of the intracluster medium (ICM) in the galaxy cluster Abell 2107
  * By fitting the centroid of the iron Kα line complex at 6.7–6.9 keV rest frame in Chandra ACIS-I spectra, we identify the possible rotation axis 
  * A more conservative interpretation may be provided by an unnoticed off-center, head-on collision between two comparable halos. Our analysis confirms the peculiar dynamical nature of the otherwise regular cluster Abell 2107, but is not able to resolve the rotation vs merger scenario,

* [High- and Low-α Disk Stars Separate Dynamically at all Ages](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.04030)
  * **Interesting**
  * We find that \emph{at all ages}, the high- and low-α sequences are dynamically distinct. This implies separate formation and evolutionary histories for the two sequences; a star's membership in the high- or low-α sequence indicates its dynamical properties at a given time.

  * 三个很近的QSO视线方向上的HI-CIV吸收系统： The ionization models are consistent with the origin of metal lines and H I from a cool and diffuse photoionized gas phase with T≲4×104 K and nH≲5×10−4 cm−3
  * The RXJ~1230.8+0115 sightline traces the outskirt regions of the Virgo cluster where the absorber is found to have super-solar metallicity. 
  * The detection of metal lines along with H I has enabled us to confirm the presence of cool, diffuse gas possibly enriched by outflows and tidal interactions in environments with significant galaxy density.

  * **Relevant**
  * At such faint levels the structure of NGC 1533 appear amazingly disturbed with clear structural asymmetry between inner and outer isophotes in the North-East direction.
  * We detect new spiral arm-like tails in the outskirts, which might likely be the signature of a past interaction/merging event. Similarly, IC 2038 and IC 2039 show tails and distortions indicative of their ongoing interaction. 

* [A New, Deep JVLA Radio Survey of M33](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.04434)
  * We have performed new 1.4 GHz and 5 GHz observations of the Local Group galaxy M33 with the Jansky Very Large Array
  * Using a new multi-resolution algorithm, we have created a catalog of 2875 sources, including 675 with well-determined spectral indices. We detect sources at the position of 319 of the X-ray sources in the Tuellmann et al. (2011) Chandra survey of M33, the majority of which are likely to be background galaxies.
  * we detect 155 of the 217 optical supernova remnants included in the lists of Long et al. (2010) and Lee & Lee (2014), making this by far the largest sample of remnants at known distances with multiwavelength coverage
