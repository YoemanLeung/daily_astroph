* [Evident black hole-bulge coevolution in the distant universe](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.00003)
  * We have studied sample-averaged SMBH accretion rate (BHAR) for bulge-dominated galaxies at z = 0.5–3. 发现吸积率和SFR的关系更好
  * 但是在其他非bulge-dominated的样本里，黑洞吸积率还是和质量的关系更好，而没有明显的SFR相关
  * SMBH主要是和bulge共同演化: Our results reveal that SMBH and bulge growth are in lockstep, and thus non-causal scenarios of merger averaging are unlikely the origin of the MBH-Mbulge correlation.

* [The Column Density, Kinematics, and Thermal State of Metal-Bearing Gas within the Virial Radius of z~2 Star-Forming Galaxies in the Keck Baryonic Structure Survey](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.00003)
  * Keck Baryonic Structure Survey (KBSS): 红移2的L_star星系的130个有金属丰度测量的吸收气体结构
  * we infer that halo gas is kinematically complex when viewed in singly, doubly, and triply ionized species.
  * 高电离宽吸收线OVI和CIV的速度和低电离线类似，但是线结构不同，说明CGM是多Phase的
  * 100 kpc以内的气体覆盖比例很高，即便对OVI这种高电离气体也是
  * Observations of a single galaxy probed by a lensed background QSO suggest the size of metal-bearing clouds is small
  * 高速的气体外流比较常见：The gas kinematics unambiguously show that 70% of galaxies with detected metal absorption have some unbound metal-enriched gas, suggesting galactic winds may commonly eject gas from halos at z∼2.

* [Spectroscopic QUasar Extractor and redshift (z) EstimatorSQUEzE I: Methodology](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.00023)
  * SQUEzE, a software package to classify quasar spectra and estimate their redshifts

* [Host galaxies of merging compact objects: mass, star formation rate, metallicity and colours](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.00083)
  * By combining the results of MOBSE population-synthesis models together with galaxy catalogs from the EAGLE simulation, We predict that the stellar mass of the host galaxy is an excellent tracer of the merger rate per galaxy nGW of double neutron stars (DNSs), double black holes (DBHs) and black hole-neutron star binaries (BHNSs).
  * 并合率和SFR关系很好, 因此与颜色也有相关
  * Interestingly, ≳60 %, ≳64 % and ≳73 % of all the DNSs, BHNSs and DBHs merging in the local Universe lie in early-type galaxies
    * The population synthesis code mobse (Giacobbo et al. 2018) represents an upgrade of the bse code (Hurley et al. 2000, 2002) including new prescriptions for stellar winds (see Vink et al. 2001; Vink & de Koter 2005; Chen et al. 2015), core collapse supernovae (SNe) based on Fryer et al. (2012), and pair-instability and pulsational pair-instability SNe (Woosley 2017; Spera & Mapelli 2017).

* [Circumgalactic Pressure Profiles Indicate Precipitation-Limited Atmospheres for M_* ~ 10^9 - 10^11.5 M_Sun](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.00084)
  * **Interesting**
  * Using photoionization modelling of absorption lines along the QSO LOS to determine cloud pressures, we find that galaxies are surrounded by extended atmospheres that confine the clouds and have a radial pressure profile that depends on galaxy mass. 
  * we compare those pressure measurements with models predicting the critical pressure at which cooler clouds start to precipitate (沉淀) out of the hot atmosphere and rain toward the center. We find excellent agreement

* [The distance, supernova rate and supernova progenitors of NGC 6946](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.00173)
  * Here we use the high supernova rate of the galaxy to derive the star-formation rate and predict the galaxy's FUV flux. We also account for dust extinction by different methods to derive a distance of 7.9+/-4.0 Mpc for NGC 6946.
  * 距离可以影响其中超新星progenitors的性质的研究，让看上去奇特的超新星变得正常

* [CO, H2O, H2O+ line and dust emission in a z = 3.63 strongly lensed starburst merger at sub-kiloparsec scales](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.00273)
  * ALMA超高分辨观测一个z=3.6的超级明亮的被透镜放大的星系，有CO和H2O的探测
  * The dust continuum and molecular gas emission are resolved into a nearly complete ~1"5 diameter Einstein ring plus a weaker image in the center
  * The reconstructed dust emission in the source plane is dominated by a compact disk with an effective radius of 0.7kpc plus an overlapping extended disk with a radius twice as large. While the average magnification for the dust continuum is μ~10-11, the magnification of the line emission varies 5 to 22 across different velocity components.

* [Fornax globular cluster distributions: implications for the cusp-core problem](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.00354)
  * 细致的模拟研究：We test two alternative hypotheses, which are a cored and a cuspy halo for Fornax by exploring a reasonable range of initial conditions on globular clusters. For Fornax cored dark matter halo, we derive a lower limit on the core size of rc >0.5 kpc. 
  * Contrary to many previous works, we show also that for different initial conditions, a cuspy halo is not ruled out in our simulations based on observations of Fornax globular clusters.

* [Optical IFU spectroscopy of a bipolar microquasar jet in NGC 300](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.00005)
  * The discovery of a candidate jet-driving microquasar (S10) in the nearby spiral galaxy NGC 300
  * We present optical MUSE integral field unit (IFU) observations of S10, which reveal a bipolar line-emitting jet structure surrounding a continuum-emitting central source.
