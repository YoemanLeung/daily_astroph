* [Evident black hole-bulge coevolution in the distant universe](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.00003)
  * We have studied sample-averaged SMBH accretion rate (BHAR) for bulge-dominated galaxies at z = 0.5–3. 发现吸积率和SFR的关系更好
  * 但是在其他非bulge-dominated的样本里，黑洞吸积率还是和质量的关系更好，而没有明显的SFR相关
  * SMBH主要是和bulge共同演化: Our results reveal that SMBH and bulge growth are in lockstep, and thus non-causal scenarios of merger averaging are unlikely the origin of the MBH-Mbulge correlation.

* [The Column Density, Kinematics, and Thermal State of Metal-Bearing Gas within the Virial Radius of z~2 Star-Forming Galaxies in the Keck Baryonic Structure Survey](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.00003)
  * Keck Baryonic Structure Survey (KBSS): 红移2的L_star星系的130个有金属丰度测量的吸收气体结构
  * we infer that halo gas is kinematically complex when viewed in singly, doubly, and triply ionized species.
  * 高电离宽吸收线OVI和CIV的速度和低电离线类似，但是线结构不同，说明CGM是多Phase的
  * 100 kpc以内的气体覆盖比例很高，即便对OVI这种高电离气体也是
  * Observations of a single galaxy probed by a lensed background QSO suggest the size of metal-bearing clouds is small
  * 高速的气体外流比较常见：The gas kinematics unambiguously show that 70% of galaxies with detected metal absorption have some unbound metal-enriched gas, suggesting galactic winds may commonly eject gas from halos at z∼2.

* [Spectroscopic QUasar Extractor and redshift (z) EstimatorSQUEzE I: Methodology](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.00023)
  * SQUEzE, a software package to classify quasar spectra and estimate their redshifts

* [Host galaxies of merging compact objects: mass, star formation rate, metallicity and colours](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.00083)
  * By combining the results of MOBSE population-synthesis models together with galaxy catalogs from the EAGLE simulation, We predict that the stellar mass of the host galaxy is an excellent tracer of the merger rate per galaxy nGW of double neutron stars (DNSs), double black holes (DBHs) and black hole-neutron star binaries (BHNSs).
  * 并合率和SFR关系很好, 因此与颜色也有相关
  * Interestingly, ≳60 %, ≳64 % and ≳73 % of all the DNSs, BHNSs and DBHs merging in the local Universe lie in early-type galaxies
    * The population synthesis code mobse (Giacobbo et al. 2018) represents an upgrade of the bse code (Hurley et al. 2000, 2002) including new prescriptions for stellar winds (see Vink et al. 2001; Vink & de Koter 2005; Chen et al. 2015), core collapse supernovae (SNe) based on Fryer et al. (2012), and pair-instability and pulsational pair-instability SNe (Woosley 2017; Spera & Mapelli 2017).

* [Circumgalactic Pressure Profiles Indicate Precipitation-Limited Atmospheres for M_* ~ 10^9 - 10^11.5 M_Sun](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.00084)
  * **Interesting**
  * Using photoionization modelling of absorption lines along the QSO LOS to determine cloud pressures, we find that galaxies are surrounded by extended atmospheres that confine the clouds and have a radial pressure profile that depends on galaxy mass.
  * we compare those pressure measurements with models predicting the critical pressure at which cooler clouds start to precipitate (沉淀) out of the hot atmosphere and rain toward the center. We find excellent agreement

* [The distance, supernova rate and supernova progenitors of NGC 6946](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.00173)
  * Here we use the high supernova rate of the galaxy to derive the star-formation rate and predict the galaxy's FUV flux. We also account for dust extinction by different methods to derive a distance of 7.9+/-4.0 Mpc for NGC 6946.
  * 距离可以影响其中超新星progenitors的性质的研究，让看上去奇特的超新星变得正常

* [CO, H2O, H2O+ line and dust emission in a z = 3.63 strongly lensed starburst merger at sub-kiloparsec scales](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.00273)
  * ALMA超高分辨观测一个z=3.6的超级明亮的被透镜放大的星系，有CO和H2O的探测
  * The dust continuum and molecular gas emission are resolved into a nearly complete ~1"5 diameter Einstein ring plus a weaker image in the center
  * The reconstructed dust emission in the source plane is dominated by a compact disk with an effective radius of 0.7kpc plus an overlapping extended disk with a radius twice as large. While the average magnification for the dust continuum is μ~10-11, the magnification of the line emission varies 5 to 22 across different velocity components.

* [Fornax globular cluster distributions: implications for the cusp-core problem](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.00354)
  * 细致的模拟研究：We test two alternative hypotheses, which are a cored and a cuspy halo for Fornax by exploring a reasonable range of initial conditions on globular clusters. For Fornax cored dark matter halo, we derive a lower limit on the core size of rc >0.5 kpc.
  * Contrary to many previous works, we show also that for different initial conditions, a cuspy halo is not ruled out in our simulations based on observations of Fornax globular clusters.

* [Optical IFU spectroscopy of a bipolar microquasar jet in NGC 300](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.00005)
  * The discovery of a candidate jet-driving microquasar (S10) in the nearby spiral galaxy NGC 300
  * We present optical MUSE integral field unit (IFU) observations of S10, which reveal a bipolar line-emitting jet structure surrounding a continuum-emitting central source.

* [A New Class of X-Ray Tails of Early-Type Galaxies and Subclusters in Galaxy Clusters - Slingshot Tails vs Ram Pressure Stripped Tails](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.00482)
  * there is a new class of gas tails - slingshot tails - which form as a subhalo (i.e. a subcluster or early-type cluster galaxy) moves away from the cluster center towards the apocenter of its orbit.
  * 不能简单的用tail的方向来判断subhalo的运动：These tails can point perpendicular or even opposite to the subhalo direction of motion, not tracing the recent orbital path. Thus, the observed tail direction can be misleading, and we caution against naive conclusions regarding the subhalo’s direction of motion based on the tail direction.
  * During the slingshot tail stage, the subhalo is not being ram pressure stripped (RPS) and the tail is shaped by tidal forces more than just the ram pressure.

* [The MUSE Ultra Deep Field (MUDF). I. Discovery of a group of Lyα nebulae associated with a bright z≈3.23 quasar pair](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.00483)
  * The ≈ 40-hour observation completed to date reveals the presence of a group of three Lyα nebulae associated with a bright quasar pair at z ≃ 3.23 with projected separation of ≈ 500 kpc
  * Two of the nebulae are physically associated with the quasars which are likely powering the Lyα emission, and extend for >100 kpc
  * Despite their clustered nature, the two large nebulae have properties similar to those observed in isolated quasars and exhibit no sharp decline in flux at the current depth, suggesting an even more extended distribution of gas around the quasars

* [The host galaxy of GRB 980425 / SN1998bw: a collisional ring galaxy](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.00485)
  * This is a very clear case of interaction in a gamma ray burst host galaxy, and of interaction-driven star formation giving rise to a gamma ray burst in a dense environment.

* [Lens Model and Source Reconstruction Reveal the Morphology and Star Formation Distribution in the Cool Spiral LIRG SGAS J143845.1+145407](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.00532)
  * Hubble Space Telescope (HST) imaging and grism spectroscopy of a strongly lensed LIRG at z = 0.816, SGAS 143845.1+145407, and use the magnification boost of gravitational lensing to study the distribution of star formation throughout this galaxy
  * We find widespread star formation across this galaxy, in agreement with the current understanding of these objects. However, we note a deficit of Hα emission in the nucleus of SGAS 143845.1+145407, likely due to dust extinction.

* [The Global Star-Formation Law by Supernova Feedback](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.00962)
  * A simple model where the Kennicutt-Schmidt (KS) relation between the macroscopic densities of star-formation rate (SFR, ρsfr) and gas (n) in galactic discs emerges from self-regulation of the SFR via supernova feedback
  * The key is that the filling factor of SFR-suppressed supernova bubbles self-regulates to a constant, f∼0.5.
  * A constant f thus refers to ρ_sfr∝n^1.5

* [Improving Constraints on Fundamental Physics Parameters with the Clustering of Sunyaev-Zeldovich Selected Galaxy Clusters](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.00976)
  * **Important**
  * Late-time structure growth is highly sensitive to extensions to the standard cosmological model (ΛCDM), such as the sum of the neutrino masses, the dark energy equation of state, and modifications to general relativity. The nominal statistic used for cluster observations is their abundances as a function of redshift. We investigate what additional cosmological information is gained after including the clustering signal of clusters, the cluster power spectrum.
  * We forecast the cluster power spectra for the upcoming Simons Observatory and a CMB Stage-4-like experiment and find that the cluster power spectrum reduces marginalized constraints on the dark energy equation of state by 4--13% and the growth index by 6--9%

* [Star Formation and ISM Properties in Host Galaxies of Three Far-infrared Luminous Quasars at z∼6](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.01105)
  * VLA observations of the CO (2−1) line emission
  * All three sources are detected in the CO (2−1) line emission -- one source is marginally resolved, and the other two appear as point sources.
  * an analysis of the photo-dissociation regions associated with the three high redshift quasars indicates that the interstellar medium in these sources has similar properties to local starburst galaxies.

* [The nature of GRB host galaxies from chemical abundances](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.01353)
  * We compared measured abundance data from LGRB afterglow spectra to abundance patterns as predicted by our models for different galaxy types
  * We also found that in some cases changing the initial mass function can give better agreement with the observed data. The calculated ages of the host galaxies span from the order of 10 Myr to little more than 1 Gyr.

### Mar 5

* [A New Method to Quantify Environment and Model Ram-Pressure Stripping in N-Body Simulations](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.01988)
  * **Interesting**
  * We introduce a Local Background Environment (LBE) estimator that can be measured in and around every galaxy or its dark matter subhalo in high-resolution cosmological simulations. 用来研究模拟里环境对星系的影响，如冲压剥离这类过程
    * The density of the LBE, ρLBE, is the number density of simulation particles within this spherical shell multiplied by the particle mass. The nett velocity of the LBE, v LBE is the mean velocity of these shell particles. 这是刨除了central星系和subhalo之后的
  * We define the LBE directly from the particle data within an adaptive spherical shell, and devise a Gaussian mixture estimator to separate background particles from previously unidentified subhalo particles.
  * Significantly, there is no abrupt change in LBE velocity or density at the halo virial radius. This suggests that stripping should also happen beyond this radius. 所以实际的气体剥离过程更长，更重要
  * Central galaxies, as well as satellites beyond the virial radius, can lose a signif- icant fraction of their hot halo gas. As a result, the gas fractions and star formation rates of satellite galaxies are suppressed relative to the fiducial model,

* [The UV and Lyα Luminosity Functions of galaxies and the Star Formation Rate Density at the end of HI reionization from the VIMOS Ultra-Deep Survey (VUDS)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.01988)

* [Direct observation of the Broad Line Region in X-rays during the low state of NGC4051](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.01796)
  * NGC 4051 is one of the X-ray brightest and most variable Seyfert galaxies
  * 09年的时候是X-ray continuum最低的时候，看到了很多He-like发射线：The exceptionally high intercombination line flux is a direct measurement of either a high density or a UV irradiated photoionized plasma
  * 可以直接测宽线区大小，10^5cm: This is the first direct X-ray measurement of a Seyfert Broad Line Region.

* [The metallicity and elemental abundance maps of kinematically atypical galaxies for constraining minor merger and accretion histories](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.01597)
  * In previous work we identified five well resolved galaxies with atypical kinematics from a cosmological simulation; two had kinematically distinct cores (KDCs), and three had counter-rotating gas and stars (CRGD)
  * i) the KDC galaxies have flattening of stellar [O/Fe] at large galacto-centric radii due to the minor mergers that gave rise to the KDCs, and ii) the CRGD galaxies have an abrupt transition in the gas metallicity maps, from high metallicity in the centre to very low metallicity further out.
  * The non-linear increase in gas metallicity is also seen in the radial profiles, but when the metallicity gradients are measured, the difference is buried in the scatter of the relation

* [Ensemble photometric redshifts](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.01571)
  * There are many situations where only the statistical distribution of objects (dN/dz) in the line-of-sight direction is needed. In such situations, there is no need to measure the fluxes of individual objects in all of the surveys. Rather a stacking procedure can be used to perform an `ensemble photo-z'.
  * We show how a shallow, higher spectral resolution survey can be used to measure dN/dz for stacks of galaxies which coincide in a deeper, lower resolution survey.

* [Is it possible to reconcile extragalactic IMF variations with a universal Milky Way IMF?](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.01533)
  * **Relevant**
  * We explore what sort of cloud-scale IMF models could possibly satisfy these constraints. 指IMF从UFD到大质量椭圆星系的变化
  * 在模拟星系里重现基本的观测性质，We then consider generic models where the characteristic mass of the IMF is some arbitrary power-law function of progenitor cloud properties, along with well-known literature IMF models, which scale with Jeans mass, turbulent Bonnor-Ebert mass, temperature, the opacity limit, metallicity, or the protostellar heating mass 但都不能满足要求
  * Either the IMF varies in a more complicated manner, or alternative interpretations of the extragalactic observations must be explored.

* [A Machine Learning Artificial Neural Network Calibration of the Strong-Line Oxygen Abundance](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.01506)
  * Here, I explore the possibility of using an artificial neural network model to construct a non-linear strong-line calibration.
  * Using about 950 literature HII region spectra with auroral line detections, I build multi-layer perceptron models under the machine learning framework of training and testing.

* [Identifying reionization-epoch galaxies with extreme levels of Lyman continuum leakage in James Webb Space Telescope surveys](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.01483)
  * Here we present a machine learning framework for identifying cases of very high hydrogen-ionizing (Lyman continuum) photon escape from galaxies based on the data quality expected from potential NIRSpec observations of EoR galaxies in lensed fields.
  * Under the assumption that the simulations provide sufficiently realistic representations of actual EoR galaxies, we find that ionizing escape fractions of galaxies brighter than mAB,1500≈27 mag may be retrieved with mean absolute error Δfesc≈ 0.07 (0.11) for 10 h (1.5 h) JWST/NIRSpec exposures at resolution R=100.

* [Do BL Lac Objects and FR I radiogalaxies inhabit the same galaxy environment?](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.01935)
  * We compare the environment of a sample of 50 BL Lac objects at 0.1\<z\<0.33 with that of a sample of 90 FR I galaxies at 0.1\<z\< 0.15.
  * We find that the galaxy excess density within 0.5 Mpc around of FR I radiogalaxies is a factor ~ 2 larger than that around BL Lacs. This implies a reconsideration of the parent population of BL Lac objects.

* [Halo Exclusion Criteria Impacts Halo Statistics](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.01709)
  * **Relevant, Interesting**
  * Every halo finding algorithm must make a critical yet relatively arbitrary choice: it must decide which structures are parent halos, and which structures are sub-halos of larger halos.
  * We refer to this choice as percolation. We demonstrate that the choice of percolation impacts the statistical properties of the resulting halo catalog
  * The resulting halos exhibit significant differences in both halo abundance and clustering properties.
  * Comparable differences are observed in the large-scale clustering bias, while differences in the halo--matter correlation function reach 40% on translinear scales

* [Black hole mass estimation for Active Galactic Nuclei from a new angle](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.01996)
  * **Interesting**
  * In this work, we use a novel algorithm that identifies smooth trends in complex datasets and apply it to a sample of 2 000 type I active galactic nuclei (AGN) spectra.
  * We detect a sequence in emission line shapes and strengths which reveals a correlation between the narrow L([OIII])/L(Hβ) line ratio and the width of the broad Hα.
  * This scaling relation ties the kinematics of the gas clouds in the broad line region to the ionisation state of the narrow line region
  * This relation can be used to estimate black hole masses from narrow emission lines only. It therefore enables black hole mass estimation for obscured type II AGN and allows us to explore the connection between black holes and host galaxy properties for thousands of objects, well beyond the local Universe.

* [RELICS: Reionization Lensing Cluster Survey](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.02002)
  * RELICS observed 41 massive galaxy clusters with Hubble and Spitzer at 0.4-1.7um and 3.0-5.0um, respectively. We selected 21 clusters based on Planck PSZ2 mass estimates and the other 20 based on observed or inferred lensing strength.
  * We observed 46 WFC3/IR pointings (~200 arcmin^2) with two orbits divided among four filters (F105W, F125W, F140W, and F160W) and ACS imaging as needed to achieve single-orbit depth in each of three filters (F435W, F606W, and F814W).
  * For each cluster, two HST observing epochs were staggered by about a month, enabling us to discover 11 supernovae, including 3 lensed supernovae, which we followed up with 20 orbits from our program.

* [HI galaxies with little star formation: an abundance of LIERs](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.02024)
  * We present a sample of 91 HI galaxies with little or no star formation and discuss the analysis of the integral field unit (IFU) spectra of 28 of these galaxies
  * Visual inspection of the PanSTARRS, Dark Energy Survey, and Carnegie-Irvine imaging of 62 galaxies reveals that at least 32 galaxies in the sample have low levels of star formation, primarily in arms/rings.
  * New IFU spectra of 28 of these galaxies reveal 3 galaxies with central star formation, 1 galaxy with low-ionisation nuclear emission-line regions (LINERs), 20 with extended low-ionisation emission-line regions (LIERs) and 4 with high excitation Seyfert (Sy) emission.

* [OV λλ1213.8,1218.3 emission from extended nebulae around quasars: contamination of Lyα and a new diagnostic for AGN activity in Lyα-emitters](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.02485)
  * We investigate the potential for the emission lines OV] λλ1213.8,1218.3 and HeII λ1215.1 to contaminate flux measurements of Lyα λ1215.7 in the extended nebulae of quasars
  * The contribution from OV] λλ1213.8,1218.3 is generally negligible when U is low (<10−3) and/or when the gas metallicity is low
  * At higher values of U and Z we find that OV] can significantly contaminate Lyα, in some circumstances accounting for more than half the total flux of the Lyα+HeII+OV] blend.
  * We estimate the fluxes of OV] and HeII for a sample of 107 Type 2 active galaxies at z>2, and find evidence for significant (>10\%) contamination of Lyα fluxes in the majority of cases (84\%).

* [Redshift Horizon for Detecting the First Galaxies in Far-Infared Surveys](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.02512)
  * Explore the possibility of detecting the first galaxies with the next generation of space-based far infrared (FIR) telescopes by applying an analytical model of primordial dust emission.
  * FIR/sub-mm sources at z≳7 will experience a strong negative K-correction.
  * We conclude that future FIR campaigns could play a crucial role in exploring the nature of dust and star formation in the early universe.

* [The formation of compact dwarf ellipticals through merging star clusters](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.02512)
  * It has been demonstrated that these extended objects can be the result of the merging of star clusters in cluster complex
  * With the use of numerical simulations we show that the merging star cluster scenario, adopted for higher masses, as found with those galaxies, can reproduce all major characteristics and the dynamics of these objects. This opens up a new formation channel to explain the existence of compact elliptical galaxies.

* [Cosmic web anisotropy is the primary indicator of halo assembly bias](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.02512)
  * Characterising a halo's local web environment by its tidal anisotropy α at scales ∼4 x the halo radius, we demonstrate that these multi-scale correlations represent two distinct statistical links: one between the internal property and α, and the other between α and large-scale ( >30h−1Mpc) halo bias b1
  * Our results are unaffected by the exclusion of haloes with recent major merger events or splashback objects, although the latter are distinguished by the fact that α does not explain their assembly bias trends.
  * The overarching importance of α provides a new perspective on the nature of assembly bias of distinct haloes, with potential ramifications for incorporating realistic assembly bias effects into mock catalogs of future large-scale structure surveys and for detecting galaxy assembly bias.

* [Linear bias forecasts for emission line cosmological surveys](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.02030)
  * We forecast the linear bias for Hα-emitting galaxies at high redshift. To simulate a Euclid-like and a WFIRST-like survey we place galaxies into a large-volume dark matter halo lightcone by sampling a library of luminosity-dependent halo occupation distributions
  * We calibrate the dust attenuation in the lightcones such that they are able to reproduce the Hα luminosity function or the Hα cumulative number counts
  * In each redshift bin the linear bias can be fitted with a single, scale-independent value that increases with increasing redshift. We find that the Euclid-like and WFIRST-like surveys yield linear biases that are consistent within error, as the galaxies in the two surveys occupy halos of similar mass

* [A Pre-Merger Stage Galaxy Cluster: Abell 3733](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.02030)
  * According to X-ray luminosity map, A3733 hosts two sub-structures separated in the sky by ∼ 0.25 Mpc
  * Both sub-structures are found to be hosting cool central gas (kT ∼ 1.5-2.5 keV) surrounded by hotter gas (kT ∼ 3.0-3.5 keV). Besides, the X-ray concentration parameters are found to be c ∼ 0.3 for each sub-structure.

### Mar 7

* [Using Torque to Understand Barred Galaxy Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.02566)
  * We find evidence for three distinct phases of barred galaxy evolution: assembly, secular growth, and steady-state equilibrium.
  * We find that the halo model mediates the assembly and growth of the bar for a high central density halo, and the outer disc mediates the assembly and growth of the bar in a low central density halo model.
  * Both galaxies exhibit a steady-state equilibrium phase where the bar is neither lengthening nor slowing. The steady-state equilibrium results from the balance of torque between particles that are gaining and losing angular momentum

* [The survey of Planetary Nebulae in Andromeda (M31): I. Imaging the disk and halo with MegaCam@CFHT](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.02597)
  * PNe were identified based on their bright OIII 5007 Å emission and absence of a continuum.
  * We identify 4289 PNe, of which only 1099 were previously known. By comparing the PN number density with the surface brightness profile of M31 out to ~30 kpc along the minor-axis, we find that the stellar population in the inner halo has a 7 times larger luminosity-specific PN number value than that of the disk
  * 关于PNLF：Interestingly, it shows a significant rise at the faint end, present in all radial bins covered by the survey, much steeper than that observed for the Magellanic clouds and Milky Way bulge. M31 shows two major episodes of star formation and the rise in the faint end of the PNLF is possibly associated with the older stellar population.

* [An ALMA survey of the SCUBA-2 Cosmology Legacy Survey UKIDSS/UDS field: Source catalogue and properties](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.02602)
  * AS2UDS, an 870-μm continuum survey with the Atacama Large Millimetre/sub-millimetre Array (ALMA) of 716 single-dish sub-millimetre sources detected in the UKIDSS/UDS field by the SCUBA-2 Cosmology Legacy Survey.
  * We detect 708 sub-millimetre galaxies (SMGs) at > 4.3σ significance
  * This large sample reveals a statistically significant trend of increasing sub-millimetre flux with redshift suggestive of galaxy downsizing.
  * we combine X-ray and mid-infrared active galaxy nuclei activity (AGN) indicators to yield a likely range for the AGN fraction of 8–28 % in our sample.

* [ALMA twenty-six arcmin2 survey of GOODS-S at one-millimeter (ASAGAO): Near-infrared-dark faint ALMA sources](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.02744)
  * 近红外dark的弱毫米波源：We report detections of two 1.2 mm continuum sources (S1.2mm ~ 0.6 mJy) without any counterparts in the deep H- and/or K-band image
  * One has a red IRAC (3.6 and 4.5 μm) counterpart, and the other has been independently detected at 850 and 870 μm using SCUBA2 and ALMA Band 7
  * Their optical to radio spectral energy distributions indicate that they can lie at z≳ 3-5 and can be in the early phase of massive galaxy formation
  * 对SFR密度的贡献：can be consistent with, or greater than that of bright submillimeter galaxies (S870μm> 4.2 mJy) at z ~ 3-5.

* [Pre-processing of galaxies in cosmic filaments around AMASCFI clusters in the CFHTLS](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.02879)
  * We detected cosmic filaments around galaxy clusters using photometric redshifts in the range 0.15 < z < 0.7.
  * The filament reconstruction was done with the DISPERSE al- gorithm in photometric redshift slices.
  * We showed that the AMASCFI cluster connectivity (i.e. the number of filaments connecting to a cluster) increases with cluster mass M200.
  * Passive galaxies in filaments are closer to clusters than star-forming galaxies in the low redshift bin only. The passive fraction of galaxies decreases with increasing clustercentric distance up to d ∼ 5 cMpc.

* [High density of active galactic nuclei in the outskirts of distant galaxy clusters](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.02919)
  * **Interesting**
  * 看Planck和SPT找到的z~1的最大质量的星系团的AGN分布
  * For our purposes, we computed the X-ray point-like source surface density in 0.5RYx500 wide annuli up to a clustercentric distance of 4RYx500
  * We found a significant excess of X-ray point sources between 2 and 2.5RYx500 at the 99.9\% confidence level
  * The results clearly display for the first time strong observational evidence of AGN triggering in the outskirts of high-redshift massive clusters with such a high statistical significance.

* [The SAMI Galaxy Survey: Bayesian Inference for Gas Disk Kinematics using a Hierarchical Gaussian Mixture Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.03121)
  * **Interesting, Useful**
  * Blobby3D, to infer gas kinematics that mitigates the effects of beam smearing for observations using Integral Field Spectroscopy (IFS)
  * Modelling the gas substructure within the disk is achieved by using a hierarchical Gaussian mixture model. 可以模拟气体团块和

* [WISDOM project - IV. A molecular gas dynamical measurement of the supermassive black hole mass in NGC 524](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.03124)
  * ALMA用分子气体盘测黑洞质量：This disc is shown to be dynamically relaxed, exhibiting ordered rotation about a compact 1.3 mm continuum source
  * There is a hole at the centre of the disc slightly larger than the SMBH sphere of influence. An azimuthal distortion of the observed velocity field is found to be due to either a position angle warp or radial gas flow
  * The uncertainties are dominated by the poorly constrained inclination and the stellar mass-to-light ratio of this galaxy

* [PRIMUS: Clustering of Star-forming and Quiescent Central Galaxies at 0.2<z<0.9](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.03127)
  * **Relevant**
  * present measurements of the clustering of isolated primary (IP) galaxies, used as a proxy for central galaxies, at 0.2 < z < 0.9 with data from the PRIMUS galaxy redshift survey.
  * We find that at fixed stellar mass, quiescent IP galaxies are more strongly clustered than star-forming IP galaxies at z ∼ 0.35 (10σ).
  * we find that these clustering differences are due in part to quiescent central galaxies being more strongly clustered than star-forming central galaxies. This is consistent with either distinct stellar-to-halo mass relations for quiescent and star-forming central galaxies, and/or central galaxy assembly bias

* [Discovery of a Lya emitting dark-cloud within z ~ 2.8 SMMJ02399-0136 system](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.03131)
  * We present Keck/KCWI integral field spectrograph observations of the complex system surrounding SMMJ02399−0136 (a lensed z=2.8 sub-mm galaxy), including an associated Lyα nebula, a dust- obscured, broad-absorption-line quasar, and neighboring galaxies.
  * The nebula exhibits a kinematic shear of ∼ 1000kms−1 over 100pkpc
  * We argue that this “dark cloud” is illuminated by the quasar with a UV flux that is orders of magnitude brighter than the emission along our sightline. This result confirms statistical inferences that luminous quasars at z > 2 emit UV radiation anisotropically.

* [Black hole mass and cluster mass correlation in cosmological hydro-dynamical simulations](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.03142)
  * In our simulations we find that MBH well correlates with M500 and T500, with the scatter around these relations compatible within 2σ with the scatter around MBH − MBCG at z = 0.
  * The MBH − M500 relation evolves with time, becoming shallower at lower redshift as a direct consequence of hierarchical structure formation

* [Powerful AGN jets and unbalanced cooling in the hot atmosphere of IC 4296](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.03198)
  * The galaxy hosts powerful radio jets piercing through the inner hot X-ray emitting atmosphere, depositing most of the energy into the ambient intra-cluster medium (ICM).
  * Whereas the radio surface brightness of the A configuration image is consistent with a Fanaroff-Riley Class I (FR I) system, the D configuration image reveals two large (∼ 160 kpc diameter), well-defined lobes
  * The jets are mildly curved, possibly re- brightened by the relative motion of the galaxy and the ICM, and terminate with sharp edges, suggesting the presence of bow shocks, which would classify this as a transitional state of a supersonic FRI radio source.
  * Because most of the energy of the jets is deposited far from the nucleus, the atmosphere of the galaxy continues to cool, apparently feeding the central supermassive black hole and powering the jet activity.

* [Spatially resolved carbon and oxygen isotopic ratios in NGC 253 using optically thin tracers](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.03244)
  * Spatially resolve the carbon and oxygen isotope ratios across the central molecular zone (full size ~∼600 pc) in the nearby starburst galaxy NGC 253
  * First extragalactic detection of the double isotopologue 13C18O
  * The molecular clouds in the central region of NGC 253 show similar rare isotope enrichment to those within the central molecular zone of the Milky way.
  * This enrichment is attributed to stellar nucleosynthesis. Measured isotopic ratios suggest an enhancement of 18O as compared to our Galactic center, which we attribute to an extra 18O injection from massive stars.
  * We observe an extra molecular component of highly processed gas on top of the already proposed less processed gas being transported to the central region of NGC 253. Such multicomponent nature and optical depth effects may hinder the use of isotopic ratios based on spatially unresolved line to infer the star formation history and/or initial stellar mass function properties in the nuclei of galaxies.

* [Do Galaxy Morphologies Really Affect the Efficiency of Star Formation during the Phase of Galaxy Transition?](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.03505)
  * **Interesting**
  * we discuss the net effect of galaxy morphologies on the star formation efficiency (SFE) during the phase of galaxy transition, on the basis of our CO(J = 1 − 0) observations of 28 local “green-valley” galaxies with the Nobeyama 45m Radio Telescope.
  * We observed 13 “disk-dominated” and 15 “bulge-dominated” green-valley galaxies at fixed stellar mass (M∗) and star formation rate (SFR)
  * we reveal that the distributions of molecular gas mass, molecular gas fraction, and SFE of green-valley galaxies do not change with their morphologies, suggesting little impact of galaxy morphologies on their SFE
  * On the other hand, we find that ∼20% of bulge-dominated green-valley galax- ies do not show significant CO emission line, showing high SFEs for their M∗ and SFR. These molecular gas deficient sources identified only in the bulge-dominated green-valley galaxies may represent an important population during the quenching phase under the influence of stellar bulge,
  * our results suggest that the presence of stellar bulge does not decrease the efficiency of on-going star formation, in contrast to the prediction of the morphological quenching scenario.

* [Efficient Selection of Quasar Candidates Based on Optical and Infrared Photometric Data Using Machine Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.03337)
  * Exploring the distribution of quasars and stars in the color spaces, we find that the combination of infrared and optical photometry is more con- ducive to select quasar candidates.
  * Two new color criterions (yW1W2 and izW1W2) are constructed to distinguish quasars from stars efficiently.
  * we put forward an efficient schema to select quasar candidates and high redshift quasar candidates, in which two machine learning algorithms (XGBoost and SVM) are implemented
  * For these newly predicted quasar candidates, a regressor is constructed to estimate their redshifts
  * XGBoost (Chen & Guestrin 2016) is a boosting algorithm that can be used for classification and regression problems.

* [On the Origin of the Scatter in the Red Sequence: An Analysis of Four CLASH Clusters](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.03618)
  * **Interesting, Relevant**
  * In four CLASH clusters at z = 0.355 ± 0.007, we find that the optical-IR galaxy colors confirm the previously known trend of metallicity along the red sequence but also show a strong connection between stellar age and red sequence offset, with ages ranging from 3 to 8 Gyr.
  * While we will extend this analysis to the full CLASH sample, in four clusters our technique already provides a color precision in near-total-light apertures to resolve the spread in stellar population formation ages that drives the scatter in the red sequence.

* [On the origin of star-gas counterrotation in low-mass galaxies](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.03627)
  * Illustris模拟里看逆向旋转的恒星和气体盘：Only ∼1% of our sample shows a counterrotating gaseous disk at z=0. These counterrotating disks arise in galaxies that have had a significant episode of gas removal followed by the acquisition of new gas with misaligned angular momentum.
  * In our simulations, we identify two main channels responsible for the gas loss: a strong feedback burst and gas stripping during a fly-by passage through a more massive group environment.

* [The role of gas fragmentation during the formation of supermassive black holes](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.03637)
  * hydrodynamic simulations to study the effect of fragmentation on the SMBH seed mass in the direct collapse formation scenario
  * Our simulations in low-spin halos, in the presence of a strong UV background are consistent with the Direct Collapse Black Hole model
  * While in our simulations under the presence of a low UV background, we find fragmentation and the formation of various minor seeds. 10^3-10^4 Msun的seed，如果能并合还是很显著的

  * A Spectroscopic Census of X-ray Systems in the COSMOS Field
  * The COSMOS X-ray system catalog we use (George et al. 2011) includes 180 X-ray systems
  * We identify 1843 spectroscopic redshifts of member candidates in these X-ray systems. The X-ray luminosity (LX) - velocity dispersion (σv) scaling relation of the COSMOS X-ray systems is consistent with that of massive X-ray clusters.

  * A 25 deg2 region, including the M81 complex (M81, M82, NGC 3077), NGC 2976 and IC2574, was mapped during ~3000 hours with the DRAO synthesis telescope. With a physical resolution of ~1 kpc
  * This supports the assumption that intergalactic gas and galaxies in the system participate to a large-scale ordered rotation motion which is dominated by M81.

* [Testing the rotation versus merger scenario in the galaxy cluster Abell 2107](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.03858)
  * Search for global rotation of the intracluster medium (ICM) in the galaxy cluster Abell 2107
  * By fitting the centroid of the iron Kα line complex at 6.7–6.9 keV rest frame in Chandra ACIS-I spectra, we identify the possible rotation axis
  * A more conservative interpretation may be provided by an unnoticed off-center, head-on collision between two comparable halos. Our analysis confirms the peculiar dynamical nature of the otherwise regular cluster Abell 2107, but is not able to resolve the rotation vs merger scenario,

* [High- and Low-α Disk Stars Separate Dynamically at all Ages](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.04030)
  * **Interesting**
  * We find that \emph{at all ages}, the high- and low-α sequences are dynamically distinct. This implies separate formation and evolutionary histories for the two sequences; a star's membership in the high- or low-α sequence indicates its dynamical properties at a given time.

* [C IV absorbers tracing cool gas in dense galaxy group/cluster environments](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.04119)
  * 三个很近的QSO视线方向上的HI-CIV吸收系统： The ionization models are consistent with the origin of metal lines and H I from a cool and diffuse photoionized gas phase with T≲4×104 K and nH≲5×10−4 cm−3
  * The RXJ~1230.8+0115 sightline traces the outskirt regions of the Virgo cluster where the absorber is found to have super-solar metallicity.
  * The detection of metal lines along with H I has enabled us to confirm the presence of cool, diffuse gas possibly enriched by outflows and tidal interactions in environments with significant galaxy density.

  * **Relevant**
  * At such faint levels the structure of NGC 1533 appear amazingly disturbed with clear structural asymmetry between inner and outer isophotes in the North-East direction.
  * We detect new spiral arm-like tails in the outskirts, which might likely be the signature of a past interaction/merging event. Similarly, IC 2038 and IC 2039 show tails and distortions indicative of their ongoing interaction.

  * Using a new multi-resolution algorithm, we have created a catalog of 2875 sources, including 675 with well-determined spectral indices. We detect sources at the position of 319 of the X-ray sources in the Tuellmann et al. (2011) Chandra survey of M33, the majority of which are likely to be background galaxies.
  * we detect 155 of the 217 optical supernova remnants included in the lists of Long et al. (2010) and Lee & Lee (2014), making this by far the largest sample of remnants at known distances with multiwavelength coverage

* [How AGN feedback drives the size growth of the first quasars](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.04544)
  * **Interersting**
  * Using a set of cosmological ‘zoom-in’ hydrodynamic simulations performed with the moving mesh code Arepo, we show that z = 6 quasar host galaxies develop extremely tightly bound stellar bulges with peak circular velocities 300 − 500 km s−1 and half-mass radii ≈ 0.5 kpc.
  * Despite their high binding energy, we find that these compact bulges expand at z < 6, with their half-mass radii reaching ≈ 5 kpc by z = 3
  * By tracking individual stellar populations, we find that the gradual expansion of the stellar component is mainly driven by fluctuations in the gravitational potential induced by bursty AGN feedback.
  * We also find that galaxy size growth and the development of a cored stellar profile does not occur if AGN feedback is ineffective.

* [Gemini IFU, VLA, and HST observation of the OH Megamaser Galaxy IRAS17526+3253](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.04729)
  * The HST images clearly reveal a mid-to-advanced stage major merger whose northwestern and southeastern nuclei have a projected separation of ∼8.5kpc.
  * The GMOS/IFU data reveal two structures in north-western separated by 850 pc and by a discontinuity in the velocity field of ∼200 km s−1. We associate the blue-shifted and red-shifted components with, respectively, the distorted disk of northwestern and tidal debris

* [Black Hole Mass Scaling Relations for Early-Type Galaxies: MBH-M∗,sph and MBH-M∗,gal](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.04738)
  * However, and importantly, we discover that the ES/S0-type galaxies with disks are offset from the E-type galaxies by more than a factor of ten in their MBH/M∗,sph ratio, with ramifications for formation theories, simulations, and some virial factor measurements used to convert AGN virial masses into MBH 就是说S0的关系更陡
  * For MBH > 10^7M⊙, we detect no significant bend nor offset in either the MBH–M∗,sph or MBH–M∗,gal relations due to barred versus non-barred, or core-Sersic versus Śersic, early-type galaxies
  * We report the discovery of a local, compact massive spheroid in NGC 5252.

* [Angular momentum of z∼1.5 galaxies and their local analogues with adaptive optics](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.04746)
  * DYNAMO analogues of high-z galaxies have low j∗ for their stellar mass M∗, and low bulge-to-total light ratio β for their j∗/M∗.
  * The high-z galaxy COSMOS 127977 has j∗/M∗ consistent with normal local disk galaxies, while UDS 78317 is consistent with local analogues. However, our high-resolution OSIRIS data reveal that UDS 78317 may be a merging system.
  * Much of the scatter in M∗ − j∗ that is not explained by variations in the bulge-to-total ratio or evolution with redshift may be driven by increased turbulence due to star formation, or by treating mergers as rotating disks.

* [Spotting the differences between active and non-active twin galaxies on kpc-scales. A pilot study](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.04818)
  * To do so, we compare the properties of two isolated nearby active galaxies and their non-active twins selected from the Calar Alto Legacy Integral Field Area (CALIFA) survey. This pilot sample includes two barred and two unbarred galaxies.
  * We find that the analysed active galaxies present lopsided disks and higher values of the global stellar angular momentum (λR) than their non-active twins.
  * The inflow of gas could have been produced by a twisted disk instability in the case of the unbarred AGN, and by the bar in the case of the barred AGN.

* [Morphology-assisted galaxy mass-to-light predictions using deep learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.05091)
  * **Useful**
  * We want to investigate the possibility of using morphology information to assist predictions of M/L. Our first goal is to develop and train a method that only requires a g-band image and redshift as input
  * We used a machine learning pipeline that can be split in two steps. First, we detected morphology features with a convolutional neural network. These are then combined with redshift, pixel size and g-band luminosity features in a gradient boosting machine.
  * Morphology is a useful attribute when no colour information is available, but can not outperform colour methods on its own. When we combine the morphology features with global g- and i-band luminosities, we find an improved estimate compared to a model which does not make use of morphology.

* [Strong lensing models of eight CLASH clusters from extensive spectroscopy: accurate total mass reconstructions in the cores](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.05103)
  * Different models are tested in each cluster depending on the complexity of its mass distribution and on the number of detected multiple images. Four clusters show more than five spectroscopically confirmed multiple image families
  * We present spectroscopic confirmation of 27 multiply lensed sources, with no previous spectroscopic measurements, spanning over the redshift range of zsrc=[0.7−6.1]. Moreover, we confirm an average of 48 galaxy members in the core of each cluster, thanks to the high efficiency and large field of view of MUSE.
  * The projected total mass and mass density profiles of all clusters have very similar shapes, when rescaled by independent measurements of M200c and R200c.
  * Specifically, we measure the mean value of the projected total mass of our cluster sample within 10 (20)% of R200c to be 0.13 (0.32) of M200c, with a remarkably small scatter of 5 (6)%.

* [From 'bathtub' galaxy evolution models to metallicity gradients](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.05105)
  * 1-D chemical evolution formalism: We fit analytical models against the metallicity radial profiles of low-redshift star-forming galaxies in the mass range log(M⋆/M⊙) = [9.0-11.0]
  * we take into account inside-out disc growth and add physically-motivated prescriptions for radial gradients in star formation efficiency (SFE).
  * The parameters describing the disc assembly timescale are not strongly constrained from the metallicity profiles, while useful constrains are obtained for the SFE (and its radial dependence) and the outflow loading factor.
  * The inferred outflow loading factor is found to decrease with stellar mass, going from nearly unity at log(M⋆/M⊙) = 9.0 to close to zero at log(M⋆/M⊙) = 11.0

* [A Compact Jet at the Infrared Heart of the Prototypical Low-Luminosity AGN in NGC 1052](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.05108)
  * NGC1052一直到0.5 pc上都不能被分解开，可能来自于compact jet: This is in line with non-thermal emission from a compact jet, a scenario further supported by a number of evidences: the broken power-law shape of the continuum distribution in the radio-to-UV range; the ∼4% degree of polarisation measured in the nuclear mid-IR continuum, together with the mild optical extinction (AV∼1mag); and the "harder when brighter" behaviour of the X-ray spectrum, indicative of self-Compton synchrotron radiation.
  * A remarkable feature is the steepness of the IR-to-UV core continuum, characterised by a power-law index of ∼2.6, as compared to the canonical value of 0.7.
  * The case of NGC 1052 shows that compact jets can dominate the nuclear emission in LLAGN across the whole electromagnetic spectrum, a scenario that might be common among this class of active nuclei.

* [A Universal Relation of Dust Obscuration Across Cosmic Time](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.05121)
  * 用红外超研究星系的dust obscuration特性: We show that IRX generally correlates with stellar mass (M∗), star formation rate (SFR), gas-phase metallicity (Z), infrared luminosity (LIR) and the half-light radius (Re). A weak correlation of IRX with axial ratio (b/a) is driven by the inclination and thus seen as a projection effect.
  * We find that SFGs obey an empirical relation of the form IRX=10^α(LIR)^β Re^{-gamma}(b/a)^{−δ} where the power-law indices all increase with metallicity. The best-fitting relation yields a scatter of ∼0.17dex and no dependence on stellar mass.
  * Moreover, this empirical relation also holds for distant SFGs out to z=3 in a population-averaged sense, suggesting it to be universal over cosmic time.

* [The Dynamics and Distribution of Angular Momentum in HiZELS Star-Forming Galaxies at z = 0.8 - 3.3](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.05148)
  * **Interesting**
  * AO-IFU观测：34 star-forming galaxies at z = 0.8-3.3 selected from the HiZELS narrow-band survey
  * We measure the kinematics of the ionised interstellar medium on ∼1 kpc scales, and show that the galaxies are turbulent, with a median ratio of rotational to dispersion support of v/σ=0.82±0.13.
  * 结合高分辨率rest frame光学图像做旋转曲线研究: 在高红移，恒星形成的质量和单位角动量的关系依然存在
  * 角动量并不随着质量增长而在中心升高：Although the stellar mass of a typical star-forming galaxy is expected to grow by a factor ∼8 in the ∼5 Gyrs between z∼3.3 and z∼0.8, we show that the internal distribution of angular momentum becomes less centrally concentrated in this period i.e the angular momentum grows outwards.
  * 在EAGLE模拟中也存在类似现象: This change is attributed to a combination of gas accretion in the outer disk, and feedback that preferentially arises from the central regions of the galaxy.

* [On the Assembly Bias of Cool Core Clusters Traced by Hα Nebulae](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.05092)
  * **Relevant, Important, Interesting**
  * We make novel use of Hα emission lines in the central galaxies of redMaPPer clusters as proxies to construct large (1,000's) samples of CC and NCC clusters, and measure their relative assembly bias using both clustering and weak lensing
  * Our cross-correlations can constrain assembly bias up to a statistical uncertainty of 6%.
  * Given our Hα criteria for CC and NCC, we find no significant differences in their clustering amplitude. Interpreting this difference as the absence of halo assembly bias, our results rule out the possibility of having different large-scale (tens of Mpc) environments as the source of diversity observed in cluster cores.
  * This would suggest that either the cooling properties of the cluster core are determined early on solely by the local (<200 kpc) gas properties at formation or that local merging leads to stochastic CC relaxation and disruption in a periodic way, preserving the average population properties over time.

* [Study of gravitational fields and globular cluster systems of early-type galaxies](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.05659)
  * **Interesting**
  * We employed Jeans analysis of radial velocities of globular clusters (GCs). We analysed nearly all ETGs having more than about 100 archival GC radial velocity measurements available.
  * Successful ΛCDM fits are found for all galaxies, but compared to the theoretical HMCR and SHMR, the best-fit halos usually have concentrations that are too low and stellar masses that are too high for their masses.
  * Most galaxies can be fitted by the MOND models successfully as well, but for some of the galaxies, especially those in centers of galaxy clusters, the observed GCs velocity dispersions are too high
  * Additionally, we find many signs that the GC systems were perturbed by galaxy interactions.

* [The lifetime of binary black holes in Sérsic galaxy models](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.05682)
  * In this paper, we infer upper limits on the lifetime of binary black holes of 10^{5-6} Msun and up to 10^8 M , forming in galaxy mergers, exploring two underlying stellar density profiles, by Dehnen and by Prugniel & Simien
  * We find that di↵erent stellar profiles predict very distinct trends with binary mass, with lifetimes ranging between fractions of a Gyr to more than 10 Gyr, and with a spread of about one order of magnitude
  * Low-mass black hole binaries of 10^5 M develop larger eccentricities as they experience a longer-lasting interaction with the stellar background that help reduce their lifetimes during this phase.
    * As black hole coalescences of 10^{4-7} Msun can be detected with LISA from redshift z~0 up to z ~ 15–20, when seed black holes form

* [The XMM-Newton/HST view of the obscuring outflow in the Seyfert Galaxy Mrk 335 observed at extremely low X-ray flux](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.05795)
  * A simultaneous new campaign by XMM-Newton and HST caught the source at an historical low flux in the X-ray band. The soft X-ray spectrum is dominated by prominent emission features, and by the effect of a strong ionized absorber
  * The resulting picture from this latest multi-wavelength campaign confirms that Mrk 335 undergoes the effect of a patchy, medium-velocity outflowing gas in a wide range of ionization states that seem to be persistently obscuring the nuclear continuum.

* [A discovery of young radio sources in the cores of giant radio galaxies selected at hard X-rays](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.05922)
  * Giant Radio Galaxies (GRG) are the largest single entities in the Universe, having a projected linear size exceeding 0.7 Mpc, which implies that they are also quite old objects. 只占大射电星系的6%
  * X-ray挑选的射电星系中GRG的比例比射电挑选的要高得多
  * We present radio observations of 15 nuclei of hard X-ray selected GRG, finding for the first time a large fraction (61%) of young radio sources at the center of Mpc-scale structures.

* [Old and young stellar populations in DustPedia galaxies and their role in dust heating](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.05933)
  * 814 galaxies from DustPedia: We take advantage of the widely used galaxy SED fitting code CIGALE, properly adapted to include the state-of-the-art dust model THEMIS.
  * We find a mild correlation between the mass fraction of the small a-C(:H) grains with the specific star-formation rate. On average, young stars are very efficient in heating the dust, with absorption fractions reaching as high as ∼ 77% of the total, unattenuated luminosity of this population
  * Dust heating in early-type galaxies is mainly due to old stars, up to a level of ∼ 90%. Young stars progressively contribute more for ‘typical’ spiral galaxies and they become the dominant source of dust heating for Sm type and irregular galaxies, donating up to ∼ 60% of their luminosity to this purpose.

* [Is the stellar mass-stellar metallicity relation universal in the Milky Way satellites and beyond?](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.06054)
  * (1) The exponents (α) for the MZRs of the satellites in halos with the same mass as the Milky Way halo but different individual assembly histories are mostly ∼0.2–0.4, i.e., having a scatter of ∼ 0.2; and the scatter of α increases with decreasing halo masses.
  * (2) The MZR relations are changed little by the variation of halo masses and the classification between central galaxies and satellites, if many halos with the same mass are stacked together.
  * A double power law exists in the MZR relations for both central galaxies and stacked satellites

* [Discovery of Highly Blueshifted Broad Balmer and Metastable Helium Absorption Lines in a Tidal Disruption Event](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.05637)
  * We report the discovery of non-stellar hydrogen Balmer and metastable helium absorption lines accompanying a transient, high-velocity (0.05c) broad absorption line (BAL) system in the optical spectra of the tidal disruption event (TDE) AT2018zr (z = 0.071).
  * We conclude that these transient absorption features are more likely to arise in fast outflows produced by the TDE than absorbed by the unbound debris.
  * In accordance with the outflow picture, we are able to reproduce the flat-topped H↵ emission in a spherically expanding medium, without invoking the typical prescription of an ellipticaldisk
  * This suggests that outflows may be ubiquitous among TDEs and may be less sensitive to viewing angle effects compared to QSO outflows.
    * TDE中的外流很常见，高速低速都有，射电波段也有

* [Simulating the effect of photoheating feedback during reionization](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.06167)
  * 用AREPO-RT模拟再电离过程：We examine how photoheating feedback, due to the reionization process, shapes the properties of galaxies
  * Contrary to previous works, photoheating suppresses star formation rates by larger than 50% only in halos less massive than ∼ 10^8.4 M (∼ 10^8.8 M) at z = 6 (z = 5).
  * 不能简单假定均匀的UV背景：By assuming a uniform UV background instead of self- consistently modelling the patchiness of reionization yields an earlier onset of suppression of star formation, indicating that such an approximation acts like an early reionization model.
  * 只有光致加热是不够的：photoheating alone is only able to quench halos less massive than ∼ 109 M⊙ at z~5, implying that photoheating feedback plays a sub-dominant role in regulating star formation compared to stellar feedback
  * Most importantly, photoheating does not generate any observable flattening in the faint end slope of the UV luminosity function up to M1500 = −15 mag or in the low-mass end of the stellar mass function
  * We also do not observe a dip in the cosmic star formation rate density caused by reionization.

* [The effect of rotation on the thermal instability of stratified galactic atmospheres - I. Local analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.06172)
  * (i) multiple gas phases can coexist in the atmospheres of galaxies and clusters; (ii) these atmospheres may be significantly rotating in the inner parts, with typical velocities that approach or even exceed the local sound speed.
  * 热不稳定性可能是在热气体中形成冷气体结构的可能渠道之一: We find that the formation of cold structures starting from small isobaric perturbations is enhanced in the regions where the rotation of the system is dynamically important
  * In particular, the threshold value of the ratio between the cooling and dynamical time tcool/tdyn below which condensations can form is increased by a factor up to ∼ 10 in the presence of significant rotation.
    * However, recent ALMA observations of a sample of 15 clusters showed that in 2 cases (Abell 262 and Hydra-A) the molecular gas has settled into a rotating disc (Olivares et al. 2019; Russell et al. 2019).
    * Also note that in some clusters the rotation pattern may be hidden because the system is viewed face on, as suggested in the case of Abell 1835 by McNamara et al. (2014).

* [The effect of rotation on the thermal instability of stratified galactic atmospheres - II. The formation of High Velocity Clouds](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.06178)
  * We do this by studying the evolution of the models of rotating galactic coronae presented in Sormani et al. (2018) under the presence of cooling and thermal conduction.
  * We combine a linear stability analysis with the results of local and global hydrodynamical simulations. We find that condensations are likely to occur in regions where the corona has substantial rotational support
  * We conclude that HVCs can form by thermal instabilities provided that (i) the corona is rotating substantially in the inner (R< 50 kpc) parts, as suggested by current observational data and predicted by cosmological simulations of galaxy formation; (ii) close to the disc the corona is well-represented by a nearly-equilibrium stratified rotating structure (as opposed to a fast cooling flow).

* [Cool circumgalactic gas of passive galaxies from cosmological inflow](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.06182)
  * **Interesting**
  * Using semi-analytical parametric models, we describe the cool CGM around massive, low-redshift ETGs as the cosmological accretion of gas into their dark matter halos, resulting in an inflow of clouds from the external parts of the halos to the central galaxies.
  * We find that inflow models can successfully reproduce the observed kinematics, the number of absorbers and the column densities of the cool gas
  * We conclude that the cool gas present in the halos of ETGs likely cannot reach the central regions and feed the galaxy star formation, thus explaining why these passive objects are no longer forming stars.

* [Non-equilibrium Ionization States Within Galactic Outflows: Explaining Their O VI and N V Column Densities](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.06183)
  * 一维球对称外流模拟：We track the ionization state of the outflowing gas with a non-equilibrium atomic chemistry network that includes photoionization, photo-heating, and ion-by-ion cooling.
  * 光致电离平衡的假设不能用：We find that for a large range of parameter choices, the ionization state of the material departs strongly from what it would be in photo-ionization equilibrium, in conflict with what is commonly assumed in the analysis of observations.
  * Nearly all the models reproduce the low N V to O VI column density ratios and the relatively high O VI column densities that are observed.

* [Lyα emission from galaxies in the Epoch of Reionization](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.06185)
  * we combine state-of-the-art hydrodynamical simulations of “Althæa”, a prototypical Lyman Break Galaxy (LBG, stellar mass M⋆ ≃ 10^10M⊙) at z = 7.2, with detailed radiative transfer computations of dust/continuum, [C II]158 μm, and Lyα to clarify the relation between the galaxy properties and its Lyα emission
  * Lya逃逸比例和EW都低：The correlation between escape fraction and inclination is weak, as a result of the rather chaotic structure of high-redshift galaxies
  * The high attenuation is primarily caused by dust clumps co-located with young stellar clusters. We can turn Althæa into a Lyman Alpha Emitter (LAE) only if we artificially remove dust from the clumps

* [A metal-poor damped Ly-alpha system at redshift 6.4](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.06186)
  * We identify a strong Lyα damping wing profile in the spectrum of the quasar P183+05 at z = 6.4386. Given the detection of several narrow metal absorption lines at z = 6.40392, the most likely explanation for the absorption profile is that it is due to a damped Lyα system.
  * 最远的DLA探测：in order to match the data a contribution of an intergalactic medium 5 − 40% neutral or additional weaker absorbers near the quasar is also required.
  * 没有Pop III增丰过的迹象：This object is among the most metal-poor damped Lyα systems known and even though it is observed only ∼850 Myr after the Big Bang, its relative abundances do not show signatures of chemical enrichment by Population III stars.

* [Uncertainties in gas kinematics arising from stellar continuum modelling in integral field spectroscopy data: the case of NGC2906 observed with MUSE/VLT](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.06252)
  * We study how the use of several stellar subtraction methods and line fitting approaches can affect the derivation of the main kinematic parameters
  * We compare three different methods to subtract the stellar continuum (FIT3D, STARLIGHT and pPXF), combined with one of the following stellar libraries: MILES, STELIB and GRANADA+MILES.
  * The choice of the stellar subtraction method is the most important ingredient affecting the derivation of the gas kinematics, followed by the choice of the stellar library and by the line fitting approach.
  * The results obtained from the [NII] line seem to be slightly more robust, as it is less affected by stellar absorption than Hα

* [Dual-Component Plasma Lens Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.06384)
  * Diverging frequency-dependent lensing occurs from refraction due to a distribution of over-dense axisymmetric plasma along an observer’s line of sight. Such plasma lenses are particularly interesting from the point of view of astronomical observations because they can both magnify and dim the appearance of background sources as a function of frequency.
  * Plasma lensing is believed to be involved in a number of separate phenomena involving the scintillation of radio pulsars, extreme scattering events of background radio sources and may also play a role in the generation of fast radio bursts.
  * Similar to binary gravitational lens models, these dual component plasma lenses feature a rich and complex critical and caustic morphology, as well as generate more complicated light curves.

* [SHALOS: Statistical Herschel-ATLAS Lensed Objects Selection](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.06424)
  * 挑选被强引力透镜放大的星系：we propose a new methodology with a statistical selection approach in order to increase by a factor of ∼ 5 the number of such events.
  * The proposed methodology is based on the Bhattacharyya distance as a measure of the similarity between probability distributions of properties of two different cross-matched galaxies.
  * It combines the information of four different properties of the pair of galaxies: angular separation, luminosity percentile, redshift and optical/sub-mm flux density ratio.
  * The SHALOS method provided a ranked list of strongly lensed galaxies.
    * In statistics, the Bhattacharyya distance (Bhattacharyya 1943) measures the sim- ilarity of two discrete or continuous probability distributions. It is closely related to the Bhattacharyya coefficient (BC; Bhat- tacharyya 1943), i.e. the overlap estimate of two probability distributions.

* [Gravitationally Lensed Quasar SDSS J1442+4055: Redshifts of Lensing Galaxies, Time Delay, Microlensing Variability, and Intervening Metal System at z ~ 2](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.06505)
  * We determine the redshift of two bright galaxies around the doubly imaged quasar using LT spectroscopy, while GTC data lead to low–noise individual spectra of A, B, and the main lensing galaxy G1.
  * Additionally, the quasar spectra show absorption by metal–rich gas at z ∼ 2. This dusty absorber is responsible for an extinction bump at a rest–frame wavelength of 2209 ± 2  ̊A, which has strengths of ∼ 0.47 and 0.76 mag μm−1 for A and B

* [Probing hot gas around luminous red galaxies through the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.06654)
  **Interesting**
  * We construct the mean thermal Sunyaev-Zel’dovich (tSZ) Comptonization y profile around Luminous Red Galaxies (LRGs) in the redshift range 0.16 < z < 0.47 利用Planck
  * We compare the measured profile with predictions from the cosmo- OWLS suite of cosmological hydrodynamical simulations. This comparison agrees well for models that include feedback from active galactic nuclei (AGN)
  * We also compare our results with predictions based on the halo model with a universal pressure profile (UPP) giving the y signal. The predicted profile is consistent with the data, but only if we account for the clustering of haloes via a two-halo term and if halo masses are estimated using the mean stellar-to-halo mass (SHM) relation
  * SHMR的scatter对模型预测很重要
    * Planck Collaboration et al. (2013b) detected the tSZ signal from low-mass haloes as low as Mh ∼ 2 × 10^13M⊙ by stacking the Planck tSZ map around locally brightest galaxies (LBGs) con- structed from SDSS DR7 galaxies. Vikram et al. (2017) and Hill et al. (2018) cross-correlated the Planck tSZ map with the SDSS DR4 and DR7 group catalogue from Yang et al. (2007)
