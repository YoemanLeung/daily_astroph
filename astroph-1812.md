## Dec 2:

#### [CHILES: HI morphology and galaxy environment at z=0.12 and z=0.17](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.12405)
    * We focus on two redshift ranges between 0.108 ≤ z ≤ 0.127 and 0.162 ≤ z ≤ 0.183 which are among the worst affected by radio frequency interference (RFI).
    * We report on our in-depth testing of an automated spectral line source finder to pro- duce H i total intensity maps which we present side-by-side with significance maps to evaluate the reliability of the morphology recovered by the source finder.
    * Many of the detections show disturbed H i morphologies suggesting they have undergone a recent interaction which is not evi- dent from deep optical imaging alone.


#### [The Impact of Enhanced Halo Resolution on the Simulated Circumgalactic Medium](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.12410)
    * We introduce the technique of Enhanced Halo Resolution (EHR), enabling more realistic physical modeling of the simulated CGM by consistently forcing gas refinement to smaller scales throughout the virial halo of a simulated galaxy.
    * EHR (1) changes the thermal balance of the CGM, increasing its cool gas content and decreasing its warm/hot gas content; (2) preserves cool gas structures for longer periods; and (3) enables these cool clouds to exist at progressively smaller size scales.


#### [Star formation and gas in the minor merger UGC 10214](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.12417)
    * The comparison of the molecular gas mass and current SFR gives a molecular gas depletion time of about ∼ 2 Gyr (based on Hα), comparable to those of normal spiral galaxies.
    * we find that the SFR has increased by a factor of about 2-3 during the recent past.
    * The atomic and molecular gas distribution is asymmetric, but the position-velocity diagram along the major axis shows a pattern of regular rotation.


#### [Candidate Massive Galaxies at z∼4 in the Dark Energy Survey](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.12422)
    - **Relevant**
    * Using stellar population models, we predicted that the Dark Energy Survey (DES) - due to its special combination of area (5000 deg.sq.) and depth (i = 24.3) - would be in the position to detect massive (  10^11 M⊙) galaxies at z ∼ 4.
    * We finally select 233 candidates whose photometric redshift probability distribution function peaks around z ∼ 4, have high stellar masses (log(M∗/M⊙) ∼ 11.7 for a Salpeter IMF) and ages around 0.1 Gyr

#### [Subhalo destruction in the Apostle and Auriga simulations](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.12437)
    * We introduce a new method for tracking the orbits of subhalos between simulation snapshots that gives accurate results down to a few kiloparsecs from the centre of the halo.
    * Relative to a dark matter-only simulation, the abundance of subhalos in Apostle is reduced by 50% near the centre and by 10% within the virial radius.
    * The velocity distributions of subhalos are also affected by the presence of the galaxy, much more so in Auriga than in Apostle.

#### [Radiative Stellar Feedback in Galaxy Formation: Methods and Physics](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.12437)
    * We study dwarf through Milky Way masses, and explore RHD effects including H/He photoionization; photoelectric, Lyman Werner, Compton, thermal dust heating; single and multiple-scattering radiation pressure (RP).
    * In all cases, the dominant RFB channels on galaxy scales are photoionization heating and single-scattering RP.
    * At all masses, most of the ionizing/FUV luminosity from young stars (~half bolometric) is absorbed. In dwarfs, the strongest effect is photoionization heating from the meta-galactic background, suppressing accretion onto galaxies.


#### [Broad absorption line disappearance/emergence in multiple ions in a weak emission-line quasar](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.12483)
    * We report the discovery of disappearance of Mg ii, Al iii, C iv, and Si iv broad absorption lines (BALs) at the same velocity, accompanied by a new Civ BAL emerging at a higher velocity, in the quasar J0827+4252 at z = 2.038.
    * The simultaneous Civ BAL disappearance and emergence at different velocities, together with no variations in the CRTS light curve, indicate that ionization changes in the absorbing material are unlikely to cause the observed BAL variability.

#### [No evidence for enhanced [OIII] 88um emission in a z~6 quasar compared to its companion starbursting galaxy](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.12836)
    * We present ALMA band 8 observations of the [O III] 88μm line and the underlying thermal infrared continuum emission in the z=6.08 quasar CFHQS J2100–1715
    * 两个系统，一个有QSO，一个没有，比较ISM
    * Bright [OIII] 88μm emission from ionized gas is detected in both systems; the positions and line–widths are consistent with earlier [CII] measurements, indicating that both lines trace the same gravitational potential on galactic scales.
    * This suggests that gas ionization by the quasar (expected to lead to strong optical [O III] 5008  ̊A emission) does not dominantly determine the quasar’s FIR [O III] 88μm luminosity.


#### [Major Mergers between Dark Matter Haloes -- I: Predictions for Size, Shape and Spin](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.12839)
    - **Relevant**
    * We have performed a large set of simulations of binary mergers between isolated, truncated halos with various density profiles, to map out the relationship between the initial conditions and merger parameters and the structure of the final remnant
    * The outcomes of mergers are most easily understood in terms of a scaled dimensionless energy parameter κ and an angular momentum (or spin) parameter λ.
    * We find that the axis ratio c/a scales roughly linearly with energy κ, while the axis ratio b/a scales linearly with spin λ
    * Qualitatively, mergers on radial orbits produce prolate remnants, while mergers on tangential orbits produce oblate remnants.


#### [Major Mergers between Dark Matter Haloes -- II: Profile and Concentration Changes](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.12844)
    * The remnants typically have higher densities than the ini- tial conditions, but differ only slightly from self-similar scaling predictions.
    * As expected, energetic encounters produce more extended remnants while mergers of strongly bound systems produce compact rem- nants.
    * the scale radius of the density profile shows the opposite trend; increasing in the remnants of low-energy encounters relative to energetic ones. Even in the most energetic encounters, the density within the scale radius decreases only slightly (by 10–20%), while for very low-energy systems it increases significantly after the merger.


#### [Sub-percent Photometry: Faint DA White Dwarf Spectrophotometric Standards for Astrophysical Observatories](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.12534)
    - **Beautiful, Useful**
    * We have established a network of 19 faint (16.5 mag < V <19 mag) northern and equatorial DA white dwarfs as spectrophotometric standards for present and future wide-field observatories
    * The excellent agreement between observations and models validates the use of non-local- thermodynamic-equilibrium (NLTE) DA white dwarf atmospheres extinguished by interstellar dust as accurate spectrophotometric references.

## Dec 3:

#### [Low star formation efficiency in typical galaxies at z=5-6](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.00006)
    * We report the detection of CO(2–1) line emission from a Lyman Break Galaxy at z ∼ 5.7 with the VLA. The CO line luminosity implies a massive molecular gas reservoir
    * 分子气体贮藏质量大，SF效率比很多z>5的星暴星系都低，很z>3的MS星系差不多
    * We also obtain a deep CO upper limit for a Main Sequence galaxy at z ∼ 5.3 with ∼ 3 times lower SFR, perhaps implying a high αCO conversion factor, as typically found in low metallicity galaxies.
    * 其他星系观测的上限指出了alpha_CO值较高，结合看到[NII] 205micron弱发射线，说明z=5-6的普通星系里面辐射强较硬，ISM金属丰度可能比较低
    * Our sample shows evidence for high dust temperatures, and a young starburst producing high radiation intensity and hardness even with substantial dust obscuration


#### [A systematic analysis of star cluster disruption by tidal shocks -- I. Controlled N-body simulations and a new theoretical model](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.00014)
    * We find that the strength of the shock and the density of the cluster within the half-mass radius are the dominant properties that drive the amount of mass lost by the cluster, with the shape of the cluster profile being of minor influence. When the shock is applied as two separate sub-shocks, the amount of mass loss during the second sub-shock is sensitive to the gap time between them.


#### [A Statistical Semi-Empirical Model: Satellite galaxies in Groups and Clusters](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.00015)
    - **Relevant, Important**
    * STEEL a STatistical sEmi-Empirical modeL designed to probe the distribution of satellite galaxies in groups and clusters.
    * Tracing the abundances of central and satellite haloes via their mass functions at all cosmic epochs -- 基本就是一个基于理论HMF和平均吸积历史的semi-empirical model
    * By enforcing dynamical merging timescales as predicted by high-resolution N-body simulations, we obtain satellite distributions as a function of stellar mass and halo mass consistent with current data.


#### [The Origin of Interstellar Turbulence in M33](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.00019)
    * we consider the energies injected by supernovae (SNe), the magneto-rotational instability (MRI), and the gravity-driven turbulence from accreted materials as the sources of turbulent energy.
    * when we let the dissipation time to be equal to the crossing time of turbulence across the HI scale-height, the SNe energy is enough to maintain turbulence out to 7 kpc radius, and the sum of SNe and MRI energies is able to maintain turbulence out to 8 kpc radius.
    * Due to lack of constraint in the mass accretion rate through the disk of M33, we can not rule out the accretion driven turbulence as a possible source of energy. 


#### [Possible depletion of metals into dust grains in the core of the Centaurus cluster of galaxies](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.00121)
    - **Interesting**
    * we confirm the existence of a central drop in the abundances of the `reactive' elements Fe, Si, S, Mg and Ca, within r≲10 kpc.
    * Adopting our most conservative approach, we find that, unlike the central drops seen for Fe, Si, S, Mg and Ca, the abundance of the `non-reactive' element Ar is fully consistent with showing no central drop
    * Our results corroborate the `dust depletion scenario', previously proposed by Panagoulia et al. (2013, 2015), in which central metal abundance drops are explained by the deposition of a significant fraction of centrally cooled reactive metals into dust grains present in the central regions of the Centaurus cluster.


#### [Calibrating the James Webb Space Telescope filters as star formation rate indicators](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.00534)
    - **Useful**
    * We use Balmer decrement corrected Hα luminosity and synthesized mid-infrared photometry to empirically calibrate the Spitzer, WISE and JWST filters as star formation rate indicators. 
    * we find a power-law relationship between mid-infrared luminosity and star formation rate for low luminosity galaxies
    * We find that the scatter in the JWST filter calibrations decreases with increasing wavelength from 0.39 to 0.20 dex, although F1000W is an exception where the scatter is just 0.24 dex.


#### [On the existence of bright IR galaxies at z>2: tension between Herschel and SCUBA-2 results?](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.00682)
    * Recent derivations of the galaxy star formation rate density (SFRD) obtained from sub-millimetre (sub-mm) surveys (e.g., SCUBA-2) show a tension with previous works based on Herschel and multi-wavelength data. Some of these works claim that the SFRD derived by pushing the Herschel surveys beyond z~2 are incorrect.
    * In particular, we find that the assumed spectral energy distribution (SED) plays a crucial role in the total IR LF derivation, moreover, we confirm that the long-wavelength (e.g., 850-micron) surveys can be incomplete against "warm" SED galaxies, and that the use of a wide spectral coverage of IR wavelengths is crucial to limit the uncertainties and biases.


#### [Orbit properties of massive prolate galaxies in the Illustris simulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.00692)
    - **Relevant, Important**
    * We find that box orbits dominate the orbit structure for most prolate-triaxial galaxies, especially in the central region. 
    * The fraction of irregular orbits in the prolate-triaxial galaxies is small, and it increases with galaxy radius. 
    * Both the x-tube and z-tube orbits are important in prolate-triaxial galaxies, especially in the outer regions.
    * The fraction of box orbits increases and the fractions of x-tube and z-tube orbits weakly decrease with increasing baryon fraction


#### [MUSE-AO view of the starburst-AGN connection: NGC 7130](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.00692)
    * We present the discovery of a small 0.2′′ (60 pc) radius kinematically decoupled core, as well as an outflow jet, in the archetypical AGN-starburst "composite" galaxy NGC 7130
    * A plume of material extends towards the NE from the nucleus until at least the edge of our FOV at 2′′ (640 pc) radius which we interpret as an outflow jet originating in the AGN. The plume is not visible morphologically, but is clearly characterised in our data by emission lines ratios characteristic of AGN emission, enhanced gas velocity dispersion, and distinct non-circular gas velocities. Its orientation is roughly perpendicular to line of nodes of the rotating host galaxy disk.

## Dec 4:

#### [What Is Inside Matters: Simulated Green Valley Galaxies Have Centrally Concentrated Star Formation](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.01017)
    * IFU观测看到的是星系中心的SFR的下降和整体的SFR的被抑制有关，本文从Eagle和Illustris模拟看类似的现象
    * Simulated specific star formation rate profiles are in loose agreement with observations, although galaxies from the EAGLE simulation are too centrally peaked, and galaxies from Illustris have a steeper decline at large radii.
    * 但是模拟里的green valley星系的SFR profile都是有central peak的，和观测明显不一致


#### [The Next Generation Virgo Cluster Survey. XXIII. Fundamentals of nuclear star clusters over seven decades in galaxy mass](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.01019)
    - **Important, Relevant** 是非常好的了解NSC形成的背景介绍
    * 400个 logMs在5-12之间的早型星系的NSCs的性质
    * 包含有NSC的星系的频率和质量的关系在logMs=9有peak，两边下降，但是一直到质量非常低的星系里都有NSC
    * low-mass end nucleation is more frequent in denser environments.
    * NSC的质量函数的turn-over质量比球状星团的大5倍
    * NSC的质量和星系质量之间有非线性的关系
    * an intrinsic scatter in NSC masses at fixed galaxy stellar mass of 0.4 dex, which we interpret as evidence that the process of NSC growth is significantly stochastic. (或者是stripping的影响)


#### [Chemical Abundance Analysis of Tucana III, the Second r-process Enhanced Ultra-Faint Dwarf Galaxy](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.01022)
    * The four stars have chemical abundance patterns consistent with the one previously studied star in Tucana III: they are moderately enhanced in r-process elements. 
    * The non-neutron-capture elements generally follow trends seen in other dwarf galaxies, including a metallicity spread of 0.44 dex and the expected trend in α-elements, i.e., the lower metallicity stars have higher Ca and Ti abundance.  

#### [The Fornax Deep Survey with VST. V. Exploring the faintest regions of the bright early-type galaxies inside the virial radius](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.01050)
    - **Relevant**
    * 对Fornax维力半径以内所有星系的测光测量：From the isophote fit, we derive the azimuthally averaged surface brightness profiles, the position angle and ellipticity profiles as a function of the semi-major axis. In each band, we derive the total magnitudes, effective radii, integrated colors and stellar mass-to-light ratios.
    * The observations suggest that the Fornax cluster is not completely relaxed inside the virial radius. The bulk of the gravitational interactions between galaxies happens in the W-NW core region of the cluster

#### [The Massive and Distant Clusters of WISE Survey V: Extended Radio Sources in Massive Galaxy Clusters at z~1](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.01052)
    * JVLA观测高红移星系团内射电星系的射点形态
    * Out of the ten targeted sources, six are FR II sources, one is an FR I source, and three sources have undetermined morphologies. Eight radio sources have associated Spitzer data, 75% presenting infrared counterparts. 
    * A majority of these counterparts are consistent with being massive galaxies.


#### [The Influence of the Dynamic State of Galaxy Clusters on Segregation Phenomena and Velocity Dispersion Profiles](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.01095)
    * 按照星系团内星系的速度分布分类成Gaussian和Non-Gaussian系统：Our results indicate a strong spatial segregation between active and passive galaxies both in G and NG systems
    * We also found a clear evolutionary trend for G systems, with brighter galaxies in richer clusters having flatter VDPs. The scenario emerging from this study suggests a direct relationship between segregation effects, VDPs and the dynamic state of clusters.


#### [Exploring galaxy evolution with generative models](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.01114)
    - **Interesting**
    * By learning a latent space representation of the data, we can use this network to forward model and explore hypotheses in a data-driven way. We train a neural network to generate artificial data to test hypotheses for the underlying physical processes


#### [Infrared echo and late-stage rebrightening of nuclear transient PS1-10adi: exploring Torus by tidal disruption event in active galactic nuclei](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.01295)
    * We report the discovery of a long-lasting luminous mid-infrared (mid-IR) flare in PS1-10adi, which is a newly-identified highly energetic transient event occurred in AGN 可以用TDE解释
    * The torus dust is sublimating during the early stage of the outburst and probably lead to the observed rapid emergence of Fe II lines.
    * Moreover, the UV-optical rebrightening and contemporaneous X-ray onset after ∼1500 rest-frame days since the optical peak is also an intriguing feature 可能来自告诉外流和torus的相互作用


#### [Nonaxisymmetric models of galaxy velocity maps](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.01447)
    * We show that if a galaxy is not axisymmetric, there is an intrinsic degeneracy between a rotational and a radial velocity field.  比如用Rotating disk模型或者Rotating tilted-ring模型得到的
    * 提出了一种新模型：the radial ellipse model (REM), that is not axisymmetric and has a purely radial velocity field with an amplitude that is correlated with the major axis of the ellipse
    * 运动学拟合中未必是residual最好的，但是 disentangle between circular and radial motions for the case of nonaxisymmetric systems. 

#### [VLT/FLAMES high-resolution chemical abundances in Sculptor: a textbook dwarf spheroidal galaxy](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.01486)
    * 99颗红巨星的高分辨观测：This includes abundances of Li (detected in 1 out of 99 stars), Na, α-elements (O, Mg, Si, Ca Ti), iron-peak elements (Sc, Cr, Fe, Co, Ni, Zn), r- and s-process elements (Ba, La, Nd, Eu).
    * There is a marked decrease in [α/Fe] over our sample, from the Galactic halo plateau value at low [Fe/H] and then, after a `knee', a decrease to sub-solar [α/Fe] at high [Fe/H]. 


#### [The FMOS-COSMOS survey of star-forming galaxies at z∼1.6 VI: Redshift and emission-line catalog and basic properties of star-forming galaxies](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.01529)
    * H-band and J-band medium-resolution (R∼3000) spectra with FMOS
    *  We use the larger sample to re-define the stellar mass--star formation rate relation based on the dust-corrected Hα luminosity, and find that the individual galaxies are better fit with a parametrization including a bending feature at M∗≈10^10.2 M


#### [Chandra centres for COSMOS X-ray galaxy groups: Differences in stellar properties between central dominant and offset brightest group galaxies](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.01604)
    - **Interesting, Relevant**
    * COSMOS场里 247个X-ray星系群和星系团，红移在 0.08-1.53之间 
    * 看BGG和X-ray center的offset与group properties的联系
    * Halo质量越大，红移越低，BGG的offset越小；群内星系和BGG的magnitude gap越大，offset越小
    * At z<0.5, the central dominant BGGs become more massive than those with large offsets by up to 0.3dex, in agreement with model prediction. 


#### [Effect of non-equilibrium ionization on derived physical conditions of the high-z intergalactic medium](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.01016)
    * We study the effect of non-equilibrium ionization evolution and UV ionizing background (UVB) generated with different quasar spectral energy distribution (SED) on the derived physical conditions of the intergalactic medium (IGM) at 2≤z≤6 using our post-processing tool
    * 非平衡态电离模型下，HeII再电离更迅速：The redshift of HeII reionization strongly depends on the quasar SED and occurs earlier for UVB models with flatter quasar SEDs.


#### [A joint ALMA-Bolocam-Planck SZ study of the pressure distribution in RX J1347.5-1145](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.01034)
    - **Interesting** 有助于理解SZ观测和拟合
    * RX1347是正在并合中的高温，高光度星系团; 有两个相距100 kpc的BCG
    * developed a parametric fitting procedure that uses native imaging and visibility data, and tested it using the rich data sets from ALMA, Bolocam, and Planck available for this object.
    * SZ signal can be well-described by a single, smooth ellipsoidal generalised Navarro-Frank-White profile, centred between the two brightest cluster galaxies (BCGs) and with a core cuspiness between that derived from cool-core and morphologically disturbed samples of clusters.
    * Furthermore, the majority of features seen in the X-ray can be explained as predominantly isobaric structures, alleviating the need for highly supersonic velocities, although over-pressurised regions associated with the moving subhalos are still present in our model.


#### [Expected intermediate mass black holes in the Virgo cluster. I. Early-type galaxies](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.01231)

#### [Radiative AGN feedback on a moving mesh: the impact of the galactic disc and dust physics on outflow properties](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.01611)
    * radiation-hydrodynamic simulations of radiative AGN feedback using the novel Arepo-RT
    * For a spherically symmetric NFW halo, an examination of the simulated outflow properties generated by radiative feedback demonstrates that they are lower than typically observed at a fixed AGN luminosity
    * 星系形成时Halo的收缩以及对尘埃的模拟让halo里面的光学厚度增加了很多，辐射可以更好的和气体进行动量耦合，产生更强的shock

#### [Efficacy of early stellar feedback in low gas surface density environments](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.01614)
    * Arepo-RT的模拟：We show that radiation fields decrease the star formation rate and therefore the total stellar mass formed by a factor of ∼2
    * Radiation feedback coupled with SNe is more efficient at driving outflows with the mass and energy loading increasing by a factor of ∼10.  
    * including radiation fields tends to launch colder, denser and higher mass and energy loaded outflows. This is because photoheating of the high density gas around a newly formed star over-pressurises the region, causing it to expand.


#### [Discovery of a Damped Lyα System in a Low-z Galaxy Group: Possible Evidence for Gas Inflow and Nuclear Star Formation](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.01632)
    * z=0.029的DLA: We detected weak Lymanα emission centered at the absorption trough of the DLA. The emission was likely tracing the neutral HI reservoir around the galaxies in the interacting pair, which scattered the Lymanα generated by star formation within those galaxies.

#### [Analyzing temporal variations of AGN emission line profiles in the context of (dusty) cloud structure formation in the broad line region](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.01680)
    * 看Torus和BLR的关系：we compare changes of the dust radius to shape variations of broad emission lines (BEL).
    * While the radius of the dust torus decreased by almost a factor of two from 2004 to 2006 shape variations can be seen in the red wing of BELs of NGC~4151
    * We also use the BEL shape variations to assess possible cloud distributions, especially in azimuthal direction, which could be responsible for the observed variations.

#### [Cluster Cosmology Constraints from the 2500 deg2 SPT-SZ Survey: Inclusion of Weak Gravitational Lensing Data from Magellan and the Hubble Space Telescope](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.01679)
    - **Important**
    * The sample spans the redshift range 0.25<z<1.75 and consists of 377 cluster candidates with SZ detection
    * The sample is supplemented with optical weak gravitational lensing measurements of 32 clusters in the range 0.29<z<1.13 (using data from Magellan and the Hubble Space Telescope) and X-ray measurements of 89 cluster in the range 0.25<z<1.75 (from Chandra).

    * 星暴星系中心的SF和SNe使得其成为很重要的CR来源；CR有可能在逃出星系前损失大部分能量，这是由ISM的湍动level决定的
    * we study the implications of cosmic ray confinement in terms of multifrequency emission from starburst nuclei and production of high energy neutrinos.
    * Electrons and positrons produced as secondary products of hadronic interactions are found to be responsible for most of the emission of leptonic origin. In particular, synchrotron emission of very high energy secondary electrons produces an extended emission of hard X-rays that represent a very interesting signature of hadronic process in starburst galaxies, potentially accessible to current and future observations in the X-ray band

#### [ALMA Observations of Giant Molecular Clouds in the Starburst Dwarf Galaxy Henize 2-10](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.02180)

#### [The dynamic stage of clusters and its influence on the stellar populations of galaxies](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.02499)
    * We found lower mean stellar ages in unrelaxed clusters relative to relaxed clusters.
    * We also observe relations between the mean stellar age and mass of relaxed and unrelaxed clusters, massive systems presenting higher mean ages.
    * Our results suggest that differences between relaxed and unrelaxed clusters are mainly driven by low-mass systems in the clusters outskirts, and that, while pre-processing can be seen in the subcomponents of dynamically young clusters, some evolution in the stellar populations must occur during the clusters relaxation.


#### [Chandra Early-Type Galaxy Atlas](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.02718)
    - **Useful**
    * In our Chandra Galaxy Atlas (CGA) project, taking full advantage of the Chandra capabilities, we systematically analyzed the archival Chandra data of 70 ETGs and produced uniform data products for the hot gas properties. 
    * We emphasize that new features can be identified in the spectral maps which are not readily visible in the surface brightness maps.

#### [The simultaneous formation of cored, tangentially biased, and kinematically decoupled centers in massive early-type galaxies](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.02732)
    - **Interesting, Important**
    * The ETG models include realistic stellar and dark matter components and are evolved with the GADGET based regularized tree code KETJU. 
    * We show that observed key properties of the nuclear stellar populations of massive ETGs, namely flat stellar density distributions (cores), tangentially biased velocity distributions and kinematically decoupled (counter-)rotation can naturally result from a single process − the scouring by SMBHs. 需要mass ratio > 1/3的major merger
    * These features originate from spin reversals during the decay of the SMBH orbits caused by gravitational torques from tidally expelled nuclear material. 
    * Low-density stellar cores scoured in (multiple) minor mergers are less tangentially biased.


#### [The Secondary Spin Bias of Dark Matter Haloes](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.02206)
    - **Relevant**
    * 用模拟探索假设：大尺度filament上的吸积会改变halo的角动量，产生spin parameter和clustering之间的相关
    * However, we do not find evidence that the distribution of matter on large scales is related to the spin of haloes.
    * We find that a halo's spin is correlated with its age, concentration, sphericity, and mass accretion rate.
    * We also find that high spin haloes are slightly more likely to be found near another halo of comparable mass


#### [The Megaparsec-scale Gas-sloshing Spiral in the Remnant Cool Core Cluster Abell 1763](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.02645)
    * Image analysis of a 19.6 ks Chandra archival observation reveals a cluster-wide spiral of enhanced surface brightness in the intracluster medium (ICM). 
    * 类似的spiral常通过sloshing strong cool core产生
    * The cluster merger model of SCC destruction invokes low impact parameter infall as the condition required for core transformation.

#### [Be it therefore resolved: Cosmological Simulations of Dwarf Galaxies with Extreme Resolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.02749)
    * 超高分辨率30太阳质量：sufficient (for the first time) to resolve the internal structure of individual supernovae remnants within the cooling radius
    * 所有10^8.6 Msun以上的halo里面都有星系；
    * UFD的恒星形成历史截断得很早，可能是因为再电离；10^5 Msun以上的经典矮星系可以一直形成恒星到z<0.5
    * 恒星形成历史非常bursty，SF在空间和时间上的分布都很不均匀
    * The stellar metallicities are lower than in LG dwarfs; this may reflect pre-enrichment of the LG by the massive hosts or Pop-III stars.

#### [SDSS-IV MaNGA: local and global chemical abundance patterns in early-type galaxies](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.02753)
    - **Relevant**
    * 366个星系10^10-10^11 Msun通过叠加看到1 Re处的金属丰度
    * We find that C, Mg, and Ti trace each other both as a function of galaxy radius and galaxy mass
    * Conversely, N and Ca are generally offset to lower abundances. The under-abundance of Ca compared to Mg implies delayed enrichment of Ca through Type Ia supernovae, whereas the correlated behaviour of Ti and the lighter α elements, C and Mg, suggest contributions to Ti from Type II supernovae.
    * However, we measure strong negative radial gradients for [N/Fe] and [Na/Fe], of up to −0.25±0.05 and −0.29±0.02 dex/Re respectively. These gradients become shallower with decreasing galaxy mass

    * 但是还是需要肉眼检查：he resulting LinKS sample is composed of 1983 rank-ordered targets classified as "potential lens candidates" by at least one inspector.


#### [SDSS-IV MaStar -- A Large and Comprehensive Empirical Stellar Spectral Library: First Release](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.02745)
    - **Useful**
    * MaNGA Stellar Library (MaStar), which is a large, well-calibrated, high-quality empirical library covering the wavelength range of 3,622-10,354A at a resolving power of R~1800
    * the MaStar library will have a higher number of stars and a more comprehensive stellar-parameter coverage, especially of cool dwarfs, low-metallicity stars, and stars with different [alpha/Fe]
    * This empirical library will provide a new basis for stellar population synthesis, and is particularly well-suited for stellar-population analysis of MaNGA galaxies.


#### [Chandra Detection of the Circumnuclear Molecular Torus of the Compton Thick AGN in NGC 5643](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.02764)
    * We report a clumpy elongated feature found with deep Chandra ACIS high-resolution imaging of the Fe K{\alpha} line emission in the nuclear region of the Compton Thick Active Galactic Nucleus (CT AGN) galaxy NGC 5643
    * The Fe K{\alpha} feature is spatially consistent with the N-S elongation found in the CO(2-1) high resolution imaging with ALMA (Alonso-Herrero et al 2018), but slightly more extended than the rotating molecular disk of r=26 pc indicated by the kinematics of the CO(2-1) line.


#### [Evidence for Optically Thick, Eddington-limited Winds Driven by Supercritical Accretion](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.02923)
    * If most of the hard X-rays from the central disk are obscured by the wind, the source will display a blackbody-like spectrum with a luminosity scaled with the mass of the compact object. 
    * From the Chandra archive of nearby galaxies, we selected a sample of luminous and very soft sources and excluded contaminations from foreground objects and supernova remnants. They are found to be preferentially associated with late-type galaxies.
    * The most likely explanation is that they are due to emission from the photosphere of a wind driven by supercritical accretion onto compact objects. 来自中子星或者恒星级别的黑洞

#### [Semi-analytic modelling of the europium production by neutron star mergers in the halo of the Milky Way](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.03218)
    * Munich-Groningen semi-analytic galaxy formation model, applied to three high resolution Aquarius dark matter simulation 用EU元素trace银河系Halo里面r-过程元素的演化和中子星并合的关系
    * We find that a standard distribution of NS kick velocities decreases [Eu/Mg] abundances of halo stars by ∼0.5~dex compared to models where NS do not receive a kick. With low NS kick velocities, our simulations match observed [Eu/Mg] abundances of halo stars reasonably well, for stars with metallicities [Mg/H]≥−1.5. 


#### [The VLA-COSMOS 3 GHz Large Project: Average radio spectral energy distribution of highly star-forming galaxies](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.03392)
    * average radio spectral energy distribution (SED) of highly star-forming galaxies (HSFGs) up to z~4. 
    * IR和射电光度比值q结合红外-射电相关，可以用来估计SFR；高红移的q值似乎变低，可能是因为对射电SED了解不够，不能简单用一个power law描述的缘故。但本文研究认为应该不是射电SED造成的
    * VLA+GMRT:  By fitting a broken power-law, we find that the spectral index changes from α1=0.42±0.06 below a rest-frame frequency of 4.3 GHz to α2=0.94±0.06 above 4.3 GHz.
    * SED of HSFGs to differ from the SED found for normal SFGs (SFR<10M0/yr). The difference is mainly in a steeper spectrum around 10 GHz, which could indicate a smaller fraction of thermal free-free emission

#### [Comparing galaxy morphology in hydrodynamical simulation and in semi-analytic model](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.03645)
    * Illustris和一个SAM预测的比较，晚型星系的形态分类基本一致，早型星系很多差异很大
    * In the SAM, major merger and frequent minor mergers result in the growth of bulges and turn the galaxy into early type, while bulge formation is not connected to mergers as tightly as in SAM for the Illustris galaxies. 
    * The satellite stellar mass can decrease significantly due to tidal stripping before merging into the central galaxy in Illustris, while it does not decrease in the SAM model.

    * The cluster elongations are estimated by computing density maps of red sequence galaxies.
    * An agreement between the major axis of the BCG and the cluster elongation at large scale within +-30 deg is found for 12 clusters out of the 21 for which both PAs can be defined.

#### [Hubble Constant from LSST Strong lens time delays with microlensing systematics](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.03405)
    * Due to the inclination of the finite AGN accretion disc and the differential magnification of the coherent temperature fluctuations, the microlensing by the stars can lead to changes in the actual time delay on the light-crossing time scale of the emission region ∼days. 
    * 看这个如何影响LSST时代的H0测量精度: The relative uncertainty of H0 will be enlarged to 0.47%, 0.51%, 0.76%, respectively from the one without microlensing impact 0.45%.

    * Absorption lines of H2 and HD molecules observed at high redshift in the line of sight towards quasars are a test ground to search for variation of the proton-to-electron mass ratio μ.
    * A new list of molecular data is compiled for future analyses of cold clouds of hydrogen absorbers, specifically for studies of μ-variation from quasar data. 


#### [Towards emulating cosmic shear data: revisiting the calibration of the shear measurements for the Kilo-Degree Survey](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.03628)
    - **Relevant**
    * We present a framework for calibrating shear with image simulations that demonstrates the importance of including realistic correlations between galaxy morphology, size and more importantly, photometric redshifts.
    * We emulate Kilo-Degree Survey (KiDS) observations of the COSMOS field using morphological information from {\it Hubble} Space Telescope imaging, faithfully reproducing the measured galaxy properties from KiDS observations of the same field
    * To improve the calibration for future cosmic shear analyses, it will be essential to also correctly account for the measurement of photometric redshifts, which requires simulating multi-band observations.
