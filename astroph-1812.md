#### [CHILES: HI morphology and galaxy environment at z=0.12 and z=0.17](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.12405)
    * We focus on two redshift ranges between 0.108 ≤ z ≤ 0.127 and 0.162 ≤ z ≤ 0.183 which are among the worst affected by radio frequency interference (RFI).
    * We report on our in-depth testing of an automated spectral line source finder to pro- duce H i total intensity maps which we present side-by-side with significance maps to evaluate the reliability of the morphology recovered by the source finder.
    * Many of the detections show disturbed H i morphologies suggesting they have undergone a recent interaction which is not evi- dent from deep optical imaging alone.


#### [The Impact of Enhanced Halo Resolution on the Simulated Circumgalactic Medium](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.12410)
    * We introduce the technique of Enhanced Halo Resolution (EHR), enabling more realistic physical modeling of the simulated CGM by consistently forcing gas refinement to smaller scales throughout the virial halo of a simulated galaxy.
    * EHR (1) changes the thermal balance of the CGM, increasing its cool gas content and decreasing its warm/hot gas content; (2) preserves cool gas structures for longer periods; and (3) enables these cool clouds to exist at progressively smaller size scales.


#### [Star formation and gas in the minor merger UGC 10214](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.12417)
    * The comparison of the molecular gas mass and current SFR gives a molecular gas depletion time of about ∼ 2 Gyr (based on Hα), comparable to those of normal spiral galaxies.
    * we find that the SFR has increased by a factor of about 2-3 during the recent past.
    * The atomic and molecular gas distribution is asymmetric, but the position-velocity diagram along the major axis shows a pattern of regular rotation.


#### [Candidate Massive Galaxies at z∼4 in the Dark Energy Survey](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.12422)
    - **Relevant**
    * Using stellar population models, we predicted that the Dark Energy Survey (DES) - due to its special combination of area (5000 deg.sq.) and depth (i = 24.3) - would be in the position to detect massive (  10^11 M⊙) galaxies at z ∼ 4.
    * We finally select 233 candidates whose photometric redshift probability distribution function peaks around z ∼ 4, have high stellar masses (log(M∗/M⊙) ∼ 11.7 for a Salpeter IMF) and ages around 0.1 Gyr

#### [Subhalo destruction in the Apostle and Auriga simulations](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.12437)
    * We introduce a new method for tracking the orbits of subhalos between simulation snapshots that gives accurate results down to a few kiloparsecs from the centre of the halo.
    * Relative to a dark matter-only simulation, the abundance of subhalos in Apostle is reduced by 50% near the centre and by 10% within the virial radius.
    * The velocity distributions of subhalos are also affected by the presence of the galaxy, much more so in Auriga than in Apostle.

#### [Radiative Stellar Feedback in Galaxy Formation: Methods and Physics](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.12437)
    * We study dwarf through Milky Way masses, and explore RHD effects including H/He photoionization; photoelectric, Lyman Werner, Compton, thermal dust heating; single and multiple-scattering radiation pressure (RP).
    * In all cases, the dominant RFB channels on galaxy scales are photoionization heating and single-scattering RP.
    * At all masses, most of the ionizing/FUV luminosity from young stars (~half bolometric) is absorbed. In dwarfs, the strongest effect is photoionization heating from the meta-galactic background, suppressing accretion onto galaxies.


#### [Broad absorption line disappearance/emergence in multiple ions in a weak emission-line quasar](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.12483)
    * We report the discovery of disappearance of Mg ii, Al iii, C iv, and Si iv broad absorption lines (BALs) at the same velocity, accompanied by a new Civ BAL emerging at a higher velocity, in the quasar J0827+4252 at z = 2.038.
    * The simultaneous Civ BAL disappearance and emergence at different velocities, together with no variations in the CRTS light curve, indicate that ionization changes in the absorbing material are unlikely to cause the observed BAL variability.

#### [No evidence for enhanced [OIII] 88um emission in a z~6 quasar compared to its companion starbursting galaxy](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.12836)
    * We present ALMA band 8 observations of the [O III] 88μm line and the underlying thermal infrared continuum emission in the z=6.08 quasar CFHQS J2100–1715
    * 两个系统，一个有QSO，一个没有，比较ISM
    * Bright [OIII] 88μm emission from ionized gas is detected in both systems; the positions and line–widths are consistent with earlier [CII] measurements, indicating that both lines trace the same gravitational potential on galactic scales.
    * This suggests that gas ionization by the quasar (expected to lead to strong optical [O III] 5008  ̊A emission) does not dominantly determine the quasar’s FIR [O III] 88μm luminosity.


#### [Major Mergers between Dark Matter Haloes -- I: Predictions for Size, Shape and Spin](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.12839)
    - **Relevant**
    * We have performed a large set of simulations of binary mergers between isolated, truncated halos with various density profiles, to map out the relationship between the initial conditions and merger parameters and the structure of the final remnant
    * The outcomes of mergers are most easily understood in terms of a scaled dimensionless energy parameter κ and an angular momentum (or spin) parameter λ.
    * We find that the axis ratio c/a scales roughly linearly with energy κ, while the axis ratio b/a scales linearly with spin λ
    * Qualitatively, mergers on radial orbits produce prolate remnants, while mergers on tangential orbits produce oblate remnants.


#### [Major Mergers between Dark Matter Haloes -- II: Profile and Concentration Changes](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.12844)
    * The remnants typically have higher densities than the ini- tial conditions, but differ only slightly from self-similar scaling predictions.
    * As expected, energetic encounters produce more extended remnants while mergers of strongly bound systems produce compact rem- nants.
    * the scale radius of the density profile shows the opposite trend; increasing in the remnants of low-energy encounters relative to energetic ones. Even in the most energetic encounters, the density within the scale radius decreases only slightly (by 10–20%), while for very low-energy systems it increases significantly after the merger.


#### [Sub-percent Photometry: Faint DA White Dwarf Spectrophotometric Standards for Astrophysical Observatories](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.12534)
    - **Beautiful, Useful**
    * We have established a network of 19 faint (16.5 mag < V <19 mag) northern and equatorial DA white dwarfs as spectrophotometric standards for present and future wide-field observatories
    * The excellent agreement between observations and models validates the use of non-local- thermodynamic-equilibrium (NLTE) DA white dwarf atmospheres extinguished by interstellar dust as accurate spectrophotometric references.

## Dec 3:

#### [Low star formation efficiency in typical galaxies at z=5-6](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.00006)
    * We report the detection of CO(2–1) line emission from a Lyman Break Galaxy at z ∼ 5.7 with the VLA. The CO line luminosity implies a massive molecular gas reservoir
    * 分子气体贮藏质量大，SF效率比很多z>5的星暴星系都低，很z>3的MS星系差不多
    * We also obtain a deep CO upper limit for a Main Sequence galaxy at z ∼ 5.3 with ∼ 3 times lower SFR, perhaps implying a high αCO conversion factor, as typically found in low metallicity galaxies.
    * 其他星系观测的上限指出了alpha_CO值较高，结合看到[NII] 205micron弱发射线，说明z=5-6的普通星系里面辐射强较硬，ISM金属丰度可能比较低
    * Our sample shows evidence for high dust temperatures, and a young starburst producing high radiation intensity and hardness even with substantial dust obscuration


#### [A systematic analysis of star cluster disruption by tidal shocks -- I. Controlled N-body simulations and a new theoretical model](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.00014)
    * We find that the strength of the shock and the density of the cluster within the half-mass radius are the dominant properties that drive the amount of mass lost by the cluster, with the shape of the cluster profile being of minor influence. When the shock is applied as two separate sub-shocks, the amount of mass loss during the second sub-shock is sensitive to the gap time between them.


#### [A Statistical Semi-Empirical Model: Satellite galaxies in Groups and Clusters](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.00015)
    - **Relevant, Important**
    * STEEL a STatistical sEmi-Empirical modeL designed to probe the distribution of satellite galaxies in groups and clusters.
    * Tracing the abundances of central and satellite haloes via their mass functions at all cosmic epochs -- 基本就是一个基于理论HMF和平均吸积历史的semi-empirical model
    * By enforcing dynamical merging timescales as predicted by high-resolution N-body simulations, we obtain satellite distributions as a function of stellar mass and halo mass consistent with current data.


#### [The Origin of Interstellar Turbulence in M33](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.00019)
    * we consider the energies injected by supernovae (SNe), the magneto-rotational instability (MRI), and the gravity-driven turbulence from accreted materials as the sources of turbulent energy.
    * when we let the dissipation time to be equal to the crossing time of turbulence across the HI scale-height, the SNe energy is enough to maintain turbulence out to 7 kpc radius, and the sum of SNe and MRI energies is able to maintain turbulence out to 8 kpc radius.
    * Due to lack of constraint in the mass accretion rate through the disk of M33, we can not rule out the accretion driven turbulence as a possible source of energy. 


#### [Possible depletion of metals into dust grains in the core of the Centaurus cluster of galaxies](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.00121)
    - **Interesting**
    * we confirm the existence of a central drop in the abundances of the `reactive' elements Fe, Si, S, Mg and Ca, within r≲10 kpc.
    * Adopting our most conservative approach, we find that, unlike the central drops seen for Fe, Si, S, Mg and Ca, the abundance of the `non-reactive' element Ar is fully consistent with showing no central drop
    * Our results corroborate the `dust depletion scenario', previously proposed by Panagoulia et al. (2013, 2015), in which central metal abundance drops are explained by the deposition of a significant fraction of centrally cooled reactive metals into dust grains present in the central regions of the Centaurus cluster.


#### [Calibrating the James Webb Space Telescope filters as star formation rate indicators](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.00534)
    - **Useful**
    * We use Balmer decrement corrected Hα luminosity and synthesized mid-infrared photometry to empirically calibrate the Spitzer, WISE and JWST filters as star formation rate indicators. 
    * we find a power-law relationship between mid-infrared luminosity and star formation rate for low luminosity galaxies
    * We find that the scatter in the JWST filter calibrations decreases with increasing wavelength from 0.39 to 0.20 dex, although F1000W is an exception where the scatter is just 0.24 dex.


#### [On the existence of bright IR galaxies at z>2: tension between Herschel and SCUBA-2 results?](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.00682)
    * Recent derivations of the galaxy star formation rate density (SFRD) obtained from sub-millimetre (sub-mm) surveys (e.g., SCUBA-2) show a tension with previous works based on Herschel and multi-wavelength data. Some of these works claim that the SFRD derived by pushing the Herschel surveys beyond z~2 are incorrect.
    * In particular, we find that the assumed spectral energy distribution (SED) plays a crucial role in the total IR LF derivation, moreover, we confirm that the long-wavelength (e.g., 850-micron) surveys can be incomplete against "warm" SED galaxies, and that the use of a wide spectral coverage of IR wavelengths is crucial to limit the uncertainties and biases.


#### [Orbit properties of massive prolate galaxies in the Illustris simulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.00692)
    - **Relevant, Important**
    * We find that box orbits dominate the orbit structure for most prolate-triaxial galaxies, especially in the central region. 
    * The fraction of irregular orbits in the prolate-triaxial galaxies is small, and it increases with galaxy radius. 
    * Both the x-tube and z-tube orbits are important in prolate-triaxial galaxies, especially in the outer regions.
    * The fraction of box orbits increases and the fractions of x-tube and z-tube orbits weakly decrease with increasing baryon fraction


#### [MUSE-AO view of the starburst-AGN connection: NGC 7130](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.00692)
    * We present the discovery of a small 0.2′′ (60 pc) radius kinematically decoupled core, as well as an outflow jet, in the archetypical AGN-starburst "composite" galaxy NGC 7130
    * A plume of material extends towards the NE from the nucleus until at least the edge of our FOV at 2′′ (640 pc) radius which we interpret as an outflow jet originating in the AGN. The plume is not visible morphologically, but is clearly characterised in our data by emission lines ratios characteristic of AGN emission, enhanced gas velocity dispersion, and distinct non-circular gas velocities. Its orientation is roughly perpendicular to line of nodes of the rotating host galaxy disk.
