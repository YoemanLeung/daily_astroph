#### [CHILES: HI morphology and galaxy environment at z=0.12 and z=0.17](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.12405)


#### [The Impact of Enhanced Halo Resolution on the Simulated Circumgalactic Medium](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.12410)


#### [Star formation and gas in the minor merger UGC 10214](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.12417)
    * The comparison of the molecular gas mass and current SFR gives a molecular gas depletion time of about ∼ 2 Gyr (based on Hα), comparable to those of normal spiral galaxies.
    * we find that the SFR has increased by a factor of about 2-3 during the recent past.
    * The atomic and molecular gas distribution is asymmetric, but the position-velocity diagram along the major axis shows a pattern of regular rotation.


#### [Candidate Massive Galaxies at z∼4 in the Dark Energy Survey](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.12422)


#### [Subhalo destruction in the Apostle and Auriga simulations](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.12437)
    * We introduce a new method for tracking the orbits of subhalos between simulation snapshots that gives accurate results down to a few kiloparsecs from the centre of the halo. 
    * Relative to a dark matter-only simulation, the abundance of subhalos in Apostle is reduced by 50% near the centre and by 10% within the virial radius.
    * The velocity distributions of subhalos are also affected by the presence of the galaxy, much more so in Auriga than in Apostle.

#### [Radiative Stellar Feedback in Galaxy Formation: Methods and Physics](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.12437)
    * We study dwarf through Milky Way masses, and explore RHD effects including H/He photoionization; photoelectric, Lyman Werner, Compton, thermal dust heating; single and multiple-scattering radiation pressure (RP).
    * In all cases, the dominant RFB channels on galaxy scales are photoionization heating and single-scattering RP.
    * At all masses, most of the ionizing/FUV luminosity from young stars (~half bolometric) is absorbed. In dwarfs, the strongest effect is photoionization heating from the meta-galactic background, suppressing accretion onto galaxies.


#### [Broad absorption line disappearance/emergence in multiple ions in a weak emission-line quasar](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.12483)
    * We report the discovery of disappearance of Mg ii, Al iii, C iv, and Si iv broad absorption lines (BALs) at the same velocity, accompanied by a new Civ BAL emerging at a higher velocity, in the quasar J0827+4252 at z = 2.038.
    * The simultaneous Civ BAL disappearance and emergence at different velocities, together with no variations in the CRTS light curve, indicate that ionization changes in the absorbing material are unlikely to cause the observed BAL variability.

#### [No evidence for enhanced [OIII] 88um emission in a z~6 quasar compared to its companion starbursting galaxy](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.12836)
    * 


#### [Major Mergers between Dark Matter Haloes -- I: Predictions for Size, Shape and Spin](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.12839)


#### [Major Mergers between Dark Matter Haloes -- II: Profile and Concentration Changes](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.12844)


#### [Sub-percent Photometry: Faint DA White Dwarf Spectrophotometric Standards for Astrophysical Observatories](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.12534)
    - **Beautiful, Useful**
    *We have established a network of 19 faint (16.5 mag < V <19 mag) northern and equatorial DA white dwarfs as spectrophotometric standards for present and future wide-field observatories  
    * The excellent agreement between observations and models validates the use of non-local- thermodynamic-equilibrium (NLTE) DA white dwarf atmospheres extinguished by interstellar dust as accurate spectrophotometric references.
