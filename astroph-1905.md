* [The Effect of Minor and Major Mergers on the Evolution of Low Excitation Radio Galaxies](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.00018)
  * 用DECaLS图像做的：a sample of 282 Low Excitation Radio Galaxies (LERGs) at z<0.07
  * In groups and in the field, the LERG minor merger fraction is consistent with the control population.
  * In galaxy clusters, 8.8±2.9 % of LERGs show evidence of recent minor mergers in contrast to 23.0±2.0 % of controls. This ∼4σ deficit of minor mergers in cluster LERGs suggests these events may inhibit this type of nuclear activity for galaxies within the cluster environment.
  * 但LERG里的Major merger比例高：We observe a >4σ excess of major mergers in the LERGs with M∗≲10^11M⊙, with 10±1.5 % of these AGN involved in such large-scale interactions
  * This excess of major mergers in LERGs decreases with increasing stellar mass 在大质量星系里不存在

* [Star Formation Histories of the LEGUS Spiral Galaxies. I. The flocculent spiral NGC 7793](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.00020)
  * 分解星族的分析： We determine an average star formation rate (SFR) for the galaxy portion covered by our F555W and F814W data of 0.23 +- 0.02 Msun/yr over the whole Hubble time, corresponding to a total stellar mass of 3.09 +- 0.33 x 10^9 Msun in agreement with previous determinations.
  * We recover the resolved SFH in different radial regions of the galaxy; this shows an indication of a growing trend of the present-to-past SFR ratio, increasing from internal to more external regions, supporting previous findings of the inside-out growth of the galaxy.

* [80 minute light echo signalling a 10,000 solar mass black hole in a bulgeless dwarf galaxy](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.00145)
  * **Interesting**
  * Light echoes from photoionized clouds around accreting black holes, in combination with the velocity of these clouds, yield a direct mass measurement
  * Here we report an exceptionally low reverberation delay of 83±14 minutes between variability in the accretion disk and high velocity Hα emission from the nucleus of the bulgeless dwarf galaxy NGC~4395
  * This lag determines a mass of about 10,000~M⊙ for the black hole
  * This mass is among the smallest central black hole masses reported, near the low end of expected masses for heavy "seeds", and the best direct mass measurement for a galaxy of this size.
  * 但是依然符合M_BH-sigma*关系

* [Starburst and post-starburst high-redshift protogalaxies: The feedback impact of high energy cosmic rays](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.00338)
  * 讨论宇宙线如何影响恒星形成和Quenching：These high energy particles interact with the baryon and radiation fields of their host via hadronic processes to produce secondary leptons. The secondary particles then also interact with ambient radiation fields to generate X-rays through inverse-Compton scattering.
  * At high-redshift, a substantial amount of CR secondary electron energy can be diverted into inverse-Compton X-ray emission. This yields an X-ray luminosity of above 1041 erg s−1 by redshift z=7 which drives a further heating effect, operating over larger scales. 可以停止cold inflow

* [The redshift evolution of X-ray and Sunyaev-Zel'dovich scaling relations in the FABLE simulations](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.00013)
  * **Relevant**
  * 27个高分辨的zoom-in cluster模拟：We predict significant deviations of all examined scaling relations from the simple self-similar expectations.
  * 需要考虑标度关系的红移演化：While the slopes are approximately independent of redshift, the normalisations evolve positively with respect to self-similarity, even for commonly-used mass proxies such as the YX parameter.
  * 导致红移演化的因素：more effective AGN feedback in lower mass haloes, larger binding energy of gas at a given halo mass at higher redshifts and larger non-thermal pressure support from kinetic motions at higher redshifts.
  * We find that the intrinsic scatter of the relations, which agrees well with most observational constraints, increases at lower redshifts and for lower mass systems.

* [Probability of magnification in the Hubble Frontier Fields clusters](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.00017)
  * Free-form gravitational lensing models derived with the WSLAP+ code for the six Hubble Frontier Fields clusters
  * We confirm MACS 0717 as the cluster with the most complex structure, and having the largest lensing efficiency and Einstein radius.

* [Free-form lens model and mass estimation of the high redshift galaxy cluster ACT-CL J0102-4915, "El Gordo"](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.00017)
  * 质量最大的高红移星系团 (z=0.9)，接近了宇宙学模型允许的极限：We use data from the RELICS program and identify new multiply lensed system candidates.
  * By fitting a projected NFW mass distribution to the strong-lensing regime, we infer a total mass for the cluster of M200c=(1.35±0.15)×10^15M⊙
  * We also find in our lens map a mass overdensity corresponding to the large cometary tail of hot gas, reinforcing its interpretation as a large tidal feature predicted by our hydrodynamical simulations
  * El Gordo is one of the first clusters that will be observed with JWST, which is expected to unveil new high redshift lensed galaxies around this interesting cluster, thus allowing us to improve on its mass estimation.

* [GAMA+KiDS: Alignment of galaxies in galaxy groups and its dependence on galaxy scale](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.00370)
  * We measure the alignment of shapes of satellite galaxies, in galaxy groups, with respect to the brightest group galaxy (BGG), as well as alignments of the BGG shape with the satellite positions, using the highly complete Galaxy And Mass Assembly (GAMA) spectroscopic survey and deep imaging from the Kilo Degree Survey.
  * We find a significant satellite radial alignment signal, which vanishes at large separations from the BGG.
  * We do not identify any strong trends of the signal with galaxy absolute magnitude or group mass. The alignment signal is dominated by red satellites.
  * We also find that the outer regions of galaxies are aligned more strongly than their inner regions, by varying the radial weight employed during the shape measurement process.

* [Fluorescent rings in star-free dark matter haloes](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.00430)
  * Photoheating of the gas in low-mass dark matter (DM) haloes prevents baryons from cooling, leaving the haloes free of stars. Gas in these 'dark' haloes remains exposed to the ultraviolet background (UVB), and so is expected to emit via fluorescent recombination lines.
  * 用辐射转移模型来研究气体辐射：We use these simulations to predict surface brightnesses in H-alpha, which we show to have a characteristic ring-shaped morphology for haloes in a narrow mass range between 10^9.5 and 10^9.6 M_sun.
  * We demonstrate how detailed observations of fluorescent rings can be used to infer the properties of the haloes which host them, such as their density profiles and the mass-concentration relation, as well as to directly measure the UVB amplitude.

* [The [CII]--SFR correlation in dwarf galaxies across cosmic time](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.00431)
  * 关于 [CII]-SFR关系，模型认为有金属丰度相关；观测看到的比较大的scatter，但没看到金属丰度相关
  * 用模拟研究这个关系：Our results suggest that the correlation should evolve with metallicity, in agreement with theoretical predictions, but also that this evolution can be hardly detected in observations, because of the large scatter.
  * We also find that most of the [CII] emission is associated with neutral gas at low-intermediate densities, whereas the highest emissivity is produced by the densest regions around star-forming regions.

* [Clues to the nature of dark matter from first galaxies](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.00432)
  * 用一系列模拟来研究：study the impact of a 3 keV warm dark matter (WDM) candidate on the high-redshift Universe
  * WDM suppresses the number of haloes with mass less than few 10^9 M⊙; at a fixed halo mass, WDM produces fewer stars than CDM; and finally at halo masses below 10^9 M⊙, WDM has a larger fraction of dark haloes than CDM post-reionization.
  * 结合在一起使得WDM下SMF在低质量端偏低，For z>7, the global star formation density is lower by a factor of two in the WDM scenario, and for a fixed escape fraction, the fraction of neutral hydrogen is higher by 0.3 at z∼6.
  * 高红移的HI气体比例可以作为区分暗物质模型的关键观测证据

* [Bubble mapping with the Square Kilometer Array - I. Detecting galaxies with Euclid, JWST, WFIRST and ELT within ionized bubbles in the intergalactic medium at z>6](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.00437)
  * 关于SKA对高红移再电离的tomographic观测：In scenarios where star-forming galaxies provide most of the ionizing photons required for cosmic reionization, one expects the first ionized bubbles to be centered on overdensities of such galaxies.
  * We find that, for the bubbles that are within reach of SKA-1 tomography, the bubble volume is closely tied to the number of ionizing photons that have escaped from the galaxies within.
  * In the case of galaxy-dominated reionization, galaxies are expected to turn up above the spectroscopic detection threshold of JWST and ELT in even the smallest resolvable bubbles at redshifts z=10 or below.
  * multiband imaging may be a competitive option for bubbles at z~10, due to the very small number of line-of-sight interlopers expected at similar redshifts.

* [Black hole mass estimates in quasars - A comparative analysis of high- and low-ionization lines](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.00617)
  * We carried out an analysis of the CIV 1549 and Hbeta line profiles of 28 Hamburg-ESO high luminosity quasars and of 48 low-z, low luminosity sources in order to test whether the high-ionization line CIV 1549 width could be correlated with Hbeta and be used as a virial broadening estimator.
  * The present analysis indicates that the line width of CIV 1549 is not immediately offering a virial broadening estimator equivalent to Hβ. At the same time a virialized part of the BLR appears to be preserved even at the highest luminosities.
  * 用CIV线测量高光度AGN的黑洞质量的时候需要小心，需要做FWHM的改正

* [A low-frequency study of recently identified double-double radio galaxies](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.00677)
  * 认为射电星系的linear大小可以代表射电活动的时标：we present high-sensitivity 607-MHz Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (GMRT) images of 21 possible double-double radio galaxies (DDRGs) identified from the FIRST survey to confirm their episodic nature.
  * These GMRT observations show that none of the inner compact components suspected to be hot-spots of the inner doubles are cores having a flat radio spectrum, confirming the episodic nature of these radio sources.
  * The estimated age limits (11 − 52 Myr) are smaller than those of the large-sized (∼ 1 Mpc) DDRGs.

* [Semi-empirical metallicity calibrations based on ultraviolet emission lines of type-2 AGNs](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.00691)
  * We derived two semi-empirical calibrations between the metallicity of the Narrow Line Region (NLR) of type-2 Active Galactic Nuclei and the rest-frame of the N Vλ1240/He IIλ1640, C43=log[(C IVλ1549+C III]λ1909)/HeIIλ1640] and C III]λ1909/C IVλ1549 emission-line intensity ratios.
  * Using the derived calibrations, it was possible to show that the metallicity estimations for NLRs are lower by a factor of about 2-3 than those for Broad Line Regions (BLRs).
  * 确认了恒星质量和窄线区金属丰度之间的关系：we confirmed the recent result of the existence of a relation between the stellar mass of the host galaxy and its NLR metallicity. We also derived a M−Z relation for the objects in our sample at 1.6<z<3.8.

* [ASKAP Commissioning Observations of the GAMA 23 Field](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.00831)
  * **Interesting**
  * This observation covers ∼48 deg2 with synthesized beam of 32.7" by 17.8" at 936 MHz, and ∼39 deg2 with synthesized beam of 15.8" by 12.0" at 1320 MHz.
  * 和GAMA的光谱和图像数据，以及WISE观测比较：In properties including source counts, mass distributions, and IR vs. radio luminosity relation, the ASKAP detected radio sources behave as expected.
  * Radio galaxies have higher stellar mass and luminosity in IR, optical and UV than other galaxies.
  * Radio sources are more likely (∼6%) to have an AGN than radio quiet galaxies (∼1%), but the majority of AGN are not detected in radio at this sensitivity.
