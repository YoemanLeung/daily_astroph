* [The Effect of Minor and Major Mergers on the Evolution of Low Excitation Radio Galaxies](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.00018)
  * 用DECaLS图像做的：a sample of 282 Low Excitation Radio Galaxies (LERGs) at z<0.07
  * In groups and in the field, the LERG minor merger fraction is consistent with the control population.
  * In galaxy clusters, 8.8±2.9 % of LERGs show evidence of recent minor mergers in contrast to 23.0±2.0 % of controls. This ∼4σ deficit of minor mergers in cluster LERGs suggests these events may inhibit this type of nuclear activity for galaxies within the cluster environment.
  * 但LERG里的Major merger比例高：We observe a >4σ excess of major mergers in the LERGs with M∗≲10^11M⊙, with 10±1.5 % of these AGN involved in such large-scale interactions
  * This excess of major mergers in LERGs decreases with increasing stellar mass 在大质量星系里不存在

* [Star Formation Histories of the LEGUS Spiral Galaxies. I. The flocculent spiral NGC 7793](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.00020)
  * 分解星族的分析： We determine an average star formation rate (SFR) for the galaxy portion covered by our F555W and F814W data of 0.23 +- 0.02 Msun/yr over the whole Hubble time, corresponding to a total stellar mass of 3.09 +- 0.33 x 10^9 Msun in agreement with previous determinations.
  * We recover the resolved SFH in different radial regions of the galaxy; this shows an indication of a growing trend of the present-to-past SFR ratio, increasing from internal to more external regions, supporting previous findings of the inside-out growth of the galaxy.

* [80 minute light echo signalling a 10,000 solar mass black hole in a bulgeless dwarf galaxy](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.00145)
  * **Interesting**
  * Light echoes from photoionized clouds around accreting black holes, in combination with the velocity of these clouds, yield a direct mass measurement
  * Here we report an exceptionally low reverberation delay of 83±14 minutes between variability in the accretion disk and high velocity Hα emission from the nucleus of the bulgeless dwarf galaxy NGC~4395
  * This lag determines a mass of about 10,000~M⊙ for the black hole
  * This mass is among the smallest central black hole masses reported, near the low end of expected masses for heavy "seeds", and the best direct mass measurement for a galaxy of this size.
  * 但是依然符合M_BH-sigma*关系

* [Starburst and post-starburst high-redshift protogalaxies: The feedback impact of high energy cosmic rays](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.00338)
  * 讨论宇宙线如何影响恒星形成和Quenching：These high energy particles interact with the baryon and radiation fields of their host via hadronic processes to produce secondary leptons. The secondary particles then also interact with ambient radiation fields to generate X-rays through inverse-Compton scattering.
  * At high-redshift, a substantial amount of CR secondary electron energy can be diverted into inverse-Compton X-ray emission. This yields an X-ray luminosity of above 1041 erg s−1 by redshift z=7 which drives a further heating effect, operating over larger scales. 可以停止cold inflow

* [The redshift evolution of X-ray and Sunyaev-Zel'dovich scaling relations in the FABLE simulations](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.00013)
  * **Relevant**
  * 27个高分辨的zoom-in cluster模拟：We predict significant deviations of all examined scaling relations from the simple self-similar expectations.
  * 需要考虑标度关系的红移演化：While the slopes are approximately independent of redshift, the normalisations evolve positively with respect to self-similarity, even for commonly-used mass proxies such as the YX parameter.
  * 导致红移演化的因素：more effective AGN feedback in lower mass haloes, larger binding energy of gas at a given halo mass at higher redshifts and larger non-thermal pressure support from kinetic motions at higher redshifts.
  * We find that the intrinsic scatter of the relations, which agrees well with most observational constraints, increases at lower redshifts and for lower mass systems.

* [Probability of magnification in the Hubble Frontier Fields clusters](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.00017)
  * Free-form gravitational lensing models derived with the WSLAP+ code for the six Hubble Frontier Fields clusters
  * We confirm MACS 0717 as the cluster with the most complex structure, and having the largest lensing efficiency and Einstein radius.

* [Free-form lens model and mass estimation of the high redshift galaxy cluster ACT-CL J0102-4915, "El Gordo"](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.00017)
  * 质量最大的高红移星系团 (z=0.9)，接近了宇宙学模型允许的极限：We use data from the RELICS program and identify new multiply lensed system candidates.
  * By fitting a projected NFW mass distribution to the strong-lensing regime, we infer a total mass for the cluster of M200c=(1.35±0.15)×10^15M⊙
  * We also find in our lens map a mass overdensity corresponding to the large cometary tail of hot gas, reinforcing its interpretation as a large tidal feature predicted by our hydrodynamical simulations
  * El Gordo is one of the first clusters that will be observed with JWST, which is expected to unveil new high redshift lensed galaxies around this interesting cluster, thus allowing us to improve on its mass estimation.

* [GAMA+KiDS: Alignment of galaxies in galaxy groups and its dependence on galaxy scale](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.00370)
  * We measure the alignment of shapes of satellite galaxies, in galaxy groups, with respect to the brightest group galaxy (BGG), as well as alignments of the BGG shape with the satellite positions, using the highly complete Galaxy And Mass Assembly (GAMA) spectroscopic survey and deep imaging from the Kilo Degree Survey.
  * We find a significant satellite radial alignment signal, which vanishes at large separations from the BGG.
  * We do not identify any strong trends of the signal with galaxy absolute magnitude or group mass. The alignment signal is dominated by red satellites.
  * We also find that the outer regions of galaxies are aligned more strongly than their inner regions, by varying the radial weight employed during the shape measurement process.

* [Fluorescent rings in star-free dark matter haloes](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.00430)
  * Photoheating of the gas in low-mass dark matter (DM) haloes prevents baryons from cooling, leaving the haloes free of stars. Gas in these 'dark' haloes remains exposed to the ultraviolet background (UVB), and so is expected to emit via fluorescent recombination lines.
  * 用辐射转移模型来研究气体辐射：We use these simulations to predict surface brightnesses in H-alpha, which we show to have a characteristic ring-shaped morphology for haloes in a narrow mass range between 10^9.5 and 10^9.6 M_sun.
  * We demonstrate how detailed observations of fluorescent rings can be used to infer the properties of the haloes which host them, such as their density profiles and the mass-concentration relation, as well as to directly measure the UVB amplitude.

* [The [CII]--SFR correlation in dwarf galaxies across cosmic time](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.00431)
  * 关于 [CII]-SFR关系，模型认为有金属丰度相关；观测看到的比较大的scatter，但没看到金属丰度相关
  * 用模拟研究这个关系：Our results suggest that the correlation should evolve with metallicity, in agreement with theoretical predictions, but also that this evolution can be hardly detected in observations, because of the large scatter.
  * We also find that most of the [CII] emission is associated with neutral gas at low-intermediate densities, whereas the highest emissivity is produced by the densest regions around star-forming regions.

* [Clues to the nature of dark matter from first galaxies](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.00432)
  * 用一系列模拟来研究：study the impact of a 3 keV warm dark matter (WDM) candidate on the high-redshift Universe
  * WDM suppresses the number of haloes with mass less than few 10^9 M⊙; at a fixed halo mass, WDM produces fewer stars than CDM; and finally at halo masses below 10^9 M⊙, WDM has a larger fraction of dark haloes than CDM post-reionization.
  * 结合在一起使得WDM下SMF在低质量端偏低，For z>7, the global star formation density is lower by a factor of two in the WDM scenario, and for a fixed escape fraction, the fraction of neutral hydrogen is higher by 0.3 at z∼6.
  * 高红移的HI气体比例可以作为区分暗物质模型的关键观测证据

* [Bubble mapping with the Square Kilometer Array - I. Detecting galaxies with Euclid, JWST, WFIRST and ELT within ionized bubbles in the intergalactic medium at z>6](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.00437)
  * 关于SKA对高红移再电离的tomographic观测：In scenarios where star-forming galaxies provide most of the ionizing photons required for cosmic reionization, one expects the first ionized bubbles to be centered on overdensities of such galaxies.
  * We find that, for the bubbles that are within reach of SKA-1 tomography, the bubble volume is closely tied to the number of ionizing photons that have escaped from the galaxies within.
  * In the case of galaxy-dominated reionization, galaxies are expected to turn up above the spectroscopic detection threshold of JWST and ELT in even the smallest resolvable bubbles at redshifts z=10 or below.
  * multiband imaging may be a competitive option for bubbles at z~10, due to the very small number of line-of-sight interlopers expected at similar redshifts.

* [Black hole mass estimates in quasars - A comparative analysis of high- and low-ionization lines](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.00617)
  * We carried out an analysis of the CIV 1549 and Hbeta line profiles of 28 Hamburg-ESO high luminosity quasars and of 48 low-z, low luminosity sources in order to test whether the high-ionization line CIV 1549 width could be correlated with Hbeta and be used as a virial broadening estimator.
  * The present analysis indicates that the line width of CIV 1549 is not immediately offering a virial broadening estimator equivalent to Hβ. At the same time a virialized part of the BLR appears to be preserved even at the highest luminosities.
  * 用CIV线测量高光度AGN的黑洞质量的时候需要小心，需要做FWHM的改正

* [A low-frequency study of recently identified double-double radio galaxies](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.00677)
  * 认为Double-Double射电星系的linear大小可以代表射电活动的时标：we present high-sensitivity 607-MHz Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (GMRT) images of 21 possible double-double radio galaxies (DDRGs) identified from the FIRST survey to confirm their episodic nature.
  * These GMRT observations show that none of the inner compact components suspected to be hot-spots of the inner doubles are cores having a flat radio spectrum, confirming the episodic nature of these radio sources.
  * The estimated age limits (11 − 52 Myr) are smaller than those of the large-sized (∼ 1 Mpc) DDRGs.

* [Semi-empirical metallicity calibrations based on ultraviolet emission lines of type-2 AGNs](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.00691)
  * We derived two semi-empirical calibrations between the metallicity of the Narrow Line Region (NLR) of type-2 Active Galactic Nuclei and the rest-frame of the N Vλ1240/He IIλ1640, C43=log[(C IVλ1549+C III]λ1909)/HeIIλ1640] and C III]λ1909/C IVλ1549 emission-line intensity ratios.
  * Using the derived calibrations, it was possible to show that the metallicity estimations for NLRs are lower by a factor of about 2-3 than those for Broad Line Regions (BLRs).
  * 确认了恒星质量和窄线区金属丰度之间的关系：we confirmed the recent result of the existence of a relation between the stellar mass of the host galaxy and its NLR metallicity. We also derived a M−Z relation for the objects in our sample at 1.6<z<3.8.

* [ASKAP Commissioning Observations of the GAMA 23 Field](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.00831)
  * **Interesting**
  * This observation covers ∼48 deg2 with synthesized beam of 32.7" by 17.8" at 936 MHz, and ∼39 deg2 with synthesized beam of 15.8" by 12.0" at 1320 MHz.
  * 和GAMA的光谱和图像数据，以及WISE观测比较：In properties including source counts, mass distributions, and IR vs. radio luminosity relation, the ASKAP detected radio sources behave as expected.
  * Radio galaxies have higher stellar mass and luminosity in IR, optical and UV than other galaxies.
  * Radio sources are more likely (∼6%) to have an AGN than radio quiet galaxies (∼1%), but the majority of AGN are not detected in radio at this sensitivity.

### May 5

* [MOCCA-SURVEY Database I. Intermediate mass black holes in Milky Way globular clusters and their connection to supermassive black holes](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.00902)
  * MC GC模型看GC和IMBH的演化联系：We find that the average density of IMBHs sphere of influence can be uniquely connected to the host GCs luminosity and half-light radius via a fundamental plane.
  * Our models show that the IMBH is often bound to a stellar companion or a stellar BH, which can lead to tidal disruption events or to low-frequency gravitational waves.
  * We show that GCs orbiting close to the Galactic Centre have a larger probability to witness IMBH formation during their early evolution.

* [Assembling a RELIC at Redshift 1: Spectroscopic Observations of Galaxies in the RELICS Cluster SPT-CLJ0615-5746](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.00914)
  * **Relevant**
  * We identify ∼50 cluster members and derive a cluster redshift of zc=0.972, with a velocity dispersion of σ=1235±170 km s−1; 用sigma估计M200和之前的相符，质量很大，接近10^15 Msun
  * With an elongated profile in lensing mass and X-ray emission, a non-Gaussian velocity dispersion that increases with clustercentric radius, and a brightest cluster galaxy not at rest with the bulk of the system, there are multiple cluster properties that, while not individually compelling, combine to paint a picture that SPT-CLJ0615−5746 is currently being assembled.

* [Nuclear kinematics in nearby AGN. I. An ALMA perspective on the Morphology and Kinematics of the molecular CO(2-1) emission](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.00994)
  * Molecular gas morphology and kinematics of seven nearby Seyfert galaxies obtained from our 230~GHz ALMA observations.
  * The CO J=2-1 kinematics within the inner ∼30" (≲9~kpc) reveals rotation patterns that have been explored using the Bertola rotation model and a modified version of the Kinemetry package. 可以揭示和circular rotation的偏差
  * 中心分子气体运动的PA和整体系统运动的比较符合，但residual map上也可以看到非圆周运动的证据

* [Time dependent spectral modeling of Markarian 421 during a violent outburst in 2010](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.01043)
  * Mrk421：距离我们最近的Blazar
  * The source underwent rapid flux variations in both X-rays and very high energy (VHE) gamma-rays as it evolved from a low-flux state on 2010 February 13-15 to a high-flux state on 2010 February 17.
  * During this period, the source exhibited significant spectral hardening from X-rays to VHE gamma-rays while exhibiting a "harder when brighter" behavior in these energy bands
  * 模拟SED，使用a time-dependent multi-zone leptonic jet模型

* [The evolution of galaxy intrinsic alignments in the MassiveBlack II universe](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.00906)
  * **Relevant**
  * Dark matter components of z=0.6 galaxies are more spherical than their progenitors while stellar matter components tend to be less spherical than their progenitors.
  * The distribution of the galaxy-subhalo misalignment angle peaks at ∼10 deg with a mild increase with time.
  * The evolution of the ellipticity-direction~(ED) correlation amplitude ω(r) of galaxies is governed by the evolution in the alignment of underlying dark matter~(DM) subhaloes to the matter density of field, as well as the alignment between galaxies and their DM subhaloes.
  * At scales ∼1 cMpc/h, the alignment between DM subhaloes and matter overdensity gets suppressed with time, whereas the alignment between galaxies and DM subhaloes is enhanced
  * 总之就是在<1Mpc的小尺度上红移演化很复杂；> 1 Mpc的尺度上 alignment between DM subhaloes and matter overdensity does not evolve significantly
  * The evolution of the galaxy-subhalo misalignment therefore leads to an increase in ω(r) for galaxies by a factor of ∼4 from z=3 to 0.6 at scales >1 cMpc/h.

* [Estimating the galaxy two-point correlation function using a split random catalog](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.01133)
  * **Relevant**
  * The expected field is commonly specified using a Monte-Carlo sampling of the volume covered by the survey and, to minimize additional sampling errors, this random catalog has to be much larger than the data catalog
  * Given the large number of random objects required to guarantee sub-percent accuracy, it is of paramount importance to improve the efficiency of the algorithm without degrading its precision. We show both analytically and numerically that splitting the random catalog into a number of subcatalogs of the same size as the data catalog when calculating random-random pairs, and excluding pairs across different subcatalogs provides the optimal error at fixed computational cost.
  * For a random catalog fifty times larger than the data catalog, this reduces the computation time by a factor of more than ten without affecting estimator variance or bias.

* [The Life Cycle of the Central Molecular Zone. I: Inflow, Star Formation, and Winds](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.01309)
  * 银心周围4.5kpc的数值模拟：We find that star formation activity in the CMZ goes through oscillatory burst/quench cycles, with a period of tens to hundreds of Myr, characterised by roughly constant gas mass but order-of-magnitude level variations in the star formation rate. 目前接近SF的极小
  * 恒星形成的反馈过程产生two-phase wind：warm phase包括了大多数质量，尤其是形成恒星的部分，但大多数这些warm气体会形成喷泉，回落银盘
  * Hot phase则携带了大部分能量，站了SN产生能量的10-20%

* [Do AGN triggering mechanisms vary with radio power? I.Optical morphologies of radio-intermediate HERGs](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.01315)
  * we use deep optical imaging data to study the detailed host morphologies of a complete sample of 30 local radio AGNs with high-excitation optical emission (HERG) spectra and intermediate radio powers
  * 其中有并合和相互作用迹象的比 2 Jy radio-powerful galaxies比例要低
  * The most radio-powerful half of the sample has a higher frequency of morphological disturbance than the least radio-powerful half
  * This suggests that the importance of triggering nuclear activity in HERGs through mergers and interactions reduces with radio power.

* [Photometry of high-redshift blended galaxies using deep learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.01324)
  * **Interesting**
  * This work explores the use of deep neural networks to estimate the photometry of blended pairs of galaxies in monochrome space images, similar to the ones that will be delivered by the Euclid space telescope
  * 利用CANDELS样本里的孤立星系，形成blend星系的training sample
  * We show that our approach can recover the original photometry of the galaxies before being blended with ∼7% accuracy without any human intervention and without any assumption on the galaxy shape.
  * We also show that forcing the network to simultaneously estimate a binary segmentation map results in a slightly improved photometry

* [The Dust and Molecular Gas in the Brightest Cluster Galaxy in MACS 1931.8-2635](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.01377)
  * **Relevant**
  * ALMA观测BCG，揭示了 2x10^10 Msun的分子气体： We detect CO(1-0), CO(3-2), and CO(4-3) emission from both diffuse and compact molecular gas components that extend from the BCG center out to ∼30 kpc to the northwest
  * Due to the lack of morphological symmetry, we hypothesize that the ∼300 km s−1 velocity of the CO in the tail is not due to concurrent uplift by AGN jets, rather we may be observing the aftermath of a recent AGN outburst.
  * Continuum emission in Bands 6 and 7 arises from dust and is spatially coincident with young stars and nebular emission observed in the UV and optical.

* [A Wide and Deep Exploration of Radio Galaxies with Subaru HSC (WERGS). II. Physical Properties derived from the SED Fitting with Optical, Infrared, and Radio Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.01419)
  * HSC+FIRST看到的RG：For 1056 FIRST RGs at 0< z ≤ 1.7 with HSC counterparts in about 100 deg2, we compiled multi-wavelength data of optical, near-infrared (IR), mid-IR, far-IR, and radio (150 MHz).
  * Since optically-faint (iAB≥21.3) RGs that are newly discovered by our RG survey tend to be high redshift, they tend to not only have a large dust extinction and low stellar mass but also have high SFR and AGN luminosity, high IR luminosity, and high Eddington ratio compared to optically-bright ones.

* [Variability of Low-ionization Broad Absorption Line Quasars Based on Multi-epoch Spectra from The Sloan Digital Sky Survey](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.01573)
  * We present absorption variability results for 134 bona fide \mgii\ broad absorption line (BAL) quasars at 0.46~≲z≲~2.3 covering days to ∼ 10 yr in the rest frame 样本来自SDSS，还是目前最大的BAL QSO样本
  * We find a remarkable time-dependent asymmetry in EW variation from the sample, such that weakening troughs outnumber strengthening troughs, the first report of such a phenomenon in BAL variability.
  * 低电离的BAL QSO吸收线变化不是那么频繁：The frequency of BAL variability is significantly lower (typically by a factor of 2) than that from high-ionization BALQSO samples
  * BAL absorbers tend to have relatively high optical depths and small covering factors along our line of sight
  * These observational results can be explained by a combined transverse-motion/ionization-change scenario, where transverse motions likely dominate the strengthening BALs while ionization changes and/or other mechanisms dominate the weakening BALs.

* [Beyond the Solar Circle − Trends in Massive Star Formation Between the Inner and Outer Galaxy](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.01714)
  * We present a new UC HII region catalogue that more than doubles the original sample size of previous work, totaling 536 embedded HII regions and 445 host clumps.
  * We find a significant trend showing that Lbol/M decreases with increasing RGC, suggesting that the overall star formation per unit mass is less in the outer Galaxy.

* [Near- to mid-infrared spectroscopy of the heavily obscured AGN LEDA 1712304 with AKARI/IRC](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.01831)
  * We study the infrared (IR) spectral properties of circumnuclear silicate dust in LEDA 1712304
  * The best-fit model indicates 0.1 μm-sized porous amorphous olivine (Mg2xFe2−2xSiO4; x=0.4) with 4% crystalline pyroxene.
  * The silicate dust in the AGN torus of LEDA 1712304 has properties notably similar to those in other AGNs as a whole, but slightly different in the wing shape of the absorption profile.
  * The porosity of the silicate dust suggests dust coagulation or processing in the circumnuclear environments, while the crystallinity suggests that the silicate dust is relatively fresh.

* [ALMA captures feeding and feedback from the active galactic nucleus in NGC613](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.01979)
  * The morphology of CO(3-2) line emission reveals a 2-arm trailing nuclear spiral at r≲100pc and a circumnuclear ring at ~350pc radius, that is coincident with the star-forming ring seen in the optical images.
  * The kinematics in the nuclear region is very skewed.
  * The nuclear spectrum of CO and dense gas tracers HCN(4-3), HCO+(4-3), and CS(7-6) show broad wings up to ±300km/s, associated with a molecular outflow emanating from the nucleus (r~25pc).
  * The outflow is mainly boosted by the AGN through entrainment by the radio jet, but given the weak nuclear activity of NGC613, we might be witnessing a fossil outflow, resulted from a strong past AGN that now has already faded.

* [An evolving and mass dependent σsSFR-M⋆ relation for galaxies](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.02023)
  * We employ the EAGLE simulations to study the dependence of the σsSFR of galaxies on stellar mass (M⋆) through the σsSFR-M⋆ relation in z∼0−4. Scatter对红移和恒星质量都有依赖
  * The models point to an evolving U-shape form for the σsSFR-M⋆ relation with the scatter being minimal at a characteristic mass M⋆ of 10^9.5 M⊙ and increasing both at lower and higher masses.
  * We find that active galactic nuclei feedback is important for increasing the σsSFR for high mass objects. 小质量端则是SN Feedback的作用，主要是增加了给定质量上SFH的diversity
  * We also find that excluding galaxies that have experienced recent mergers does not significantly affect the σsSFR-M⋆ relation.

* [Proximate Molecular Quasar Absorbers: Excess of damped H2 systems at zabs~zQSO in SDSS DR14](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.02040)
  * A search for strong H2 absorption systems proximate to quasars (zabs~zem) in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) Data Release 14 based on the Lyman-Werner band signature of damped H2 absorption lines without any prior on the associated metal or neutral hydrogen content.
  * Detection of 81 systems with log N(H2)~19-20 located within a few thousand km/s from the quasar.
  * The most striking feature of the proximate systems compared to the intervening ones is the presence of Ly-alpha emission in the core of the associated damped HI absorption line in about half of the sample.
  * we show that the presence of H2 helps to break the degeneracy between density and strength of the UV field as main sources of excitation and hence provides unique constraints on the possible origin and location of the absorbing clouds.

* [Modelling the tightest relation between galaxy properties and dark matter halo properties from hydrodynamical simulations of galaxy formation](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.01612)
  * **Relevant**
  * 在EAGLE, Illustrius, and IllustrisTNG模拟里，看哪个星系性质和Halo相关最好，考虑了各种类型的星系
  * We find that the stellar mass of a galaxy at the epoch of the peak circular velocity with an evolution correlation gives the tightest such correlation to the peak circular velocity Vpeak of the galaxy's underlining dark matter halo.
  * We show that the size of scatter predicted by hydrodynamical simulations has a negligible impact on the clustering of dense Vpeak-selected subhalo samples from simulations

### May 7

* [Hyper Wide Field Imaging of the Local Group Dwarf Irregular Galaxy IC 1613: An Extended Component of Metal-poor Stars](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.02210)
  * **Interesting**
  * HSC观测：Here we present g and i photometry of resolved stars in the isolated Local Group dwarf irregular galaxy IC 1613
  * 测量年轻主序星，中等-老年红巨星，老年水平支恒星：extend out to ∼24′ (∼5.2 kpc; 5 half-light radii), with the older populations best fit by a broken exponential in these outer regions
  * Comparing with earlier studies sensitive to IC 1613's inner regions shows that the stellar density of the old stellar populations steepens substantially with distance from the center 有效面亮度一直到了 g~33.7 mag/arcsec^2
  * Conversely, the distribution of younger stars follows a single, shallow exponential profile in the outer regions, demonstrating different formation channels for the younger and older components of IC 1613.

* [A new empirical method to estimate the molecular gas mass in galaxies](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.02214)
  * 用尘埃消光和经验关系测量：a tight correlation between the dust extinction, traced by the Balmer Decrement (BD=Hα/Hβ), the CO(1-0) line luminosity (LCO) and total molecular gas mass (MH2) in a sample of 222 local star-forming galaxies drawn from the xCOLD GASS survey.
  * 侧向盘引起的饱和效应需要改正：the galaxy disk inclination affects the correlation by inducing a saturation of the Balmer decrement on highly inclined galaxies
  * We do not find any dependence on galaxy size, mass, morphology, star formation activity, and gas metallicity. The correlation disappears if the atomic gas phase is considered.

* [New Horizon: On the origin of the stellar disk and spheroid of field galaxies](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.02216)
  * 用NewHorizon数值模拟：New Horizon, we explore kinematically decomposed disk and spheroidal components of 144 field galaxies with masses greater than 10^9M⊙ at z=0.7
  * 同样把恒星分成了不同的起源：in-situ vs. ex-situ
  * Before disk settling, stars form mainly through chaotic mergers between proto-galaxies and become part of the spheroidal component.
  * When disk settling starts, we find that more massive galaxies begin to form disk stars from earlier epochs; massive galaxies commence to develop their disks at z∼1−2, while low-mass galaxies do after z∼1.
  * A significant fraction of the spheroids comes from the disk stars that are perturbed, which becomes more important at lower redshifts.

* [Formation histories of stars, clusters and globular clusters in the E-MOSAICS simulations](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.02217)
  * **Relevant**
  * Zoom-in模拟：We find that the median lookback time of GC formation in these galaxies is ∼10.73 Gyr (z=2.1), roughly 2.5 Gyr earlier than that of the field stars
  * The epoch of peak GC formation is mainly determined by the time evolution of the maximum cluster mass, which depends on the galactic environment and largely increases with the gas pressure. 恒星形成和GC形成是同时进行的。
  * The metal-poor GCs (−2.5<[Fe/H]<−1.5) of our galaxies are older than the metal-rich GC subpopulation (−1.0<[Fe/H]<−0.5), forming 12.13 Gyr and 10.15 Gyr ago (z=3.7 and z=1.8), respectively.
  * The median ages of GCs are found to decrease gradually with increasing metallicity, which suggests different GC metallicity subpopulations do not form independently and their spatial and kinematic distributions are the result of their evolution in the context of hierarchical galaxy formation and evolution

* [Understanding extreme quasar optical variability with CRTS: II. Changing-state quasars](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.02262)
  * Search for quasars in the Catalina Real-time Transient Survey
  * We identify 73 sources with specific patterns of optical and mid-IR photometric behavior and a defined spectroscopic change. These "Changing-State" quasars (CSQs) form a higher luminosity sample to complement existing sets of "Changing-Look" AGN and quasars in the literature.
  * We find that this population of extreme varying quasars is associated with changes in the Eddington ratio and the timescales imply cooling/heating fronts propagating through the disk

* [On the primordial specific frequency of globular clusters in dwarf and giant elliptical galaxies](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.02723)
  * We devise a theoretical model for the specific frequency (SN,th). GC erosion is considered to be an important aspect for shaping this relation, since observations show that galaxies with low densities have a higher SN, while high density galaxies have a small SN.
  * We construct a model based on the hypothesis that star-formation is clustered and depends on the minimum embedded star cluster mass (Mecl,min), the slope of the power-law embedded cluster mass function (beta) and the relation between the star formation rate (SFR) and the maximum star cluster mass (Mecl,max).

* [Slowing down of cosmic growth of supermassive black holes: Theoretical prediction of the Eddington ratio distribution](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.02732)

  * These results indicate the "slowing down" of cosmic growth of supermassive black holes: the growth of supermassive black holes with a higher Eddington ratio peaks at higher redshift.

  * We calculate the thickness of stellar and HI disks in terms of half-width at half-maximum of vertical density distribution in a region of R=0 to 12 kpc
  * We obtain a mildly increasing disk thickness up to R=6 kpc, in a fairly good agreement with observations, and predict a strong flaring beyond that.
  * We also show that a compact and dense halo as implied by the observed rotation curve is needed to explain this trend. Interestingly both the stellar and HI disks show flaring at outer disk region despite being dynamically dominated by the dark matter halo from the very inner radii.

* [Black Hole -- Galaxy Correlations in Simba](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.02741)
  * Simba grows black holes via gravitational torque-limited accretion from cold gas and Bondi accretion from hot gas, while feedback from black holes is modeled in radiative and jet modes depending on the Eddington ratio (fEdd).
  * For MBH<∼10^8M⊙, fEdd is anti-correlated with MBH since the BHAR is approximately independent of MBH, while at higher masses fEdd−MBH flattens and has a larger scatter.
  * BHAR vs. SFR is invariant with redshift, but fEdd drops steadily with time at a given MBH, such that all but the most massive black holes are accreting in a radiatively efficient mode at z>∼2.
  * The black hole mass function amplitude decreases with redshift and is locally dominated by quiescent galaxies for MBH>108M⊙, but for z>∼1 star forming galaxies dominate at all MBH.
  * z=0的Eddington ratio分布基本是log-Normal的，peak在 f_Edd < 0.01的位置

  * 半解析模型：provide self-consistent predictions of the infrared excess (IRX) - β relations and cosmic star formation rate density.
  * A Bayesian approach is employed to statistically calibrate model free parameters including star formation efficiency, mass loading factor, dust optical depths and reddening slope directly against UV luminosity functions and colour-magnitude relations at z ~ 4 - 7.
  * We calculate IRX using energy balance arguments, and find that the large intrinsic scatter in the IRX -β plane is driven by the specific star formation rate.

* [Initial results from a systematic search for changing-look active galactic nuclei selected via mid-infrared variability](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.02904)
  * We propose an effective method to select CL candidates from spectroscopic quasar catalogs using the mid-infrared (MIR) variability information derived from ALL-WISE/NEOWISE data releases.
  * Our primary selection criteria include both a large amplitude flux variation and a transition of MIR color from an AGN to a normal galaxy.
  * A pilot spectroscopic follow-up of 7 candidates among about 300 candidates selected from Sloan Digital Sky Survey low-redshift (z<0.5) AGN sample results in 6 new turn-off CL AGNs.

* [Modeling the spectral energy distributions of super-Eddington quasars](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.02920)
  * This is based on the slim disc emissivity, where radial advection keeps the surface luminosity at the local Eddington limit, resulting in L(r)~/r^2 rather than the 1/r^3 expected from the Novikov-Thorne (standard, sub-Eddington) disc emissivity
  * We assume that the flow is radially stratified, with an outer standard disc, an inner hot Comptonising region and an intermediate warm Comptonising region to produce the soft X-ray excess.

* [The Main Sequence at z∼1.3 contains a sizable fraction of galaxies with compact star formation sizes: a new population of early post-starbursts?](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.02958)
  * **Interesting**
  * ALMA measurements for 93 Herschel-selected galaxies at 1.1⩽z⩽1.7 in COSMOS reveal a sizable (>29\%) population with compact star formation (SF) sizes, lying on average >×3.6 below the optical stellar mass (M⋆)-size relation of disks.
  * These compact galaxies have instead normally extended Kband sizes, suggesting strong specific SFR gradients.
  * 这些星系占了M*>10^11 Msun星系以上的 50%: We suggest that compact MS objects are early post-starburst galaxies in which the merger-driven boost of SF has subsided.
  * The presence of large galaxies above the MS demonstrates an overall poor correlation between galaxy SF size and specific SFR.

  * **Relevant**
  * A sample of approximately two thousand satellites of massive galaxies is carefully selected within a relatively narrow redshift range (0.07 < z < 0.14).
  * Two main parameters are considered as major drivers of the star formation history of these galaxies, namely: the stellar velocity dispersion of the satellite (σ), as a proxy of "local" drivers, and the ratio between the stellar mass of the satellite and the primary, μ=MSAT/MPRI, meant to serve as an indicator of environment.
  * We find that satellites around the most massive primaries appear older, at fixed velocity dispersion, with respect to satellites of lower mass primaries.

* [Prospects for Recovering Galaxy Intrinsic Shapes from Projected Quantities](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.03306)
  * **rRelevant**
  * Theoretical work using analytical galaxy potentials suggests a relationship between galaxy intrinsic shape (as defined by its "triaxiality", in practice a proxy for how prolate a galaxy is) and the intrinsic misalignment angle between kinematic and morphological axes (Ψint).
  * 在Illustris里面看：The strongest relationship we find is that galaxy intrinsic flattening is correlated with specific angular momentum (j) with high j galaxies being flatter than galaxies with low specific angular momentum.
  * Although the majority of kinematically misaligned galaxies exhibit prolate shapes, examples of kinematically aligned prolate galaxies are also present.
  * We demonstrate that the assumption of a simple relationship between Ψint and intrinsic shape commonly employed in shape recovery studies is not valid for Illustris galaxies

  * Regarding the dynamical state of the host galaxies, we find that the majority of the QSO2 show v/σ < 1, implying that they are dominated by random motions (so-called dispersion-dominated systems).

* [Non-Gaussianity in the Weak Lensing Correlation Function Likelihood - Implications for Cosmological Parameter Biases](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.03779)
  * We study the significance of non-Gaussianity in the likelihood of weak lensing shear two-point correlation functions, detecting significantly non-zero skewness and kurtosis in one-dimensional marginal distributions of shear two-point correlation functions in simulated weak lensing data though the full multivariate distributions are relatively more Gaussian.
  * We also present a systematic approach to constructing an approximate multivariate likelihood function by decorrelating the data points using principal component analysis (PCA). When using a subset of the PCA components that account for the majority of the cosmological signal as a data vector, the one-dimensional marginal likelihood distributions of those components exhibit less skewness and kurtosis than the original shear correlation functions.

  * The modeled scenario also reproduces the Magellanic Bridge, including the offset between young and old stars, and the collision between the Clouds, which is responsible of the very elongated morphology of the Small Magellanic Cloud along the line of sight.

  * The young-intermediate SP (100 < age ≤ 700 Myr) is distributed in a ring-shaped structure at ≈140 pc from the nucleus, which is roughly coincident with the lowest values of the stellar velocity dispersion.
  * In the inner ≈115 pc the old SP (age>2 Gyr) is dominant.

  * We identified nine sources with erroneous RM values due to nπ-ambiguity and 11 with reliable RM values.
  * We devised a measure of how much a source's RM deviates from that of its neighbours: Δ/σ, which we found to be a good diagnostic of nπ-ambiguity.

We found that two unpolarised sources were reported as polarised at about 0.5% level in the RM catalogue, and noted significant differences between our newly derived RM values and the catalogue values for the remaining 21 sources.
  * 这是 off-axis instrumental polarisation的影响: on average the RM uncertainties in the catalogue have to be increased by ≈ 10% to account for the off-axis instrumental polarisation effect.

* [Hot Dust-Obscured Galaxies with Excess Blue Light](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.04320)

  * CRs have relatively weak effects on all galaxy properties studied in dwarfs, or at high redshifts (z≳1−2), for any physically-reasonable parameters.
  * 但是在大质量和低红移处，如果effective diffusion coefficient比较高，CR可以抑制SF by factors ~ 2-4.
  * At lower κ, CRs take too long to escape dense star-forming gas and lose energy to hadronic collisions, producing negligible effects on galaxies and violating empirical constraints from γ-ray emission.

  * We developed new techniques to remove Galactic contamination (including evidence for CO(2-1) line emission) from the extragalactic catalog, providing a catalog of 321 Galactic sources in addition to the extragalactic catalog.
  * The DSFG spectra depart from the Rayleigh-Jeans regime of an optically thin modified blackbody between 218 GHz and 277 GHz, consistent with optically thick emission.
  * For AGN with 148 and 218 GHz flux density > 50 mJy, we estimate the inter-year RMS fractional deviation in flux density due to source variability to be 40%.
  * Our DSFG counts probe both the brighter, lensed population and the fainter, unlensed population.

* [The Brightest Galaxies at Cosmic Dawn from Scatter in the Galaxy Luminosity versus Halo Mass Relation](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.04848)
  * We model the UVLF over cosmic history with a semi-empirical framework and include a log-normal scatter, Σ, in galaxy luminosities with a conditional luminosity function approach.
  * We show that stochasticity induces a flattening or a feedback scale in the median galaxy luminosity versus halo mass relation, Lc(Mh) to account for the increase of bright objects placed in lower mass halos.
  * We observe a natural broadening in the bright-end exponential segment of the UVLF for z>6 if processes that regulate star-formation acts on the same mass scale as at z∼5, where the degree of broadening is enhanced for larger Σ.
  * Alternatively, if the bright-end feedback is triggered at a near-constant luminosity threshold, the feedback threshold occurs at progressively lower halo masses with increasing redshift, due to galaxies being more luminous on average at a fixed halo mass from rapid halo assembly.

  * This brings our sample of probable z~9-11 galaxy candidates over the CANDELS+ERS fields to 19 sources in total, equivalent to 1 candidate per 47 arcmin^2 (1 per 10 WFC3/IR fields).
  * UVLF在z>8演化很快：Based on this expanded sample, we obtain a more robust LF at z~9 and improved constraints on the volume density of bright z~9 and z~10 galaxies. Our improved z~9-10 results again reinforce previous findings for strong evolution in the UV LF at z>8, with a factor of ~10 evolution seen in the luminosity density from z~10 to z~8.

  * 用模拟看和高红移dwarf星系有关的吸收特征：Our goal is to explore whether the progenitors of the lowest mass dwarf galaxies known to harbor neutral hydrogen today (M_star~10^6 solar mass, M_halo=4x10^9 solar mass) could possibly be detected as Damped Lyman-alpha Absorbers (DLAs) over cosmic time.
  * We find that the progenitors of the simulated dwarf are expected to be seen for most of their evolution as DLAs that are contaminated by normal, Population~II, stars.
  * 只有在z>6才可能看到单纯被Pop-III增丰的DLA

  * PMN J0948+0022 is an archetype of gamma-ray-emitting NLS1s in AGN
  * The new VLA images reveal an outermost radio emission separated by 9.1 arcsec. Its resolved structure and steep spectrum suggest a terminal shock in a radio lobe energized by the jet from the PMN J0948+0022 nucleus.
  * This large-scale radio component is found at almost the same position angle as that of the pc-scale jet, indicating a stable jet direction up to ~1 Mpc.

  * 在一个特定的尘埃颗粒尺度上，如果辐射压够强是可以的：we find that dust grains with radii a∼0.1 μm successfully escape from the galactic disc if the ongoing star formation episode converts more than 15 per cent of the baryon content into stars and lasts ≳30 Myr, while larger and smaller grains are trapped in the disc because of gravity and gas drag

  * We show how the FMR emerges from the local anti-correlation between SFR surface density and Zg recently observed to exist in disk galaxies.

  * There is evidence for a decrement in the CO (1−0) surface brightness at the location of the host galaxy, which may indicate radiative feedback from the AGN, or offset star formation.
  * The intrinsic CO line luminosities are comparable to those of unobscured AGN and dusty star-forming galaxies at similar redshifts, but the infrared luminosities are lower, suggesting that the targets are less efficient at forming stars.

  * At low density the emission is primarily due to fluorescent re-emission of the ionising UV background due to recombinations, while collisional excitations dominate at higher densities.

  * It appears that the centre of IC 860 is in a phase of rapid evolution where an inflow is building up the nuclear column density of gas. A slow, dense outflow may be signalling the onset of feedback.

  * We find the BLFs depend on the projected distance dp between pair members. At large separation dp>150h−1 kpc, the BLF degenerates into a luminosity function (LF) of single galaxies, indicating few interactions between pair members
  * At 100h−1 kpc≤dp≤150h−1 kpc, the BLF starts to show the correlation between pair members, in the sense that the shape of the conditional luminosity function (CLF) of one member galaxy starts to depend on the luminosity of the other member galaxy.
  * the CLF with a brighter companion has a steeper faint-end slope, which becomes even more significant at 50h−1 kpc≤dp≤100h−1 kpc.

  * we directly measure the amount of pseudo evolution of a SO mass of cluster-sized dark matter halo by the change of reference density from time series of N-body simulation for the first time.
  * 对z=0处10^14 Msun的cluster：We find that 48±14% of difference in virial SO mass between z=0 and 1 is accounted by the pseudo evolution for clusters
  * The amount of pseudo evolution of SO mass is found to be correlated with the age and the density environment of galaxy cluster.
  * We discuss how more concentrated clusters can have a larger clustering amplitude than less concentrated counterparts and argue the presence of rich filamentary structures plays a critical role in determining the linear halo bias of galaxy clusters.

* [Suppressing the thermal SZ-induced variance in CMB-cluster lensing estimators](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.07943)
  * 利用CMB lensing的SZ效应测量星系团质量需要考虑cluster自身的tSZ效应的影响
  * Quadratic lensing estimators use a pair of maps to extract the lensing signal: a large scale gradient map and a small scale lensing map. The SZ bias can be eliminated by using an SZ-free map in the pair
  * However, while this approach eliminates the bias, the SZ power in small scale lensing map adds extra variance that can become significant for high mass clusters and low noise surveys.
  * we propose projecting out an SZ template to reduce the SZ variance. Any residual SZ signal after template fitting is uncorrelated with the SZ-free gradient map, and thus does not bias the mass measurements.

  * Follow the interstellar medium (ISM) thermo-chemical non-equilibrium evolution, and perform on-the-fly radiative transfer of the interstellar radiation field (ISRF).
  * 对模拟结果再处理，估计FIR发射线的强度 [CII], [NII], [OIII]
  * At z=8, the most massive galaxy, `Freesia', has an age t⋆≃409Myr, stellar mass M⋆≃4.2×10^9M⊙, and a star formation rate SFR≃11.5M⊙yr−1, due to a recent burst
  * The resulting ionising escape fraction from Freesia is fesc≃2%. While [CII] emission is extended (radius 1.54 kpc), [OIII] is concentrated in Freesia-A (0.85 kpc)
  * As many high-z galaxies, Freesia lies below the local [CII]-SFR relation. We show that this is the general consequence of a starburst phase
  * Metallicity has a sub-dominant impact on the amplitude of [CII]-SFR deviations.

* [Galactic r-process abundance feature shaped by radial migration](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.08275)
  * We show that radial migration of stars across the Galactic disk plays a crucial role in shaping the r-process abundance feature in the solar vicinity 恒星的径向迁移过程对r过程元素丰度的分布很重要
  * we highlight the importance of migration from the outer disk where [r-process/Fe] of some old stars is predicted to be enhanced to the level beyond the expectation from the observed Galactic Fe and Eu radial gradient, which results in a large span of [r-process/Fe] among nearby disk stars.
  * The variation in the [r-process/Fe] ratio seen across the Galactic disk as well as in dwarf galaxies may be an outcome of different stellar initial mass functions which change the occurrence frequency between supernovae leaving behind neutron stars and ones ending with black holes.

* [He abundances in disc galaxies - I. Predictions from cosmological chemodynamical simulations](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.08254)
  * We investigate how the stellar and gas-phase He abundances evolve as functions of time within three simulated star-forming disc galaxies
  * 三个星系的SFH不同，The predicted relations between the He mass fraction, Y, and the metallicity, Z, in the interstellar medium of our simulated disc galaxies depend on the past galaxy star formation history.
  * we find that dY/dZ is not constant and evolves as a function of time, depending on the specific chemical element that we choose to trace Z 比如用C，N，O。
  * Interestingly, dY/dXC+N evolves very weakly, being always in the range ≈[6.4,6.6].
  * Predict negative radial gradients for the gas-phase He abundances in our simulated disc galaxies, due to the galaxy inside-out growth as a function of time, which gives rise to longer chemical enrichment time scales in the outer galaxy regions, where we find lower average values for Y and Z.

* [Formation of disc galaxies around z~2](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.08432)
  * The fraction of 2-component (bulge+disc) systems increases from ~46% for z>2 to ~70% for z<2, compensating for the fall in population of pure discs and pure spheroids.
  * All quiescent outliers of our full sample on the main-sequence, are 2-component systems, belonging to the lower redshift range (z<2).
  * The doubling of stellar mass of 2-component systems and decrease in their SFR by the same factor, suggests that mechanisms
  * Interestingly, while there is substantial increase in the size (~2.5 times) and mass (~5 times) of pure discs, from z>2 to z<2, pure spheroids maintain roughly the same values. Additionally, while bulge hosting discs witness an expansion in scale length (~1.3 times), their bulge sizes as well as bulge to total light ratio see no evolution, suggesting that z~2 is pre-dominantly a disc formation period.

  * We also explore the prior distributions of microlensing time-delay potentially affecting the cosmological time-delay measurements of WFI2033-4723. There is however no strong indication in our measurements that microlensing time delay is neither present nor absent.

* [2MTF - VII. 2MASS Tully-Fisher survey final data release: distances for 2,062 nearby spiral galaxies](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.08530)
  * The final 2MTF catalogue contains 2,062 nearby spiral galaxies in the CMB frame velocity range of 600 km s−1 < cz <10,000 km s−1 with a mean velocity of 4,805 km s−1.
  * The mean uncertainties of the linear distance measurements are around 22\% in all three infrared bands. 2MTF measurements agree well with the distances from the Cosmicflows-3 compilation, which contains 1,117 common galaxies, including 28 with SNIa distance measurements.

* [Towards determining the neutrino mass hierarchy: weak lensing and galaxy clustering forecasts with baryons and intrinsic alignments](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.08754)
  * **Interesting**
  * 能不能用Stage IV的lensing巡天测量中微子质量和以及区分 mass hierarchies很大程度上依赖于能否足够好的描述小尺度上的重子物理过程以及intrinsic alignment
  * For a Euclid-like survey, we perform the first combined weak lensing and galaxy clustering Fisher analysis with baryons, intrinsic alignments, and massive neutrinos for both hierarchies.
  * For weak lensing, we find that baryons cause severe degradation to forecasts of the neutrino mass sum, Σ, approximately doubling σΣ. We show that including galaxy clustering constraints from Euclid and BOSS, and cosmic microwave background (CMB) Planck priors, can reduce this degradation to σΣ to 9% and 16% for the normal and inverted hierarchies respectively.
  * The effect of intrinsic alignments on forecasts is shown to be minimal, with σΣ even experiencing mild improvements due to information from the intrinsic alignment signal.

* [The shape of the Photon Transfer Curve of CCD sensors](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.08677)
  * The Photon Transfer Curve (PTC) of a CCD depicts the variance of uniform images as a function of their average.
  * It is now well established that the variance is not proportional to the average, as Poisson statistics would indicate, but rather flattens out at high flux. This `variance deficit', related to the brighter-fatter effect, feeds correlations between nearby pixels, that increase with flux, and decay with distance.
  * We propose an analytical expression for the PTC shape, and for the dependence of correlations with intensity, and relate both to some more basic quantities related to the electrostatics of the sensor, that are commonly used to correct science images for the brighter-fatter effect.

  * Our new catalog, complemented with literature data, more than doubles the number of known galaxy spectroscopic redshifts in the direct vicinity of the lens, expanding to 116 (64) the number of spectroscopic redshifts for galaxies separated by less than 3 arcmin (2 arcmin) from the lens.
  * Using the flexion-shift as a measure of the amplitude of the gravitational perturbation, we identify 2 galaxy groups and 3 galaxies that require specific attention in the lens models.

* [Fast and inefficient star formation due to short-lived molecular clouds and rapid feedback](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.08801)
  * **Interesting**
  * The key question is why the timescale for depleting molecular gas through star formation in galaxies (tdep≈2 Gyr) exceeds the dynamical timescale of GMCs by two orders of magnitude.
  * we report our observation that molecular gas and star formation are spatially de-correlated on GMC scales in the nearby flocculent spiral galaxy NGC300, contrary to their tight correlation on galactic scales
  * We demonstrate that this de-correlation implies rapid evolutionary cycling between GMCs, star formation, and feedback.
  * star formation is regulated by efficient stellar feedback, driving GMC dispersal on short timescales (~1.5 Myr) due to radiation and stellar winds, prior to supernova explosions
  * 由于feedback非常强，GMC的寿命只在一个动力学时标作用，就是10Myr左右; SF效率也只有2-3%

  * We measure an asymmetric variation of the degree of polarization across the torus equatorial axis with a peak polarization of 2.2±0.3%
  * 用一个 magnetically aligned dust grains assuming a toroidal magnetic field and homogeneous grain alignment 的模型去理解观测

  * 超分辨率模型模拟多相气体结构，自洽的产生外流：implements crucial aspects of stellar feedback including photoionization, radiation pressure, energy and momentum injection from stellar winds and from supernovae
  * Stellar feedback regulates star formation to the observed level and naturally captures the establishment of a Kennicutt-Schmidt relation.
  * Gaseous outflows are generated with average mass loading factors of the order of unity. Strong outflow activity is correlated with peaks in the star formation history of the galaxy with evidence that most of the ejected gas eventually rains down onto the disc in a galactic fountain flow that sustains late-time star formation.

  * Comparing our results to photoionization models, the CIII] equivalent width (WCIII]=16.23±2.32\AA), low SiIII]/CIII] ratio, and high implied [OIII] equivalent width (from the Spitzer/IRAC [3.6]−[4.5]≃0.8 mag color) require sub-Solar metallicities (Z≃0.1−0.2Z⊙) and a high ionization parameter
  * 更倾向于那些能产生更多高电离辐射的模型：These results favor models that produce higher ionization, such as the BPASS models for the photospheres of high-mass stars, and that include both binary stellar populations and/or an IMF that extends to 300 M⊙.

  * 三个系统的星系都是有物理联系的，而且都位于某种overdensity区域：Therefore, we report the discovery of two new gas-rich dusty protocluster cores (HELAISS02, z=2.171±0.004; HXMM20, z=2.602±0.002). The third target is located in the well known COSMOS overdensity at z=2.51
  * From the gas, dust, and stellar properties of the two new protocluster cores, we find very large molecular gas fractions yet low stellar masses, pushing the sources above the main sequence, while not enhancing their star formation efficiency.

  * Our outer pointing confirms the near-uniform old ages and the presence of a steep metallicity gradient, but with no evidence for anomalously high metallicity values at large galactocentric radii.
  * We find a rising outer velocity dispersion profile and high values of the 4th-order kinematic moment -- an indicator of possible anisotropy.
  * With short exposures, we have been able to derive robust stellar kinematics and stellar populations in NGC 1407 to about 1 effective radius

  * Only ~30 per cent of optical AGN host galaxies are morphologically disturbed, indicating that recent interactions are not the dominant trigger.
  * 但MIR AGN中有相互作用痕迹的比例更高：Almost 60 per cent of mid-IR AGN hosts show signs of visual disturbance, indicating that interactions play a more significant role in nuclear feeding.

* [Globular Cluster Formation from Colliding Substructure](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.08951)
  * **Interesting**
  * Formation of Globular Clusters (GCs) is triggered by high-speed collisions between infalling atomic-cooling subhalos during the assembly of the main galaxy host, a special dynamical mode of star formation that operates at high gas pressures and is intimately tied to LCDM hierarchical galaxy assembly.
  * 两个相互碰撞的subhalo也会产生如子弹星系团那样的恒星和DM分离的效果：We find that the resulting shock-compressed layer cools on a timescale that is tipically shorter than the crossing time, first by atomic line emission and then via fine-structure metal-line emission, and is subject to gravitational instability and fragmentation.
  * 可以解释 GC质量和halo质量的相关；以及GC相比于星系更延展的空间分布
    * This is because, in an inelastic collision, the splash remnant will lose orbital energy and fall deeper into the Galactic potential rather than sharing the orbits of the progenitor subhalos

  * Provide the first characterisation of the spatially resolved properties of galaxies embedded in filaments in the local Universe.
  * The four galaxies we focus on show peculiar ionised gas distributions: Halpha clouds have been observed beyond four times the effective radius.
  * The gas kinematics, metallicity map and the ratios of emission line fluxes confirm that they do belong to the galaxy gas disk
  * The clouds are powered by star formation, and are characterised by intermediate values of dust absorption.
  * We hypothesise a scenario in which the observed features are due to "Cosmic Web Enhancement": we are most likely witnessing galaxies passing through or flowing within filaments that assist the gas cooling and increase the extent of the star formation in the densest regions in the circumgalactic gas.

* [GASP XIX: AGN and their outflows at the center of jellyfish galaxies](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.08972)

  * We report evidence for star formation quenching in the central 8.6 kpc region of the jellyfish galaxy JO201 which hosts an active galactic nucleus
  * The ultraviolet imaging data of the galaxy disk reveal a region with reduced flux around the center of the galaxy and a horse shoe shaped region with enhanced flux in the outer disk.
  * The CO J2−1 map of the galaxy disk reveals a cavity in the central region.

* [Morphological diversity of spiral galaxies originating in the cold gas inflow from cosmic webs](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.08993)
  * In the case of Milky Way, the previous study suggested that the cold accretion created its thick disc in early times and the cooling flow formed the thin disc in later epochs.
  * Here we report that extending this idea to galaxies with various masses and associating the hybrid accretion with the formation of bulges reproduces the observed mass-dependent structures of spiral galaxies: namely, more massive galaxies have lower thick disc mass fractions and higher bulge mass fractions

* [Comparison of Observed Galaxy Properties with Semianalytic Model Predictions using Machine Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.08996)
  * **Interesting**
  * We use a lightcone of semianalytic galaxies tuned to match CANDELS observations from Lu et al. (2014) to train a set of neural networks on a set of galaxy properties (stellar mass, metallicity, and average star formation rate) using the truth values from the semianalytic catalogs.
  * On semianalytic galaxies alone, we are nearly competitive with template-fitting methods
  * Our results show that stellar mass, metallicity, and star formation rate can in principle be measured with neural networks at a competitive degree of accuracy and precision relative to physically motivated template-fitting methods if an appropriate training set can be obtained.

* [New insights on the central stellar population and gas outflow in NGC 1068 from YJH spectroscopy with SPHERE/VLT](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.09208)
  * Dust and stars are the main contributors to the continuum, but scattered light from the central engine is also detected in the very central region.
  * The dust emission is well modeled by a 800K blackbody, is spatially unresolved and only located in the very central region.
  * Finally, the emission lines exhibit a significant doppler shift, consistent with a radial outflow from the nucleus in a biconical structure. The [Fe II] behaviour strongly differs from other lines, suggesting that it arises from a different structure.

* [Revealing the galaxy-halo connection in IllustrisTNG](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.08799)
  * **Relevant, Important**
  * 对TNG100和TNG300的星系进行HOD模型分析：we find that haloes located in dense environments, with low concentrations, later formation times, and high angular momenta are richest in their satellite population
  * At low mass, highly-concentrated haloes and those located in overdense regions are more likely to contain a central galaxy.
  * The degree of environmental dependence is sensitive to the definition adopted for the physical boundary of the host halo.
  * HODs predicted by halo mass and present-day concentration capture the qualitative dependence on the remaining halo properties
  * At fixed halo mass, concentration is a strong predictor of the stellar mass of the central galaxy, which may play a defining role in the fate of the satellite population.

  * Our overdensity search yielded 402 new overdensity candidates with precisely measured redshifts and an unprecedented sensitivity down to low total overdensity masses

  * Other methods (e.g., red-sequence overdensities and hot medium reliant detections) begin to fail at similar redshifts, which attests to VMC mapping's potential to be a powerful tool for current and future wide-field galaxy evolution surveys at z∼1 and beyond.

  * NGC 1566 has an asymmetric and mildly warped HI disc. The HI-to-stellar mass fraction of NGC 1566 is 0.29, which is high in comparison with galaxies that have the same stellar mass
  * We also derive the rotation curve of this galaxy to a radius of 50 kpc and fit different mass models to it. The NFW, Burkert and pseudo-isothermal dark matter halo profiles fit the observed rotation curve reasonably well and recover dark matter fractions of 0.62, 0.58 and 0.66

  * Our simulation does not reproduce the observed de-correlation between tracers of gas and star formation on < 100 pc scales 可能是因为在超新星爆发前的反馈作用不够强: which does not disperse the surrounding gas completely, leaving star formation tracer emission too strongly associated with molecular gas tracer emission

  * The z70-1 LAB shows the extended Lyα emission with a scale length of 1.4±0.2 kpc, about three times larger than the UV continuum emission, making z70-1 the most distant LAB identified to date.
  * LAB里面AGN的迹象很少：All of the 7 LABs, except z49-1, exhibit no AGN signatures such as X-ray emission, {\sc Nv}λ1240 emission, or Lyα line broadening, while z49-1 has a strong {\sc Civ}λ1548 emission line indicating an AGN
  * The Lyα scale lengths of the core (star-forming region) and the halo components are rc=0.6−1.2 kpc and rh=2.0−13.8 kpc, respectively.
  * r_h和Lya光度的关系与经验关系预期的接近，说明这些LAB可能代表的就是高红移SFR很高的那些“普通”星系

* [Resolved Molecular Gas and Star Formation Properties of the Strongly Lensed z=2.26 Galaxy SDSS J0901+1814](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.09845)
  * 1" resolution (~2 kpc in the source plane) observations of the CO(1-0), CO(3-2), Halpha, and [N II] lines in the strongly-lensed z=2.26 star-forming galaxy SDSS J0901+1814
  * SDSS J0901+1814 is a nearly face-on (i~30 degrees) massive disk with r_{1/2}>~4 kpc for its molecular gas. SFR和恒星质量符合main sequence
  * SDSS J0901+1814 is offset from "normal" star-forming galaxies to higher star formation efficiencies independent of assumptions for the CO-to-H_2 conversion factor.

* [A novel approach to study the variability of NGC 5548](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.10128)
  * We use a multifractality analysis technique called Multifractal Detrended Moving Average (MFDMA) analysis.
  * We detect multifractal (nonlinear) signatures in the full monitoring and densely sampled period of the Hβ line and 5100 {\AA} continuum light curves of NGC 5548, possibly indicating the presence of complex and nonlinear interaction in the 5100 {\AA} continuum and Hβ emission line regions.
  * the degree of multifractality of Hβ line is found to be about twice that of the 5100 {\AA} continuum.

* [Stellar systems following the R1/m luminosity law. III. Photometric, intrinsic and dynamical properties for all Sérsic indices](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.10359)
  * **Useful, Important**
  * In this study, we use a combination of numerical and analytical techniques to investigate the Sersic model over the entire range of Sersic parameters, focusing on the small m regime
  * For all values m<1, the model is characterised by a finite central luminosity density, and for m<12, even a central depression in the luminosity density profile.
  * 对运动学也有影响：we show that all Sersic models with m⩾12 can be supported by an isotropic velocity dispersion tensor, and that these isotropic models are stable to both radial and non-radial perturbations. The models with m<12, on the other hand, cannot be supported by an isotropic velocity dispersion tensor.

* [Multiwavelength cluster mass estimates and machine learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.09920)
  * **Relevant**
  * Here, machine learning is used in a simulation to instead directly combine five multiwavelength measurements to obtain cluster masses.
  * As machine learning relies upon the accuracy of the training set in capturing the observables, their correlations, and the observational selection function, and the training set originates from simulations, a few ways of testing whether a simulation and observations are consistent are explored as well

* [A Massive Cluster at z = 0.288 Caught in the Process of Formation: The Case of Abell 959](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.10156)
  * Using LOFAR Two-meter Sky Survey data, we present new detections of both a radio halo and a likely radio relic in A959
  * Using a sample of clusters with giant radio haloes from the literature (80 in total), we show that the radio halo in A959 lies reasonably well on the scaling relations between the thermal and non-thermal power of the system.
  * Steep-spectrum haloes tend to reside in clusters with high X-ray luminosities relative to those expected from cluster LM scaling relations, indicating that such systems may preferentially lie at an earlier stage of the merger, consistent with the theory that some steep-spectrum haloes result from low-turbulence mergers.
  * Halo systems containing radio relics tend to lie at lower X-ray luminosities, relative to those expected from cluster LM scaling relations, for a given halo radio power than those without relics, suggesting that the presence of relics indicates a later stage of the merger, in line with simulations.

* [Spatially Resolved Stellar Kinematics of the Ultra-Diffuse Galaxy Dragonfly 44: II. Constraints on Fuzzy Dark Matter](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.10373)
  * **Interesting**
  * Following up on new integral field unit spectroscopic observations and dynamics modeling of the DM-dominated ultra-diffuse galaxy Dragonfly 44 in the outskirts of the Coma Cluster, we present models of fuzzy DM constrained by the stellar dynamics of this galaxy.
  * We infer a scalar field mass of ∼3×10^−22 eV, consistent with other constraints from galaxy dynamics but in tension with constraints from Lyα forest power spectrum modeling.
  * 暂时无法去分普通CDM和FuzzyDM的区别：the inferred properties of the fuzzy DM halo satisfy a number of predictions for halos in a fuzzy DM cosmology.

* [Optically variable active galactic nuclei in the 3 yr VST survey of the COSMOS field](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.10374)

  * We demonstrate that the method allows the selection of high-purity (> 86%) samples. We take advantage of the longer observing baseline to achieve great improvement in the completeness of our sample with respect to X-ray and spectroscopically confirmed samples of AGNs (59%, vs. ~15% in our previous work) 样本纯度高，完备性和监测数据的时间覆盖有关

* [Bringing manifold learning and dimensionality reduction to SED fitters](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.10379)
  * **Interesting, Useful**
  * We use self organizing maps (SOMs) to visualize a spectral energy distribution (SED) model library in the observed photometry space.
    * The resulting visual maps allow for a better understanding of how the observed data maps to physical properties and to better optimize the model libraries for a given set of observational data.
  * The SOMs are used to estimate the physical parameters of 14,000 z~1 galaxies in the COSMOS field and found to be in agreement with those measured with SED fitting.

  * Discovery of the highest global [CII] excess with respect to the FIR luminosity in the nearby AGN host galaxy HE1353-1917.
  * 这个源的特殊之处在于：AGN ionization cone and radio jet directly intercept the cold galactic disk. 窄线区里“镶嵌”着一个多相喷流
  * A global [CII] excess in AGN host galaxies could be a direct signature of a multiphase AGN-driven outflow with a high mass-loading factor.

* [The Close AGN Reference Survey (CARS). A massive multi-phase outflow impacting the edge-on galaxy HE1353-1917](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.10385)
  * We detect a biconical extended narrow-line region (ENLR) ionized by the luminous AGN oriented nearly parallel to the galaxy disc, extending out to at least 25kpc.
  * 盘外的气体可能主要还是来自SF过程，而不是AGN的
  * A fast multi-phase AGN-driven outflow with speeds up to 1000km/s is detected close to the nucleus at 1kpc distance.
  * 因为AGN引起的SF负反馈证据不强，也仅限于中心1 kpc: 但是 the outflow has the potential to greatly impact the future evolution of the galaxy disc due to its geometrical orientation.
  * 即便是在射点宁静的类星体中，低能量的射点喷流也可能驱动告诉的多相星系尺度外流

* [Jet-driven galaxy-scale gas outflows in the hyper-luminous quasar 3C273](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.10387)
  * MUSE+ALMA观测Hyper luminous QSO原型 3C273的ENLR以及核心周围的分子气体
  * The ENLR size of 12.1±0.2kpc implies a smooth continuation of the size-luminosity relation out to large radii or a much larger break radius as previously proposed.
  * The kinematically disturbed ionized gas with line splits reaching 1000km/s out to 6.1±1.5kpc is aligned along the jet axis.
  * The extreme line broadening on kpc scales is caused by spatial and spectral blending of many distinct gas clouds separated on sub-arcsecond scales with different line-of-sight velocities.
  * 可能的解释：a pressurized expanding hot gas cocoon created by the radio jet is impacting on an inclined gas disk leading to transverse and/or backflow motion with respect to our line-of-sight.
  * Using 3C273 as a template for observations of high-redshift hyper-luminous AGN reveals that large-scale ENLRs and kpc scale outflows may often be missed due to the brightness of the nuclei

* [An extended catalog of galaxy-galaxy strong gravitational lenses discovered in DES using convolutional neural networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.10522)
  * We train two neural networks using images of simulated lenses, then use them to score postage stamp images of 7.9 million sources from the Dark Energy Survey chosen to have plausible lens colors based on simulations.
  * After including 86 candidates discovered in earlier searches using neural networks and 26 candidates discovered through visual inspection of blue-near-red objects in the DES catalog, we present a catalog of 511 lens candidates.

* [Connecting galaxy structure and star formation: the role of environment in formation of S0 galaxies](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.10739)
  * We find that the fraction of pseudobulge hosting disc galaxies decreases with increase in density.
  * The classical bulge hosting spirals and S0 galaxies follow a similar trend in less dense environments but towards higher densities, we observe an increase in the fraction of classical bulge host S0 galaxies at the expense of spirals
  * We surmise that the existence of more classical bulge hosting spirals galaxies and more efficient quenching leads to the observed increased occurrence of S0 galaxies in high density environments.

* [The complex case of MACSJ0717.5+3745 and its extended filament: intra-cluster light, galaxy luminosity function, and galaxy orientations](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.10816)
  * **Relevant, Interesting**
  * By analyzing the distribution and fractions of intra-cluster light (ICL) in the core of this cluster and by trying to detect intra-filament light (IFL) in the filament.
  * 看星系团核心区域和纤维结构里星系的光度函数；看先委区域里星系的指向: 光度函数有差别，但是星系在纤维结构内的指向没有明显的和纤维方向重合的证据：the GLFs in the filament are notably different from those of field galaxies, with a flatter faint end slope and an excess of bright galaxies. We do not detect a significant alignment of the galaxies in the filament region that was analyzed.
  * The spatial distribution of the ICL is determined with our new wavelet-based software, DAWIS.
  * We detect a large amount of ICL in the cluster core, but no IFL in the cosmic filament. The fraction of ICL in the core peaks in the F606W filter before decreasing with wavelength.

* [The morphological transformation and the quenching of galaxies](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.11008)
  * Both early type galaxies and late type galaxies are found to have bimodal distributions on the star formation rate versus stellar mass diagram 按这两个标准分成四组
  * We found that the morphological transformation is mainly regulated by the stellar mass.

* [Complex distribution and velocity field of molecular gas in NGC 1316 as revealed by Morita Array of ALMA](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.11085)
  * We reveal the detailed distribution of the molecular gas in the central region for the first time: a shell structure in the northwest, a barely resolved blob in the southeast of the center and some clumps between them.
  * 中心有大致5x10^8 Msu的分子气体；速度场显示了很大的扰动迹象，可能说明了分子气体来自外部，并正向一个盘上面settle
  * To explain these ratios, additional processes should be taken into accounts such as an effective dust formation and conversion from atomic to molecular gas during the interaction.

* [Molecular Gas Density Measured with H2CO and CS toward a Spiral Arm of M51](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.11087)
  * IRAM+NRO观测：Here we present sensitive measurements of the H2CO (101−000) line at 72 GHz toward giant molecular clouds (GMCs) in the spiral arm of M51
  * The derived H2 density indicates that the emission of H2CO and CS is not localized to star-forming cores, but is likely distributed over an entire region of GMCs.
  * Contributions from the widespread less-dense components should be taken into account for interpretation of these molecular emission observed with a GMC-scale resolution.

* [The molecular gas content of shell galaxies](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.11356)
  * **Interesting**
  * 看有没有可能通过分子气体观测得到shell的LOS速度: Some of the gas, the most diffuse and dissipative, is expected to be driven quickly to the center if it is travelling on nearly radial orbits. Molecular gas, distributed in dense clumps, is less dissipative, and may be associated to shells, and determine their velocity
  * IRAM观测6个shell星系：Six of them are detected in their galaxy center, and in three galaxies, we clearly detect molecular gas in shells.
  * For two of them (Arp~10 and NGC~3656), the shells are characteristic of an oblate system. Their velocity is nearly systemic, and we conclude that these shells are phase-wrapped.
  * For the third one (NGC~3934) the shells appear to participate to the rotation

* [Deconfusing intensity maps with neural networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.11376)
  * First application of convolutional neural network (CNN) to directly determine the underlying luminosity function of a LIM, including a treatment of extragalactic foregrounds and instrumental noise.
  * We find that, in the ideal case where the mock data capture all of the features of the real data, the CNN performs comparably to or better than conventional analyses. However, the network's accuracy degrades considerably when tested on signals and systematics outside of those it was trained on.

  * 再电离严重降低了从filament进入dwarfhalo的气体总量
  * Our simulations show that inflow suppression (i.e. starvation), rather than photoevaporation, is the dominant mechanism by which the baryonic content of high-redshift dwarf galaxies is regulated.
  * 在固定halo质量和红移上，dwarf中的气体比例scatter很大；而且，在再电离之后，一般都还可以继续形成恒星

* [A study of stellar orbit fractions: simulated IllustrisTNG galaxies compared to CALIFA observations](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.11415)
  * We find that the TNG100 simulation broadly reproduces the observed fractions of different orbital components and their stellar mass dependencies.
  * The simulation also largely reproduces the observed peak and trough features at a stellar mass of 1-2E10 solar masses, in the mean distributions of the cold- and hot-orbit fractions, respectively, indicating fewer cooler orbits and more hotter orbits in both more- and less-massive galaxies beyond such a mass range.
  * The average cold-orbit (counter-rotating) fractions of the simulated galaxies below (above) a stellar mass of 6E10 solar masses, are systematically higher than the observational data by < 10% (absolute orbital fraction)

* [The Molecular Gas Reservoirs of z∼2 Galaxies: A comparison of CO(1-0) and dust-based molecular gas masses](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.11417)
  * We recover a clear correlation between the rest-frame 850μm luminosity, inferred from the single-band, long-wavelength flux, and the CO(1-0) line luminosity, consistent with the samples used to perform the 850μm calibration. Rest-frame 850微米光度的到分子气体质量和CO得到的差别在一倍以内
  * We show that this factor of two uncertainty can arise from the values of the dust emissivity index and temperature that need to be assumed in order to extrapolate from the observed frequency to the rest-frame at 850μm.
  * We therefore conclude that single-band observations of long-wavelength dust emission can be used to reliably constrain the molecular gas masses of massive, star-forming galaxies at z≳2.

* [Effects of baryons on weak lensing peak statistics](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.11636)
  * We investigate the effects of baryons on the number of weak-lensing peaks in the convergence field.
  * 用Schneider et al. (2019)对density map进行改正: As a result we find that the baryonic effects strongly depend on the Gaussian smoothing applied to the convergence map.
  * Smaller smoothing scales lead to a significant suppression of high peaks with κ>0.2, while lower peaks are not affected.

* [Towards a Model-Independent Measurement of the Halo Mass Function with Observables](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.11886)
  * **Interesting**
  * We point out an interesting feature in the halo mass function of the concordence ΛCDM model: the total halo mass within each evenly-spaced logarithmic mass bin is approximately the same over a large mass range.
  * We show that this property allows us to construct an almost bias-free halo mass function using only an observable (as a halo mass estimator) and stacked weak lensing measurements as long as the scatter between the true halo mass and the observable-inferred mass has a stable form in logarithmic units

  * We apply an inverse-distance-ladder approach, combining strong-lensing time-delay-distance measurements with SN Ia data. By themselves, SNe Ia are merely good relative distance indicators, but by anchoring them to strong gravitational lenses one can obtain an H0 measurement that is relatively insensitive to other cosmological parameters.
  * In combination with SN Ia data, the inferred H0 consistently lies around 73-74 km s−1 Mpc−1, regardless of the assumed cosmological background model.
