* [The Effect of Minor and Major Mergers on the Evolution of Low Excitation Radio Galaxies](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.00018)
  * 用DECaLS图像做的：a sample of 282 Low Excitation Radio Galaxies (LERGs) at z<0.07
  * In groups and in the field, the LERG minor merger fraction is consistent with the control population.
  * In galaxy clusters, 8.8±2.9 % of LERGs show evidence of recent minor mergers in contrast to 23.0±2.0 % of controls. This ∼4σ deficit of minor mergers in cluster LERGs suggests these events may inhibit this type of nuclear activity for galaxies within the cluster environment.
  * 但LERG里的Major merger比例高：We observe a >4σ excess of major mergers in the LERGs with M∗≲10^11M⊙, with 10±1.5 % of these AGN involved in such large-scale interactions
  * This excess of major mergers in LERGs decreases with increasing stellar mass 在大质量星系里不存在

* [Star Formation Histories of the LEGUS Spiral Galaxies. I. The flocculent spiral NGC 7793](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.00020)
  * 分解星族的分析： We determine an average star formation rate (SFR) for the galaxy portion covered by our F555W and F814W data of 0.23 +- 0.02 Msun/yr over the whole Hubble time, corresponding to a total stellar mass of 3.09 +- 0.33 x 10^9 Msun in agreement with previous determinations.
  * We recover the resolved SFH in different radial regions of the galaxy; this shows an indication of a growing trend of the present-to-past SFR ratio, increasing from internal to more external regions, supporting previous findings of the inside-out growth of the galaxy.

* [80 minute light echo signalling a 10,000 solar mass black hole in a bulgeless dwarf galaxy](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.00145)
  * **Interesting**
  * Light echoes from photoionized clouds around accreting black holes, in combination with the velocity of these clouds, yield a direct mass measurement
  * Here we report an exceptionally low reverberation delay of 83±14 minutes between variability in the accretion disk and high velocity Hα emission from the nucleus of the bulgeless dwarf galaxy NGC~4395
  * This lag determines a mass of about 10,000~M⊙ for the black hole
  * This mass is among the smallest central black hole masses reported, near the low end of expected masses for heavy "seeds", and the best direct mass measurement for a galaxy of this size.
  * 但是依然符合M_BH-sigma*关系

* [Starburst and post-starburst high-redshift protogalaxies: The feedback impact of high energy cosmic rays](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.00338)
  * 讨论宇宙线如何影响恒星形成和Quenching：These high energy particles interact with the baryon and radiation fields of their host via hadronic processes to produce secondary leptons. The secondary particles then also interact with ambient radiation fields to generate X-rays through inverse-Compton scattering. 
  * At high-redshift, a substantial amount of CR secondary electron energy can be diverted into inverse-Compton X-ray emission. This yields an X-ray luminosity of above 1041 erg s−1 by redshift z=7 which drives a further heating effect, operating over larger scales. 可以停止cold inflow

* [The redshift evolution of X-ray and Sunyaev-Zel'dovich scaling relations in the FABLE simulations](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.00013)
  * **Relevant**
  * 27个高分辨的zoom-in cluster模拟：We predict significant deviations of all examined scaling relations from the simple self-similar expectations.
  * 需要考虑标度关系的红移演化：While the slopes are approximately independent of redshift, the normalisations evolve positively with respect to self-similarity, even for commonly-used mass proxies such as the YX parameter.
  * 导致红移演化的因素：more effective AGN feedback in lower mass haloes, larger binding energy of gas at a given halo mass at higher redshifts and larger non-thermal pressure support from kinetic motions at higher redshifts.
  * We find that the intrinsic scatter of the relations, which agrees well with most observational constraints, increases at lower redshifts and for lower mass systems.

* [Probability of magnification in the Hubble Frontier Fields clusters](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.00017)
  * Free-form gravitational lensing models derived with the WSLAP+ code for the six Hubble Frontier Fields clusters 
  * We confirm MACS 0717 as the cluster with the most complex structure, and having the largest lensing efficiency and Einstein radius.

* [Free-form lens model and mass estimation of the high redshift galaxy cluster ACT-CL J0102-4915, "El Gordo"](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.00017)
  * 质量最大的高红移星系团 (z=0.9)，接近了宇宙学模型允许的极限：We use data from the RELICS program and identify new multiply lensed system candidates.
  * By fitting a projected NFW mass distribution to the strong-lensing regime, we infer a total mass for the cluster of M200c=(1.35±0.15)×10^15M⊙
  * We also find in our lens map a mass overdensity corresponding to the large cometary tail of hot gas, reinforcing its interpretation as a large tidal feature predicted by our hydrodynamical simulations
  * El Gordo is one of the first clusters that will be observed with JWST, which is expected to unveil new high redshift lensed galaxies around this interesting cluster, thus allowing us to improve on its mass estimation.

* [GAMA+KiDS: Alignment of galaxies in galaxy groups and its dependence on galaxy scale](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.00370)
  * We measure the alignment of shapes of satellite galaxies, in galaxy groups, with respect to the brightest group galaxy (BGG), as well as alignments of the BGG shape with the satellite positions, using the highly complete Galaxy And Mass Assembly (GAMA) spectroscopic survey and deep imaging from the Kilo Degree Survey.
  * We find a significant satellite radial alignment signal, which vanishes at large separations from the BGG.
  * We do not identify any strong trends of the signal with galaxy absolute magnitude or group mass. The alignment signal is dominated by red satellites.
  * We also find that the outer regions of galaxies are aligned more strongly than their inner regions, by varying the radial weight employed during the shape measurement process.
