#### [Precision Pollution - The effects of enrichment yields and timing on galactic chemical evolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.00007)
    * Attribution of the galaxy-scale abundance patterns to individual enrichment mechanisms such as the winds from asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars or the presence of a prompt fraction of Type Ia supernovae is complicated by the interaction between them and gas cooling, subsequent star formation and gas ejection.
    * Delay time distribution: DTD; We find DTDs with a large prompt fraction (such as the bimodal and power-law models) have, at z = 0, similar abundance patterns compared to the low-prompt component time distributions (uniform or wide Gaussian models).
    * 但是两个情形的 [X/Fe] ratio和铁丰度演化不同


#### [Uncorrelated velocity and size residuals across galaxy rotation curves](https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.00271)
    - **Relevant, Interesting**
    * We study the coupling of the Tully–Fisher and mass–size relations both in observations (the SPARC sample) and in empirical galaxy formation models based on halo abundance matching.
    * 看TF关系和mass-size relation的residuls之间在不同半径上的相关:We find no significant correlation in either the data or models for any r.
    * We do however find evidence for an anticorrelation of galaxy size with halo concentration at fixed baryonic mass


#### [Analyzing interferometric observations of strong gravitational lenses with recurrent and convolutional neural networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.00011)
    - **Useful, Interesting**
    * training a feed-forward CNN on dirty images, and find that neural networks can simultaneously adapt to dirty images generated from vastly different uv-coverages.
    * we use the recurrent inference machine (RIM) introduced in Putzky & Welling (2017). This provides a fast and automated alternative to the traditional CLEAN algorithm.

#### [Stellar Radiation is Critical for Regulating Star Formation and Driving Outflows in Low Mass Dwarf Galaxies](https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.00468)
    * However, it has been recently suggested that pre-SN feedback, from either stellar winds or stellar radiation, is necessary in high-resolution simulations of galaxy evolution to properly regulate star formation and properties of the interstellar medium (ISM).
    * 一般模拟只是说让新生恒星周围的dense分子云被摧毁
    * we use high resolution simulations (1.8 pc) of an isolated dwarf galaxy with detailed stellar feedback tracked on a star-by-star basis.
    * We find that including ionizing radiation reduces the star formation rate by over a factor of 5, and is necessary in creating the ISM conditions needed for supernovae to drive significant outflows.


#### [A Galaxy-Scale Fountain of Cold Molecular Gas Pumped by a Black Hole](https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.00473)
    - **Interesting, Relevant**
    * A2597中间超大质量分子云filament的ALMA+MUSE观测
    * Its warm ionized and cold molecular components are both cospatial and comoving, consistent with the hypothesis that the optical nebula traces the warm envelopes of many cold molecular clouds
    * The clouds are not in dynamical equilibrium, and instead show evidence for inflow toward the central supermassive black hole, outflow along the jets it launches, and uplift by the buoyant hot bubbles those jets inflate.
    * a galaxy-spanning “fountain”, wherein cold gas clouds drain into the black hole accretion reservoir, powering jets and bubbles that uplift a cooling plume of low-entropy multiphase gas, which may stimulate additional cooling and accretion as part of a self-regulating feedback loop


#### [The Massively Accreting Cluster A2029](https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.00488)
    - **Relevant**
    * The complete redshift survey of A2029 also identifies at least 12 foreground and background systems (10 are extended X-ray sources)
    * 附近有A2033和Southern Infalling Group两个主要substructure，质量都不小
    * Simple dynamical considerations suggest that A2029 will accrete these subsystems in next few Gyr.


#### [OMEGA - OSIRIS Mapping of Emission-line Galaxies in A901/2: IV. - Extinction of Star-Formation Estimators with Inclination](https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.00530)
    * study the effect of inclination on the apparent brightness of star-forming galaxies in spectral passbands that are commonly used as star-formation indicators
    * 使用了tunable-filter imaging
    * we find trends in the UV and Hα mass-to-light ratio that suggest an inclination-induced attenuation from face-on to edge-on of ∼ 1 mag and ∼ 0.7 mag in UV and Hα, respectively, implying that star-formation rates of edge-on galaxies would be underestimated by ∼ 2.5× in UV and ∼ 2× in Hα.

#### [Galaxy Structure in the Ultraviolet: The Dependence of Morphological Parameters on Rest-Frame Wavelength](https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.00577)
    * We find a relationship between the CAS parameters and observed rest-frame wavelength that make galaxies appear more late-type at shorter wavelengths, particularly in the UV
    * The effect is strongest for E/S0 galaxies in the far-UV, which have concentrations and asymmetries that more resemble those of spiral and peculiar/merging galaxies in the optical.

#### [Supermassive black holes with high accretion rates in active galactic nuclei. VII. Reconstruction of velocity-delay maps by maximum entropy method](https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.00705)
    * we apply the maximum entropy method (MEM) to 9 narrow-line Seyfert 1 galaxies with super-Eddington accretion rates observed during 2012-2013 for the velocity-delay maps of their Hβ and Hγ emission lines.
    * These super-Eddington accretors show diverse geometry and kinematics.

## August 5:

#### [The QUEST-La Silla AGN variability survey: connection between AGN variability and black hole physical properties](https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.00967)
    * We found that the amplitude of the variability (A) depends solely on the rest frame emission wavelength and the Eddington ratio, where A anti-correlates with both λrest and L/LEdd.
        - Its amplitude is inversely related to the accretion rate.
    * For 20.6% of the variable sources in our sample, a DRW model is not appropriate to describe the variability


#### [Stellar Feedback and the Energy Budget of Late-Type Galaxies: Missing Baryons and Core Creation](https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.00971)
    * By fitting halo profiles to the rotation curves of galaxies in the SPARC data set, we measure the “missing baryon” mass for individual late-type systems.
    * we show that the maximum energy available from supernovae is typically not enough to completely eject these “missing baryons” from a halo, but it is often sufficient to heat them to the virial temperature.
    * the energy available from supernova feedback is always enough to convert a primordial cusp into a core and has magnitude consistent with what is required to heat the “missing baryons” to the virial temperature.

#### [Witnessing galaxy assembly at the edge of the reionization epoch](https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.01146)
    * Serenity-18, a galaxy at z ≃ 5.939 for which we could measure the content of molecular gas; 还有 gas clump/filament which is possibly feeding its growth
    * The metal poor gas is detected through a damped Lyman-α absorber observed at a spatial separation of 40 kpc and at the same redshift


#### [Low-luminosity AGN and X-ray binary populations in COSMOS star-forming galaxies](https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.00970)
    * X-ray stacking analysis of ∼75,000 star-forming galaxies between 0.1 < z < 5.0 using the Chandra COSMOS Legacy survey to study the X-ray emission of low-luminosity active galactic nuclei (AGN)
    * Comparing the measured luminosities to established XRB scaling relations, we find that the redshift evolution of the luminosity per star formation rate (SFR) of XRBs depends sensitively on the assumed obscuration
    * After subtracting the estimated XRB contribution from the stacks, we find that most stacks at z > 1.3 exhibit a significant X-ray excess indicating nuclear emission. The AGN emission is strongly correlated with stellar mass but does not exhibit an additional correlation with SFR.
    * The hardness ratios of the high-redshift stacks indicate that the AGN are substantially obscured

## August 6:

#### [Black Hole - Galaxy Scaling Relationships for Active Galactic Nuclei with Reverberation Masses](https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.01329)
    - **Important**
    * We have separated the host galaxy from the bright central AGN, allowing a re-examination of the MBH − Lbulge and MBH − Lgalaxy relationships and the MBH − Mbulge and MBH − Mstars relationships using V-H color to constrain the stellar mass-to-light ratio.
    * We also find good agreement with the expectations from the Illustris simulations, although the agreement with other simulations is less clear because of the different black hole mass ranges that are probed.
    * MBH − Lbulge is found to have the least scatter, and is therefore the best predictor of MBH among the relationships examined here.
    * We have examined MBH/Mstars and find a clear trend with black hole mass but not galaxy mass.


#### [On the influence of environment on star forming galaxies](https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.01628)
    * GAEA SAM研究
    * We analyse the origin of differences between physical properties of satellites and those of their central counterparts, identified by matching the Vmax of their host haloes at the accretion time of the satellites.
    * In contrast, our model predicts larger differences with respect to data for the molecular gas mass and star formation rate.
        - that differences in the gas content arise after accretion, and can be entirely ascribed to the instantaneous strip- ping of the hot gas reservoir.
    * We argue that these disagreements could be largely resolved with the inclusion of a proper treatment for ram-pressure stripping of cold gas and a more gradual stripping of the hot gas reservoir.


#### [ALMA 12CO (J=1--0) imaging of the nearby galaxy M83: Variations in the efficiency of star formation in giant molecular clouds](https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.01702)
    * In the eastern arm, the CO peaks form two arc-shaped ridges that run along the arm and exhibit a distinct difference in the activity of star formation: the one on the leading side has numerous H II regions associated with it, whereas the other one on the trailing side has only a few.


#### [An early-type galaxy with an inner star-forming disk](https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.01730)
    * We report a discovery of an ETG (SDSS J142055.01+400715.7) with M∗=10^10 M⊙ that offers direct evidence for gas-rich merging as the origin of low-mass ETGs.
    * Furthermore, the inner disk harbors on-going star formation, indicating the merging to be gas rich.


#### [GAMA/G10-COSMOS/3D-HST: Evolution of the galaxy stellar mass function over 12.5Gyrs](https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.01754)
    - **Relevant, Important**
    * Surprisingly, when fitting a two-component Schechter function, we find essentially no evidence of temporal evolution in M⋆, the two α slope parameters, or the normalisation of the low-mass component.
    * Instead, our fits suggest that the various shape parameters have been exceptionally stable over cosmic time, as has the normalisation of the low- mass component, and that the evolution of the stellar-mass function is well described by a simple build up of the high-mass component over time.
    * Finally, we find that the evolution of the stellar-mass function, and the observed stellar mass density, can be well described by a simple model of constant growth in the high-mass source density


#### [Revealing Dusty Supernovae in High-Redshift (Ultra-)Luminous InfraRed Galaxies Through Near-Infrared Integrated Light Variability](https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.01780)
    * 在高红移ULIRGS里找SN: to search for the presence of supernovae through the variability of the integrated restframe infrared light of the entire hosts.
    * We obtain a sample of (U)LIRGs that have secure optical counterparts, and examine their light curves in 3–5 μm in the IRAC Dark Field (IDF), 有14年的数据
    * We present two cases where the distinct features in their light curves are consistent with multiple supernovae overlapping in time.


#### [CANDELSz7: a large spectroscopic survey of CANDELS galaxies in the reionization epoch](https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.01847)
    * results of CANDELSz7, an ESO large program aimed at confirming spectroscopically a homogeneous sample of z≃6 and z≃7 star forming galaxies.
    * FORS2 12-20小时的光谱
    * For about 40% of the galaxies we could determine a spectroscopic redshift, mainly through the detection of a single emission line that we interpret as Lyα emission
    * we assemble a sample of ≃ 260 galaxies that we use to explore the evolution of the Lyα fraction in Lyman break galaxies and the change in the shape of the emission line between z ∼ 6 and z ∼ 7.


#### [Extreme jet bending on kiloparsec scales : the 'doughnut' in NGC 6109](https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.01967)
    * We find the radio morphology of the counter-jet to be highly distorted, showing a unique ‘doughnut’ structure ∼6 kpc in diameter.
    * The doughnut is overpressured compared with the surrounding atmosphere as measured with Chandra.
    * A light jet being deflected by gas flows and winds just outside the transition between the galaxy and cluster atmospheres appears to be a more plausible interpretation.


#### [Steep Hard-X-ray Spectra Indicate Extremely High Accretion Rates in Weak Emission-Line Quasars](https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.01306)
    * WLQs have steeper X-ray spectra, suggesting higher accretion rates with respect to “typical” quasars.
    * Collectively, the four radio-intermediate WLQs have lower photon indices with respect to the six radio-quiet WLQs, as may be expected if the spectra of the first group are contaminated by X-ray emission from a jet.
    * We detect soft excess emission in our lowest-redshift radio-quiet WLQ, in agreement with previous findings suggesting that the prominence of this feature is associated with a high accretion rate.

## August 7:

#### [Mid-Infrared Spectroscopic Evidence for AGN Heating Warm Molecular Gas](https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.02035)
    * We use four MIR diagnostics to estimate the contribution of the AGN to the total MIR emission.
    * We compare the relative strengths of PAH emission features and find that PAH grains in AGN-dominated sources have a wider range of sizes and fractional ionizations than PAH grains in non-AGN dominated sources.
    * We find an average 200 K difference between the excitation temperatures of the H2S(5) and H2S(7) pure rotational molecular hydrogen transition pair in AGN-dominated versus non-AGN dominated galaxies.


#### [A GBT Survey of the HALOGAS Galaxies and Their Environments I: Revealing the full extent of HI around NGC891, NGC925, NGC4414 & NGC4565](https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.02041)
    * The Hi mass fraction below Hi column densities of 10^19 cm−2 is, on average, 2%.
    * The absence of a considerable amount of newly detected Hi by the GBT indicates these galaxies do not have significant extended diffuse Hi structures


#### [Shocks or Photoionization: Direct Temperature Measurements of the Low-Ionization Gas in Quiescent Galaxies](https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.02041)
    - **Interesting**
    * Stacking SDSS光谱，用直接温度法看quiescent red sequence星系中的低电离气体的电离机制
    * temperature-sensitive [O iii] λ4363, [N ii] λ5755, [Sii]λλ4068,4076,and[Oii]λλ7320,7330 lines
    * The [Sii] doublet ratios indicate the line-emitting gas is in the low density regime
    * We found that the extinction corrections derived from Balmer decrements would yield unphysical re- lationships between the temperatures of the S+ zones and O+ zones, indicating that the extinction is significantly overestimated by the measured Balmer decrements
    * We compared these line ratios with model predictions for three ionization mechanisms: photoionization by hot evolved stars, shocks, and turbulent mixing layers. --> 但是三个都不行


#### [The z=0.54 LoBAL Quasar SDSS J085053.12+445122.5: I. Spectral Synthesis Analysis Reveals a Massive Outflow](https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.02441)
    * We introduce SimBAL, a novel spectral-synthesis procedure that uses large grids of ionic column densities generated by the photoionization code Cloudy and a Bayesian model calibration to forward-model broad absorption line quasar spectra.
    * The outflow lies 1–3 parsecs from the central engine, consistent with the estimated location of the torus.

    * Deep 1–4 GHz VLA observations of CIZA J2242.8+5301 (z = 0.1921), a double radio relic cluster characterized by small projection on the plane of the sky.
    * We discover new faint diffuse radio emission extending north of the main northern relic.
    * High-resolution mapping of other tailed radio galaxies also supports a scenario where AGN fossil electrons are revived by the merger event and could be related to the formation of some diffuse cluster radio emission.


#### [Correlations between the Dark Matter and Baryonic Properties of CLASH Galaxy Clusters](https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.02136)
    - **Relevant**
    * The total density profiles derived from lensing are interpreted based on the two-phase scenario of cluster formation. In this context, the brightest cluster galaxy (BCG) forms in the first dissipative phase, followed by a dissipationless phase where baryonic physics flattens the inner DM distribution.
    * The inner slope of the DM density for the CLASH clusters is found to be flatter than the Navarro–Frenk–White profile, ranging from α = 0.30 to 0.79. --> 受重子物质过程的影响
    * We examine correlations of the DM density slope α with the effective radius Re and stellar mass Me of the BCG, finding that these quantities are anti-correlated
    * We also study the correlation between Re and the cluster halo mass M500, and the correlation between the total masses inside 5kpc and 100 kpc. We find that these quantities are correlated with Spearman coefficients of 0.68 and 0.64

## August 8:

#### [Connecting Young Star Clusters to CO Molecular Gas in NGC 7793 with ALMA-LEGUS](https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.02496)
    * We find a strong spatial correlation between young star clusters and GMCs such that all clusters still associated with a GMC are younger than 11 Myr and display a median age of 2 Myr.
    * The age distribution increases gradually as the cluster–GMC distance increases, with star clusters that are spatially unassociated with molecular gas exhibiting a median age of 7 Myr.
    * Star clusters are significantly more clustered than the molecular cloud hierarchy


#### [Angular Momentum and Galaxy Formation Revisited: Scaling Relations for Disks and Bulges](https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.02525)
    - **Interesting**
    * We show that the stellar specific angular momentum j⋆, mass M⋆, and bulge fraction β⋆ of normal galaxies of all morphological types are consistent with a simple model based on a linear superposition of independent disks and bulges.
    * This model correctly predicts that galaxies follow a curved 2D surface in the 3D space of logj⋆, logM⋆, and β⋆


#### [Investigation of the orientation of galaxies in clusters: the importance, methods and results of research](https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.02573)
    - **Relevant**
    * Now, the method allowed analysis both position angles of galaxy major axes and two angles describing the spatial orientation of galaxies
    * We have found that the orientations of galaxies in analyzed clusters are not random. It means that we genuinely confirmed an existence of the alignment of galaxies in rich Abells’ galaxy clusters.


#### [A Deep Lyα Survey in ECDF-S and COSMOS: I. General Properties of Lyman-alpha Emitters at z∼2](https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.02704)
    * The narrowband surveys conducted at Magellan II telescope allow us to obtain a sample of 452 LAEs reaching a 5σ limiting magnitude of ∼ 26 mag
    * There are six LAEs detected by the Spitzer/MIPS 24μm or even Herschel far-infrared observations.
    * LAE覆盖的质量和SFR范围都很大
    * they are mostly low-mass star-forming galaxies and follow the star formation main sequence relations or their extrapolations to the low-mass end, implying a normal star-forming nature of LAEs.


#### [A star-forming dwarf galaxy candidate in the halo of NGC 4634](https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.02801)
    * We investigate the nature and origin of a star-forming dwarf galaxy candidate located in the halo of the edge-on Virgo galaxy NGC 4634 with a projected distance of 1.4 kpc
    * The high oxygen abundance (12 + log(O/H) ≈ 8.72) of the dwarf galaxy candidate leads to the conclusion that it was formed from pre-enriched material.


#### [The `Cosmic Seagull': a highly magnified disk-like galaxy at z~2.8 behind the Bullet Cluster](https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.02828)
    * Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array measurements of the ‘Cosmic Seagull’, a strongly magnified galaxy at 𝑧 = 2.7779 behind the Bullet Cluster.

    * 超级好的HI数据：The data reveal many small-scale anomalous velocity features highlighting the complexity of the interacting M81 triplet.
    * This comparison provides evidence for the presence of a substantial reservoir of low-column density gas in the northern part of the triplet, probably associated with M82. Such a reservoir is not found in the southern part.
    * We report a number of newly discovered kpc-sized low-mass H i clouds with H i masses of a few times 10^6 M⊙. 都和Tidal feature有关


#### [Bayesian photometric redshifts of blended sources](https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.02846)
    - **Relevant**
    * We present a Bayesian photometric redshift method for blended sources with an arbitrary number of intrinsic components.
    * Using Bayesian model comparison, we infer the probability that a source is blended and the number of components that it contains. We make available blendz, a Python implementation of our method.


#### [AGN feedback in the Phoenix cluster](https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.02872)
    * XMM/RGS观测，研究发射X-ray的“冷”气体：We detect for the first time evidence of O VIII and FeXXI-XXII emission lines, the latter demonstrating the presence of gas below 2 keV.
    * Cooling rate below 2 keV是350 Msun/yr；和SFR近似
    * This cooling rate is high enough to produce the molecular gas found in the filaments via instabilities during the buoyant rising time.
    * The line broadening indicates that the turbulence (∼ 300 km s−1 or less) is below the level required to produce and propagate the heat throughout the cool core.

## August 9:

#### [Standoff Distance of Bow Shocks in Galaxy Clusters as Proxy for Mach Number](https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.02885)
    * One of the pure geometrical proxies to the shock Mach number is the standoff distance, i.e. the distance between the leading edge of the shock and the contact discontinuity. 即便仪器分辨率不够，也可以用来估计subcluster并合的速度
    * a combination of the standoff distance with measurements of the Mach number from density/temperature jumps can differentiate between the pre- and post-merger stages, at least when the merger axis is close to the plane of sky or if the merger axis angle to the line of sight can be inferred.


#### [Nitrogen-to-Oxygen Abundance Ratio Variation In Quiescent Galaxies](https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.02891)
    - **Important**
    * We establish a gas phase abundance pattern calibration for quiescent galaxies using optical emission lines.
    * We show that the relative trend in N/O abun- dance can still be reliably measured based on [N ii] λλ6548,6583/[O ii] λλ3726,3729 and a direct measurement of the electron temperature.
    * Combining [O ii] λλ3726,3729/[O ii] λ7320,7330 and [S ii] λλ6716,6731/[S ii] λ4068,4076
    * We establish the calibration for N/O based on [N ii]/[O ii] and a temperature tracer.


#### [The Evolution of Assembly Bias](https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.02896)
    - **Relevant**
    * Dark matter only simulation: We investigate how the clustering of haloes and their galaxy content depend on halo formation time and concentration, and how these relationships evolve with redshift.
    * we look at the evolution of assembly bias reflected in the galaxy distribution by examining the galaxy correlation functions relative to those of shuffled galaxy samples which remove the occupancy variation. This correlation functions ratio monotonically decreases with larger redshift and for lower number density samples, going below unity in some cases, leading to reduced galaxy clustering.


#### [Intense CIII 1907,1909 emission from a strong Lyman continuum emitting galaxy](https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.03059)
    * first complete ultraviolet (UV) spectrum of a strong Lyman continuum(LyC) emitter at low redshift – the

    * The Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph spectrum shows strong Lyα and C iii] λ1909 emission, as well as O iii] λ1666
    * Combining our measurements and earlier determinations from the literature, we find a trend of increasing ξ0 ion
with increasing C iii] λ1909 equivalent width, which can be understood by a combination of decreasing stellar population age and metallicity.

    * The mid-IR excess and control samples differ strongly in [OIII] line luminosity, ionized gas excitation mechanism, ionization state and electron density.
    * radio-detected, mid-IR excess AGN constitute the most luminous and highly ionized AGN in the local Universe and they contribute primarily to the growth of black holes in the most massive galaxies.

#### [Probing star formation in galaxies at z≈1 via a Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope stacking analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.03279)
    * Deep 610 MHz continuum imaging of four sub-fields of the DEEP2 Galaxy Redshift Survey.
    * Stacked a large sample for 1.4GHz signal
    * The stacked emission is unresolved, with a rest-frame 1.4 GHz luminosity of L1.4 GHz = (4.13 ± 0.24) × 1022 W Hz−1


#### [A Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope survey for associated HI 21-cm absorption in the Caltech-Jodrell Flat-spectrum sample](https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.03280)
    * Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (GMRT) survey for associated Hi 21-cm absorption from 50 active galactic nuclei (AGNs), at z ≈ 0.04 − 3.01
    * Clean spectra were obtained towards 40 sources, yielding two new absorption detections, at z = 0.229 towards TXS 0003+380 and z = 0.333 towards TXS 1456+375



#### [HST F160W Imaging of Very Massive Galaxies at 1.5<z<3.0: Diversity of Structures and the Effect of Close Pairs on Number Density Estimates](https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.03284)
    - **Relevant, Important**
    * a targeted follow-up Hubble Space Telescope WFC3 F160W imaging study of very massive galaxies (log(Mstar/M⊙) > 11.2) selected from a combination of ground-based near-infrared galaxy surveys (UltraVISTA, NMBS-II, UKIDSS UDS) at 1.5 < z < 3.
    * We find that these galaxies are diverse in their structures, with ∼ 1/3 of the targets being composed of close pairs, and span a wide range in sizes.
    * We used the observed light profiles of the blended systems to decompose their stellar masses and investigate the effect of the close pairs on the measured number densities of very massive galaxies in the early universe.
    * Although we currently lack the statistics to robustly correct for close-pair blends, we show that this is a systematic effect which can reduce the observed number density of very massive galaxies by up to a factor of ∼ 1.5, and should be accounted for in future studies of stellar mass functions.


#### [CLUES about M33: the reversed radial stellar age gradient in the outskirts of Triangulum galaxy](https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.03286)
    * ACS观测发现恒星年龄随半径增加；但是到最外侧 a reversal of this gradient is detected
    * We investigate the origin of such a reversal in stellar age gradient, by using a simulated M33 analogue from the Constrained Local UniversE Simulations (CLUES).
    * We demonstrate that this reversal is mostly a result of stellar accretion from old satellite galaxies and, to a lesser extent, of stellar migration of in-situ stars.


#### [Extragalactic Imprints in Galactic Dust Maps](https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.03294)
    - **Interesting**
    * We investigate whether these maps are contaminated by extragalactic signals using the so-called clustering redshift tech- nique, i.e. by measuring a set of angular cross-correlations with spectroscopic galaxies and quasars as a function of redshift. 大多数尘埃map都有河外星系的印记
    * When such maps are used for extinction corrections, this extragalactic contamination introduces redshift- and scale-dependent biases in photometric estimates at the milli-magnitude level.
    * As expected, we do not detect any extragalactic contamination for the dust map inferred from the distribution of HI from 21cm observations
    * We note that using the WISE 12 micron map sensitive to Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAH), an indirect dust tracer, we detect the diffuse extragalactic PAH background up to z ∼ 2.


#### [The SAMI Galaxy Survey: Data Release Two with absorption-line physics value-added products](https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.03365)
    - **Useful, Important**
    * Data Release Two includes data for 1559 galaxies, about 50% of the full survey.
    * This includes all emission line value-added products from Data Release One, expanded to the larger sample. In addition we include stellar kinematic and stellar population value-added products derived from absorption line measurements.
    * Stellar velocity dispersion profile: suggests a transition mass around log(M⋆/M⊙) ∼ 10 for galaxies with or without a dispersion–dominated bulge.


#### [The Missing Satellite Problem Outside of the Local Group: I -- Pilot Observation](https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.03410)
    - **Relevant**
    * A pilot observation of nearby (∼ 20 Mpc) galaxies with mass similar to that of the Milky Way (MW) to address the missing satellite problem.
    * By applying a surface brightness cut together with a careful visual screening to remove artifacts and background contamination, we construct a sample of dwarf galaxies. The luminosity function (LF) of one of the targets is broadly consistent with that of the MW, but the other has a more abundant dwarf population.
    * We also characterize the projected spatial distributions of the satellites and do not observe strong evidence for alignments around the central galaxies.


#### [A census of ionized gas outflows in type 1 AGNs: gas outflows in AGNs. V](https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.03415)
    * For the majority of Type 1 AGNs (i.e., ∼ 89%), the [O III] line profile is best represented by a double Gaussian model, presenting the kinematic signature of the non-virial motion.
    * The fraction of AGNs with outflow signatures is found to increase steeply with [O III] luminosity and Eddington ratio, while Type 1 AGNs have larger velocity dispersion and more negative velocity shift than Type 2 AGNs.


#### [Dark-ages Reionization and Galaxy Formation Simulation - XV. Stellar evolution and feedback in dwarf galaxies at high redshift](https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.03455)
    - **Yuxiang Qin**
    * Directly compare predictions of dwarf galaxy properties in a semi-analytic model (SAM) with those extracted from a high-resolution hydrodynamic simulation.
    * The SAM can reproduce the cosmic evolution of galaxy properties predicted by the hydrodynamic simulation.
    * We further find that dwarf galaxies rapidly build up their star-forming reservoirs in the early universe (z > 10), with the relevant time-scale becoming significantly longer towards lower redshifts.


#### [Quantifying the power spectrum of small-scale structure in semi-analytic galaxies](https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.03501)
    * Recent work has suggested that the full population of subhalos could be probed using a power spectrum analysis
    * We find that a measurement of the slope and amplitude of the power spectrum on galaxy strong lensing scales (k ∼ 1 kpc−1) could be used to distinguish between CDM and alternate dark matter models, especially if the most massive subhalos can be directly detected via gravitational imaging.


#### [Simultaneous H alpha and dust reverberation mapping of 3C120: Testing the bowl-shaped torus geometry](https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.03572)
    *  Compared to earlier epochs 3C 120 is about a factor of three brighter, allowing us to study the shape of the broad line region (BLR) and the dust torus in a high luminosity phase.
    * The analysis of the light curves yields that the dust echo is rather sharp and symmetric in contrast to the more complex broad Hα BLR echo.

#### [How low does it go? Too few Galactic satellites with standard reionization quenching](https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.03654)
    * We use a suite of cosmological zoom simulations of Milky Way-like haloes that include central Milky Way disk galaxy potentials to investigate the relationship between subhaloes and ultrafaint galaxies.
    * We find that there are far too few subhaloes within 50 kpc of the Milky Way that had Vpeak ~ 20 km s−1 to account for the number of ultrafaint galaxies already known within that volume today.
    * In order to match the observed count, we must populate subhaloes down to Vpeak ≃ 6kms−1 with ultrafaint dwarfs.

    * We select 120 cluster member galaxies and compute the cluster redshift ⟨z⟩ ∼ 0.296 and the global line-of-sight velocity dispersion σV ∼ 1100 km s−1
    * While this picture is in agreement with previous results based on X-ray data and on the existence of the central cool core, we do not find any evidence of a merging process responsible for the radio halo discovered in this cluster.


#### [Nuclear vs. Integrated Spectroscopy of Galaxies in the Herschel Reference Survey](https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.04279)
    * Here we aim to provide a spectroscopic characterization of the nuclei of galaxies belonging to the Herschel Reference Survey (HRS)
    * Using two diagnostic diagrams (the BPT and the WHAN) we provide a nuclear and an integrated spectral classification for the HRS galaxies. The BPT and the WHAN methods for nuclei consistently give a frequency of 53-64% HII, around 21-27% AGNs (including TRAN), and 15-20% of PAS (including RET), whereas for integrated spectra they give 69-84% HII, 4-11% of AGNs and 12-20% PAS.

    * This paper presents the largest catalogue of VLBI detected sources in GOODS-N comprising of 31 compact radio sources across a redshift range of 0.11-3.44, almost three times more than previous VLBI surveys in this field.

    * far-ultraviolet spectra and ancillary data of the super star cluster SSC-N and its surrounding H II region in the nearby dwarf galaxy II Zw 40.
    * SSC-N and its nebulosity are an order of magnitude more massive and luminous than 30 Doradus and its ionizing cluster.
    * The SSC-N nebula does not coincide with the locus defined by local galaxies. Rather, it coincides with the location of “Green Pea” galaxies, objects which are often considered nearby analogs of the galaxies reionizing the universe.
    * the SSC-N cluster has strong, broad, stellar He II 1640 emission that cannot be reproduced, suggesting a deficit of He-enhanced stars with massive winds in the models.

#### [Cosmological simulations of the circumgalactic medium with 1 kpc resolution: enhanced HI column densities](https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.04369)
    * We get around this issue by running zoom-in simulations of a Milky Way-mass galaxy with standard mass refinement and additional uniform spatial refinement within the virial radius. This results in a detailed view of its gaseous halo at unprecedented (1 kpc) uniform resolution with only a moderate increase in computational time.
    * It drastically changes the radial profile of the neutral hydrogen column density, which is enhanced at galactocentric radii larger than 40 kpc
    * The covering fraction of Lyman-Limit Systems within 150 kpc is almost doubled.


#### [COLDz: Shape of the CO Luminosity Function at High Redshift and the Cold Gas History of the Universe](https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.04371)
    * We report the first detailed measurement of the shape of the CO luminosity function at high redshift, based on >320 hr of Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA)
    * We find that the characteristic luminosity and bright end of the CO luminosity function are substantially higher than predicted by semi-analytical models, but consistent with empirical estimates based on the infrared luminosity function at z∼2.
    * Our results thus appear to suggest that the cosmic star-formation rate density follows an increased cold molecular gas content in galaxies towards its peak about 10 billion years ago, and that its decline towards the earliest epochs is likely related to a lower overall amount of cold molecular gas


#### [The CO Luminosity Density at High-z (COLDz) Survey: A Sensitive, Large Area Blind Search for Low-J CO Emission from Cold Gas in the Early Universe with the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array](https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.04372)
    * The first spectral line deep field targeting CO(1–0) emission from galaxies at z = 1.95 − 2.85 and CO(2–1) at z = 4.91 − 6.70
    * Our blind search for CO(1–0) uniformly selects starbursts and massive Main Sequence galaxies based on their cold molecular gas masses. Our search also detects CO(2–1) line emission from optically dark, dusty star-forming galaxies at z > 5.
    * Through CO line stacking, we constrain the gas mass fraction in previously known typical star-forming galaxies at z = 2–3. The stacked CO detection suggests lower molecular gas mass fractions than expected for massive Main Sequence galaxies by a factor of ∼ 3 − 6.

    - **Important, Relevant**
    * COSMOS-DASH is the widest HST/WFC3 imaging survey in H160 filter, tripling the extragalactic survey area in the near-infrared at HST resolution.
    * We find no statistical difference between the median sizes of the most massive star-forming and quiescent galaxies at ⟨z⟩ = 2.5
    * However, we do find a significant difference in the Sersic index between the two samples, such that massive quiescent galaxies have higher central densities than star forming galaxies.


#### [A SALT Spectral Study of S0s Hosting Pseudobulges](https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.04491)
    * The central spectra of galaxies without bars in our sample reveal a complex star formation history, which is consistent with the belief that pseudobulges have a history of star formation distributed over extended periods of time.


#### [Alma Twenty-six Arcmin^2 Survey Of Goods-s At One-millimeter (asagao): Source Catalog And Number Counts](https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.04502)
    * Array (ALMA) twenty-six arcmin2 survey of GOODS-S at one-millimeter (ASAGAO).
    * We create infrared (IR) luminosity functions (LFs) in the redshift range of z = 1–3 from the ASAGAO sources with KS -band counterparts, and constrain the faintest luminosity of the LF at 2.0 < z < 3.0. The LFs are con- sistent with previous results based on other ALMA and SCUBA-2 observations, which suggest a positive luminosity evolution and negative density evolution with increasing redshift.


#### [Internal Kinematics of UM 461 and CTS 1020](https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.04508)
    * We found that the motion in both star-forming knots of UM 461 has different patterns, suggesting a weak kinematical connection between the knots.
    * We found that UM 461 seems to be more susceptible to stellar feedback, whereas in CTS 1020 the gravitational potential dominates.


#### [AKARI mid-infrared slitless spectroscopic survey of star-forming galaxies at z≲0.5](https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.04566)
    * We conducted a low-resolution (R ≃ 50) slitless spectroscopic survey at 5–13 μm of 9 μm flux- selected sources (> 0.3 mJy) around the North Ecliptic Pole with the Infrared Camera (IRC) onboard AKARI.
    * The rest-frame SEDs of all PAH galaxies have a universal shape with stellar and 7.7 μm bumps, except that the PAH enhancement significantly varies as a function of the PAH luminosities.
    * We identified a PAH-enhanced population at z   0.35, whose SEDs and luminosities are typical of luminous infrared galaxies. They show particularly larger PAH enhancement at high luminosity,


#### [Ubiquitous ram pressure stripping in the Coma cluster of galaxies](https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.04575)

    * 在Coma里找到了三个RPS的例子，之前Russell Smith发现过：We therefore devoted one full night of Hα observation to each of the three galaxies using the San Pedro Martir 2.1m telescope. One-sided tails of Hα emission of 10-20 kpc projected size were detected, suggesting an ongoing ram pressure stripping event.
    * This brings the number sources with Hα trails to 17 gaseous tails out of 27 (63 %) late-type galaxies (LTG) galaxies members of the Coma cluster with direct evidence of ram pressure stripping.


#### [The XXL Survey: XXXIII. Chandra Constraints on the AGN Contamination of z > 1 XXL Galaxy Clusters](https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.04623)
    * With the superior angular resolution of Chandra we investigate whether there are any point sources within the cluster region that were not detected by the XMM-XXL analysis pipeline, and whether any point sources were misclassified as distant clusters.
    * Of the 14 clusters: Of the other five sources, one is significantly contaminated by previously unresolved AGN, and four appear to be AGN misclassified as clusters.


#### [The Active Assembly of the Virgo Cluster: Indications for Recent Group Infall From Early-Type Dwarf Galaxies](https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.04751)

    * we find an intriguing behavior of early types with magnitudes −17 ≥ Mr ≥ −18. They show a large velocity spread and an asymmetric phase-space distribution, similar to the late-type galaxies and different from the early types just one magnitude brighter/fainter.
    * close phase-space aggregation of early-type dwarfs at large clustercentric distance and high relative velocity: 相空间上有聚集，但物理空间里看不到聚集，很可能是infalling group的证据
    * Nearly all of them show signatures of disk components and their colors imply stellar ages that are younger than the population average. They are not located closely together but spread azimuthally around the cluster center. We show that this is expected from simulations of an infalling galaxy group that slowly gets dispersed af- ter its first pericentric passage


#### [The orientation of galaxy pairs with filamentary structures: dependence on morphology](https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.04762)
    * With the aim of performing an analysis of the orientations of galaxy pair systems with respect to the underlying large-scale structure, we study the alignment between the axis connecting the pair galaxies and the host cosmic filament where the pair resides.
    * We find a statistically significant alignment signal between the pair axes and the spine of the host filaments consistent with a relative excess of ∼ 15% aligned pairs. We obtain that pairs composed by elliptical galaxies exhibit a stronger alignment, showing a higher alignment signal for pairs closer than 200 h−1 kpc to the filament spine.

#### [New Constraints on IGM Thermal Evolution from the Lyα Forest Power Spectrum](https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.04367)
    * We conduct Bayesian inference of IGM thermal parameters using an end-to-end forward modeling framework whereby mock spectra generated from our simulation grid are used to build a custom emulator which interpolates the power spectrum between thermal grid points.
    * The temperature at mean density T0 rises steadily from T0 ∼ 6000K at z = 5.4, peaks at 14000K for z ∼ 3.4, and decreases at lower redshift reaching T0 ∼ 7000 K by z ∼ 1.8. This evolution provides conclusive evidence for photoionization heating resulting from the reionization of He II
    * Our results are broadly consistent with previous measurements of thermal evolution based on a variety of approaches, but the sensitivity of the power spectrum

#### [Studying the [OIII]λ5007A emission-line width in a sample of ∼80 local active galaxies: A surrogate for σ⋆?](https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.04821)
    * Fitting the [OIII] line with a single Gaussian or Gauss-Hermite polynomials overestimates σ⋆ by 50-100%.
    * When line asymmetries from non-gravitational gas motion are excluded in a double Gaussian fit, the average ratio between the core [OIII] width (σ[OIII],D) and σ⋆ is ∼1, but with individual data points off by up to a factor of two.
    * However, a direct comparison between σ⋆ and σ[OIII],D shows no close correlation, only that both quantities have the same range, average and standard deviation, probably because they feel the same gravitational potential.

    * Abundances of OH+ and H2O+ are useful for inferring ζH cosmic ray ionization rate when combined with chemical models: 宇宙线在超新星遗迹里加速，所以电离rate应该和SFR相关
    * The observed OH+ and H2O+ absorption is thought to arise in massive, extended halos of cool, diffuse gas that surround these galaxies.
    * As our estimates come from gas that is far away from the sites of cosmic-ray acceleration, they imply that cosmic-ray ionization rates in the compact regions where star formation occurs in these galaxies are orders of magnitude higher.

    * Out of this sample 15 are identified as extreme oxygen emitters based on their [O iii]/[O ii] ratios (3.7%) and 104 galaxies have [O iii]/[O ii] > 1 (26%).
    * We find a decrease in the fraction of galaxies with [O iii]/[O ii] > 1 with increasing M∗ , however, this is most likely a result of the relationship between [O iii]/[O ii] and metallicity, rather than between [Oiii]/[Oii] and M∗.

    * 关于SF“主序”： A turnover in the sequence has been observed, where galaxies with M∗ < 10^10 M⊙ follow a steeper relation than their higher mass counterparts, suggesting that the low-mass slope is (nearly) linear.
    * We find a sub-linear slope for the low-mass regime, increasing with redshift. We recover an intrinsic scatter in the relation, larger than typically found at higher masses.
    * As both hydrodynamical simulations and (semi-)analytical models typically favour a steeper slope in the low-mass regime, our results provide new constraints on the feedback processes which operate preferentially in low-mass halos.

    * We present a novel automatic method of optimizing photometric redshift performance, the classification-aided photometric redshift estimation (CPz). The main feature of CPz is the unified treatment of all classes of objects detected in extragalactic surveys: galaxies of any type (passive, starforming and starbursts), active galactic nuclei (AGN), quasi-stellar objects (QSO), stars and also includes the identification of potential photometric redshift catastrophic outliers.

    * We analyze differences in positions of active galactic nuclei between Gaia data release 2 and VLBI and compare the significant VLBI-to-Gaia offsets in more than 1000 objects with their jet directions. At least 3/4 of the significant offsets are confirmed to occur downstream or upstream the jet representing a genuine astrophysical effect.
    * The observed behaviour of the different AGN classes is consistent with the unified scheme assuming varying contribution of the obscuring dusty torus and jet beaming.


#### [Dramatic X-ray spectral variability of a Compton-thick type-1 QSO at z∼1](https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.05207)

Five years later, Chandra captured the source in a heavily-obscured, reflection-dominated state.

    * We assess whether one of the more controversial aspects of our model, a top-heavy initial mass function (IMF) for galaxies undergoing dynamically-triggered bursts of star formation, is necessary in order to reproduce the EBL, and find that variant models with a universal solar-neighborhood IMF cannot produce as good agree- ment with EBL observations over the whole UV-to-mm spectrum.

    * At z > 1.0, the NIR-selected source density is higher by a factor 1.4 and therefore the scatter in NIR-derived ellipticities is about 30% smaller, implying a more precise ellipticity measurement.

    * new measurements of the large-scale (≈ 40 comoving Mpc) effective optical depth of He II Lyα absorption, τeff, at 2.54 < z < 3.86 toward 16 He II-transparent quasars
    * We confirm that the median τeff increases from ≃ 2 at z = 2.7 to a limit τeff   5 at z > 3, and that the scatter in τeff increases with redshift.
    * At z > 3.5 we observe predominantly saturated He II absorption, but several isolated narrow (∆v < 650 km s−1) transmission spikes indicate patches of fully reionized helium at these early epochs.
    * At z > 2.74 the variance in the observed τeff significantly exceeds expectations for a spatially uniform He II-ionizing background, but is in good agreement with a fluctuating radiation field that is due to stochasticity in the quasar number density and spatial variations of the mean free path to He II-ionizing photons in the post-reionization IGM

    * the gas in these absorbers is largely ionized, and the ionization conditions are quite comparable across the sampled NH I range.
    * The Mg II column densities span > 2 orders of magnitude at any given NH I, indicating a wide range of metallicities (from solar to < 1/100 solar)
    * Less than 3% of the absorbers in our sample show no detectable metal absorption, implying truly-pristine gas at z <1 is uncommon.


#### [[OII] as a proxy for star formation in AGN host galaxies: beware of extended emission line regions](https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.05421)
    * Here, we identify EELRs by the presence of the [Ne v] 3426 ̊A emission line, which, like [O ii], is not strongly excited in the inner regions of AGN, but is a prominent emission line in the lower density EELRs.
    * Critically, unlike [O ii], [Ne v] is not excited by star formation. Therefore, when strong [Nev] is present in an AGN spectrum, the flux from the EELR is not negligible, implying the [O ii] flux is contaminated by emission from the EELR


#### [The impact of bars and interactions on optically selected AGNs in spiral galaxies](https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.05536)

    * We also found that the fractions of AGNs with powerful nuclear activity and high accretion rates increase toward more massive hosts with bluer colors and younger stellar populations

    * 5 Mpc内的12个星系：Using NuSTAR color-intensity and color-color diagrams we classify 43 of these sources as candidate NS and 47 as candidate BH. We further subdivide BH by accretion states (soft, intermediate, and hard) and NS by weak (Z/Atoll) and strong (accreting pulsar) magnetic field.
    * Using 8 normal (Milky Way-type) galaxies in the sample, we confirm the relation between SFR and galaxy X-ray point source luminosity


#### [Testing the uniqueness of gravitational lens mass models](https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.05619)
    * Here, we concentrate on the azimuthal mass asymmetries near the image circle.
    * We ask if galaxies that have mass asymmetries beyond ellipticity can be modeled with simpler lenses
    * for galaxies with elliptical stellar and dark matter distributions, but with no mass asymmetry, and an extended source filling the diamond caustic, an elliptical+shear lens model can re- produce the images well, thereby hiding the potential complexity


#### [Deceleration of CIV and SiIV broad absorption lines in X-ray bright quasar SDSS-J092345+512710](https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.05622)
    * report a synchronized kinematic shift of C iv and Si iv broad absorption lines (BAL) in a high- ionization, radio-loud, and X-ray bright quasar SDSS-J092345+512710 (at zem ∼ 2.1627)
    * The absorption profiles of C iv and Si iv BAL of the blue component show decrease in outflow velocity with an average deceleration rate of −1.62+0.04 cm s−2 and −1.14+0.21 cm s−2 over a rest-frame time-span of 4.15 yr.
    * We suggest the observed variability could be related to the time dependent changes in disk wind parameters like launching radius, initial flow velocity or mass outflow rate.


#### [Cooling in the X-ray halo of the rotating, massive early-type galaxy NGC 7049](https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.05761)
    - **Relevant**
    * The central entropy of the hot gas permeating this fast-rotating galaxy is unusually high and it remains systemically higher than that in most non-rotating massive galaxies at all investigated radii.
    * The hot gas in the plane of rotation of the cool dusty disc has a multi-temperature structure, consistent with ongoing cooling.
    * We conclude that the rotational support of the hot gas is likely capable of altering the multiphase condensation regardless of the tcool/tff ratio
        - Apart from affecting the X-ray luminosities and shapes of the hot atmospheres (Brighenti & Mathews 1996, 1997; Hanlan & Bregman 2000; Machacek et al. 2010), rotation should also influence the conditions that govern thermal instabilities in the hot gas.


#### [Connecting Compact Star-forming and Extended Star-forming Galaxies at Low-redshift: Implications for Galaxy Compaction and Quenching](https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.05929)
    * we aim at examining the possible evolutionary link between eSFGs and cSFGs by identifying the trends in star formation rate (SFR), gas-phase metallicity and HI content, since one would naturally expect that galaxies evolve along the track of cold gas consumption and metal enhancement.
    * The cSFGs on average exhibit similar or slightly higher SFRs of ∼0.06 dex and significantly higher gas-phase metallicity (up to 0.2 dex at low mass) with respect to the eSFGs, while the cSFGs dominate the galaxy population of the most intense star formation activities.
    * More importantly, overall the median HI content and gas depletion time of cSFGs are about half of eSFGs.

    * 一个z=0.78的QSO的LLS系统的MUSE观测：Using MUSE observations we
detect one galaxy close to the absorption redshift at an impact parameter of 54 kpc.
    * By combining the absorption line kinematics with the host galaxy morphokinematics we find that while the main absorption component can originate from a galactic wind at Vw = 110 ± 4 km s−1 the weaker components cannot.
    * we expect this gas will remain bound to the host galaxy


#### [Consequences of the external field effect for MOND disk galaxies in galaxy clusters](https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.05962)
    * In this study, we examine the purely gravitational interaction of idealised galaxy models falling into a galaxy cluster in the context of Modified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND).
    * We examine the consequences of the EFE on low and high mass disk galaxies in time-evolving analytic background cluster potentials, considering orbits with weak and strong tidal fields. By varying the orbital plane of the galaxies we also test the effect of having the tidal interaction orthogonal or parallel to the disk.
    * Our results suggest that MOND cluster galaxies should exhibit clear asymmetries in their isophotes, suffer increased mass loss and a reduction in their rotation curves due to the combined effect of cluster tides and the external field
        - About simulation using MOND: Several such codes are now available, such as PoR (Lüghausen et al. 2015), N-MODY (Londrillo and Nipoti 2009) and a MOND version of the cosmological code AMIGA (Llinares et al. 2008). In this work we will use the MOND N-body/hydrodynamics code known as RAyMOND (Candlish et al. 2015), which is based upon the RAMSES code (Teyssier 2002). This code has previously been used to study possible signals of MOND gravity in cosmological structure formation (Candlish 2016)

#### [KUG 0200-096: Dwarf antennae hosting a tidal dwarf galaxy](https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.06166)
    * We identify a young stellar clump of stellar mass of 2×10^7 M⊙ at the tip of the antenna, possibly a Tidal Dwarf Galaxy (TDG).
    * Evidence of merger between the dwarf galaxy pair is also presence in HI kinematics and morphology where we find the HI contents of interacting pair is disturbed, forming a extended tail toward the TDG.
    - There has been growing interest in the dwarf- dwarf interaction in recent literatures and in the last few years number of studies have presented observational evidences of the merging dwarf galaxies (Paudel et al. 2015; Stierwalt et al. 2015; Pearson et al. 2016; Martinez-Delgado et al. 2012).

#### [Dark matter heats up in dwarf galaxies](https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.06634)
    * We use stellar kinematics and HI gas rotation curves to infer the inner dark matter densities of eight dwarf spheroidal and eight dwarf irregular galaxies with a wide range of star formation histories.
    * We find that our sample of dwarfs falls into two distinct classes.:
        - 6 Gyr以前停止SF的那些更符合DM cusp；还在形成恒星的那些更符合DM core
    * we show that this dichotomy is in excellent agreement with models in which dark matter is heated up by bursty star formation.


#### [The X-ray/UV ratio in Active Galactic Nuclei: dispersion and variability](https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.06964)
    * We want to quantify the contribution of variability within single sources (intra-source dispersion) and that due to variations of other quantities different from source to source (inter-source dispersion).


#### [Accurate radial velocity and metallicity of the Large Magellanic Cloud old globular clusters NGC 1928 and NGC 1939](https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.06983)
    - **Relevant**
    * GMOS and AAOmega+2dF spectrographs to obtain spectra centred on the Ca II triplet, from which we derived individual radial velocities (RVs) and metallicities.
    * We found that both GCs have RVs and positions consistent with being part of the LMC disc, so that we rule out any possible origin but that in the same galaxy.
    * We found that 11/15 of the GCs share the LMC rotation derived from HST and Gaia DR2 proper motions. This outcome reveals that the LMC disc existed since the very early epoch of the galaxy formation and experienced the steep relatively fast chemical enrichment shown by its GC metallicities. 剩下的四个很可能是从SMC吸积来的


#### [Chandra Follow-Up of the SDSS DR8 redMaPPer Catalog Using the MATCha Pipeline](https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.06637)
    - **Useful, Relevant**
    * To this end, we introduce the Mass Analysis Tool for Chandra (MATCha), a pipeline which uses a parallellized algorithm to analyze archival Chandra data.
    * We run MATCha on the redMaPPer SDSS DR8 cluster catalog and use MATCha’s output X-ray temperatures and luminosities
    * We detect 447 clusters and determine 246 r2500 temperatures across all redshifts.
    * T_X和lambda的log-log关系斜率0.52，sigma=0.27
    * We investigate the distribution of offsets between the X-ray center and redMaPPer center within 0.1 < z < 0.35, finding that 68.3 ± 6.5% of clusters are well-centered.


#### [Spatial Distribution of Metals in the ICM: Evolution of the Iron Excess in Relaxed Galaxy Clusters](https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.06742)
    - **Interesting**
    * Spatial distribution of iron in the intra-cluster medium in a selected sample of 41 relaxed clusters in the redshift range 0.05 < z < 1.03 using Chandra archival data.
    * azimuthally-averaged, deprojected ZFe profile of each cluster out to ∼ 0.4r500, and identify a peak in the distribution of iron followed by a flatter distribution at larger radii.
    * spatial distribution of iron in the ICM extends with time, possibly due to the mixing with the mechanical-mode feedback from the central galaxy.


#### [Dust in galaxy clusters: Modeling at millimeter wavelengths and impact on Planck cluster cosmology](https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.06807)
    - **Interesting**
    * We have examined dust emission in galaxy clusters at millimeter wavelengths using the Planck 857 GHz map to constrain the model based on Herschel observations
    * Stacking: we estimated the normalization of the infrared luminosity versus mass relation and constrained the spatial profile of the dust emission.
    * 用得到的模型模拟Planck的尘埃加气体的星系团信号：The comparison between clusters extracted using these gas+dust simulations and the basic gas-only simulations allows us to assess the impact of cluster dust emission on Planck results.
    * We show that dust emission has a negligible effect on the recovery of individual cluster parameters for the Planck mission, but that it impacts the cluster catalog completeness, reducing the number of detections in the redshift range [0.3-0.8] by up to ∼ 9%.
    * 对宇宙学参数影响不大：it does not ease the tension between Planck cluster and primary cosmic microwave background cosmologies.

#### [A census of galaxy constituents in a Coma Progenitor observed at z>3](https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.07065)
    - **Interesting, Relevant**
    * Diverse galaxy types identified in the field include Lyα emitters (LAEs), massive star-forming galaxies, and ultra-massive galaxies (>10^11M⊙) which may have already halted their star formation.
    * The sky distribution of the star-forming galaxies suggests the presence of a significant overdensity (δSFG ≈ 8±2)
    * Candidate quiescent and post-starburst galaxies are also found in large excess (a factor of ∼8–15 higher surface density than the field)
    * Overdensity可能来自于另一个proto-cluster，或者就是这个proto-cluster的质量更大；both scenarios are equally unlikely (< 1%), particularly in the cosmic volume probed in our survey.
    * Finally, we find that the protocluster galaxies follow the same SFR-Mstar scaling relation as the field galaxies, suggesting that the environmental effect at z ∼ 4 is a subtle one at best for normal star-forming galaxies.


#### [Scaling of X-ray spectral properties of a black hole in the Seyfert 1 galaxy NGC~7469](https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.07091)

#### [Delayed Stellar Mass Assembly in the Low Surface Brightness Dwarf Galaxy KDG215](https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.07108)
    - **Interesting, Relevant**
    * The HI images from VLA reveal a dispersion dominated ISM with only weak signatures of coherent rotation.
    * Although KDG 215 is gas-rich, the Hα non-detection implies a very low current massive star formation rate.
    * 通过HST图像： The recent star formation history shows a peak star formation rate ∼1 Gyr ago, followed by a decreasing star formation rate to the present day quiescent state.
    * While the ancient stellar population (predominantly red giants) is prominent, the look-back time by which 50% of the mass of all stars ever formed had been created is among the youngest of any known galaxy.


#### [The Spatially Resolved Dust-to-Metals Ratio in M101](https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.07164)
    * M101的金属丰度梯度比较大, 1 dex 左右
    * 利用FIR SED拟合尘埃，考虑不同的尘埃辐射模型：Among them, the model with a single temperature blackbody modified by a broken power-law emissivity gives the statistically best fit and physically most plausible results.
    * Using these results, we show that the dust- to-gas ratio is proportional to Z^{1.7}. This implies that the dust-to-metals ratio is not constant in M101, but decreases as a function of radius, equivalent to a lower fraction of metals trapped in dust at low metallicity (large radius).
    * This change of dust-to-metals ratio is significantly correlated with molecular hydrogen fraction, which suggests that the accretion of gas phase metals onto existing dust grains could be a mechanism contributing to a variable dust-to- metals ratio.


#### [From Giant H II regions and H II galaxies to globular clusters and compact dwarf ellipticals](https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.07186)
    * We model the photometric and dynamical evolution over a Hubble time of the massive gravitationally bound systems that populate the tight relation between abso- lute blue magnitude and velocity dispersion (MB −σ) of GHIIR and HIIG
    * We interpret our result as an indication that the YMC that ionize GHIIR and HIIG can evolve to form globular clusters and ultra compact dwarf ellipticals in about 12 Gyr so that present day globular clusters and ultra compact dwarf ellipticals may have formed in conditions similar to those observed in today GHIIR and HIIG.


#### [Black Hole Fundamental Plane in Low-Excitation Radio Galaxies](https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.07188)
    * The radio-X-ray slope in the fundamental plane of radio-loud active galactic nuclei (AGNs) is found to be steeper compared with that of radio-quiet AGNs in previous works.
    * we reinvestigate the fundamental plane in radio-loud AGNs by compiling a sample of 13 low-excitation radio galaxies (LERG) from the 3CR radio galaxies 一般认为LERG通过RIAF吸积
    * Surprisingly, we find the slope in the fundamental plane (logLR = 0.52 log LX + 0.84 log MBH + 10.84) of LERG is well consistent with that reported by Merloni et al. (2003).
    * However, the normalization is found to be shifted by about 0.7 dex, which can be due to the difference on magnetic field strength in different objects.

    * A number of giant cometary HII regions (cones) (GCH) sheathed inside molecular bow shocks (MBS) are found along spiral arms of the barred galaxy M83.
    * The open cone structure is explained by a model of expanded HII front in a gaseous arm with steep density gradient


#### [Broad-line region structure and line profile variations in the changing look AGN HE1136-2304](https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.07331)
    * The outer line wings of all BLR lines respond much faster to continuum variations indicating an Keplerian disk component for the BLR. The response in the outer wings is about two light days shorter than the response of the adjacent continuum flux with respect to the ionizing continuum flux.
    * the variability behavior of this changing look AGN is similar to that of other AGN.

    * We identify several analysis choices that can shift the cosmological constraints by a significant fraction of the uncertainties.
    * From the goodness-of-fit and the Bayesian evidence ratio, we determine that amongst the four surveys, the two more recent surveys, DES-SV and KiDS-450, have acceptable goodness-of-fit and are consistent with each other.

    * With up to an order of magnitude lower polarization noise than maps from the Planck satellite, the high-resolution sky maps will constrain cosmological parameters derived from the damping tail, gravitational lensing of the microwave background, the primordial bispectrum, and the thermal and kinematic Sunyaev– Zel’dovich effects, and will aid in delensing the large-angle polarization signal to measure the tensor-to-scalar ratio.

    * We confirm previous results that radio galaxies are on average X-ray-louder than radio-quiet AGNs, but find that their spectral slopes are very similar.
    * hard X-rays are produced in the same region and by the same mechanism. We argue that this region can be associated with the hot, geometrically thick, central portion of the accretion flow, where production of hard X-rays is likely to be dominated by Comptonization of the optical/UV radiation of the truncated ’cold’ accretion disc by hot electrons.

    * We present structural parameters and morphological properties of faint 450-μm selected submillimeter galaxies (SMGs) from the JCMT Large Program, STUDIES, in the COSMOS-CANDELS region.
    * 用HST图像看450micron挑选的星系的结构; 这些是faint SMG：half of such faint SMGs lie above the star-formation rate (SFR)/stellar mass plane.
    * these SMGs are generally similar to less-luminous star-forming galaxies selected by NUV−r vs. r−J colors in mass-size relation.
    * Both SMGs and the matched galaxies show high fractions (∼70%) of disturbed features at z ≃ 2, and the fractions depend on the SFRs.


#### [SMA Observations of Extended CO(J=2−1) Emission in Interacting Galaxy NGC 3627](https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.07483)
    * These SMA mosaic maps of NGC 3627 reveal a prominent nuclear peak, inter-arm regions, and diffuse, extended emission in the spiral arms.
    * We also detect unresolved 13CO(J = 2−1) line emission toward the nuclear region, southern bar end, and in a relatively isolated clump in the southern portion of the galaxy.
    * From this density modeling, we find a total H2 mass of 9.6 × 10^9 M⊙, which is ∼50% higher than previous estimates made using a constant H2–CO conversion factor but is largely dependent on the assumed vertical distribution of the CO gas.


#### [Sculpting Andromeda -- made-to-measure models for M31's bar and composite bulge: dynamics, stellar and dark matter mass](https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.07494)
    * We construct made-to-measure models fitting new VIRUS-W IFU bulge stel-
lar kinematic observations, the IRAC-3.6μm photometry, and the disc’s H I rotation curve.
    * The best model has two bulge components with completely different kinematics that only together successfully reproduce the observations (μ3.6, υlos, σlos, h3, h4).

    * We could not see any significant difference in half-life values at 2500 eV by increasing the size of the carbon backbone for PAH molecules with number of carbons, NC, from 10 to 16. An enrichment of doubly charged ions caused by photo-selection is also observed

#### [Tracing Outflowing Metals in Simulations of Dwarf and Spiral Galaxies](https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.07872)
    * 高分辨率模拟：agree with the observed stellar and gas-phase mass-metallicity relation, an agreement that relies on large fractions of the produced metals escaping into the CGM.
    * In many cases, these metals are spread far beyond the virial radius. 
    * We find that between 40 and 80% of all metals removed from the galactic disk are later reaccreted. The outflows themselves are metal enriched relative to the ISM by a factor of 0.2 dex because of the correspondence between sites of metal enrichment and outflows.

    * H2-bearing damped Lyman-α absorber (DLA) at zabs = 2.05 towards the quasar FBQS J2340-0053.
    * We conclude that the DLA is subjected to the metagalactic background radiation and cosmic ray ionization rate of ∼10^{−15.37} s−1. Dust grains in this DLA are smaller than grains in the Galactic interstellar medium.
    * Micro-turbulent pressure is a significant constituent of the total pressure, and can play an important role in these innermost regions


#### [Tidal stripping as a mechanism for placing globular clusters on wide orbits: the case of MGC1 in M31](https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.08087)
    * We test this numerically by comparing the contribution of globular clusters from simulated encounters to the observed M31 globular cluster population.
    * The remote location of MGC1 favours the idea of it being captured, however, the cluster is devoid of features associated with tidal interactions.
    * we find that tidal stripping of clusters from dwarf galaxies leaves them on orbits having a range of separations, broadly matching those observed in M31.
    * Furthermore, in our simulations we find an equal num- ber of accreted clusters on co-rotating and counter-rotating orbits within M31 and use this to infer the fraction of clusters that has been accreted.


#### [Observing the influence of growing black holes on the pre-reionization IGM](https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.08137)
    * We show that the influence regions for hydrogen increase to 10kpc (physical length) for non-growing BHs to more than 0.3–1Mpc for accreting BHs, the influence regions are ten times smaller for singly ionized helium.
    * We show that the 21cm emitting region around a growing BH could produce brightness temperatures ≃ 15mK across an evolving structure of 1Mpc in size with hot, ionized gas closer to the BH and much cooler in outer regions.
    * 3HeII emission from regions surrounding the growing BH is weak: the corresponding brightness temperatures reaches tens of nano-Kelvin, which is below the range of upcoming SKA1-MED.

#### [`Upper-Limit Lensing': Constraining galaxy stellar masses with singly-imaged background sources](https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.08235)
    - **Interesting**
    * we present a method to derive upper limits on Υ in galaxies with single close-projected background sources, where no counter-image is detected, down to some relative flux limit.
    * In our first case study, only a weak constraint on Υ is obtained. In the second, the absence of a detectable counter-image excludes stellar masses higher than expected for a Salpeter IMF.
    * We discuss how our method can help enlarge the current samples of low-z galaxies with lensing constraints, both by adding upper limits on Υ and by guiding follow-up of promising single-image systems in search of fainter counter-images.

    * We report the first sub-kiloparsec spatial resolution measurements of strongly inverted gas-phase metallicity gradients in two dwarf galaxies at z∼2
    * Our galaxies are currently undergoing rapid mass assembly via disk inside-out growth. More importantly, using a simple chemical evolution model, we find that the gas fractions for different metallicity regions cannot be explained by pure gas accretion
    * A spatial map of net gaseous outflows, triggered by active central starbursts, that potentially play a significant role in shaping the spatial distribution of metallicity by effectively transporting stellar nucleosynthesis yields outwards.
    * Single type of wind mechanism, driven by either energy or momentum conservation, cannot explain the entire galaxy.

        - The major eigenvectors of the inertia momentum tensors of the proto-galaxies correspond to the most elongated axes of their shapes, while the minor eigenvectors of the large-scale tidal tensors correspond to the directions along which the surrounding matter become minimally compressed.
    * An effective analytic model that can explain both of the tidally induced shape and spin alignments of the galactic halos with the large-scale tidal fields.

    * Here we report the detection of a new ultra-fast outflow (UFO) with a velocity of vout = 0.319+0.005c in addition to a relativistic disk reflection −0.008 component in a poorly studied NLS1 WKK 4438
    * The disk is accreting at a high Eddington ratio (Lbol = 0.4 − 0.7LEdd ). The mass outflow rate of the UFO is comparable with the disk mass inflow rate 


#### [Variable Nature of Magnetically-Driven Ultra-Fast Outflows](https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.08935)
    * Among a number of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) that drive ionized outflows in X-rays, a low-redshift (z = 0.184) quasar, PDS 456, is long known to exhibit one of the exemplary ultra-fast outflows (UFOs).
    * We model the variations of the Fe K UFO properties in PDS 456 over many epochs in X-ray observations in the context of magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) accretion-disk winds
    * This work demonstrates that UFOs, even without radiative pressure, can be driven as an extreme case purely by magnetic interaction while also producing the observed spectrum and correlations.
