#### [Precision Pollution - The effects of enrichment yields and timing on galactic chemical evolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.00007)
    * Attribution of the galaxy-scale abundance patterns to individual enrichment mechanisms such as the winds from asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars or the presence of a prompt fraction of Type Ia supernovae is complicated by the interaction between them and gas cooling, subsequent star formation and gas ejection.
    * Delay time distribution: DTD; We find DTDs with a large prompt fraction (such as the bimodal and power-law models) have, at z = 0, similar abundance patterns compared to the low-prompt component time distributions (uniform or wide Gaussian models).
    * 但是两个情形的 [X/Fe] ratio和铁丰度演化不同


#### [Uncorrelated velocity and size residuals across galaxy rotation curves](https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.00271)
    - **Relevant, Interesting**
    * We study the coupling of the Tully–Fisher and mass–size relations both in observations (the SPARC sample) and in empirical galaxy formation models based on halo abundance matching.
    * 看TF关系和mass-size relation的residuls之间在不同半径上的相关:We find no significant correlation in either the data or models for any r. 
    * We do however find evidence for an anticorrelation of galaxy size with halo concentration at fixed baryonic mass


#### [Analyzing interferometric observations of strong gravitational lenses with recurrent and convolutional neural networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.00011)
    - **Useful, Interesting**
    * training a feed-forward CNN on dirty images, and find that neural networks can simultaneously adapt to dirty images generated from vastly different uv-coverages.
    * we use the recurrent inference machine (RIM) introduced in Putzky & Welling (2017). This provides a fast and automated alternative to the traditional CLEAN algorithm.

#### [Stellar Radiation is Critical for Regulating Star Formation and Driving Outflows in Low Mass Dwarf Galaxies](https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.00468)
    * However, it has been recently suggested that pre-SN feedback, from either stellar winds or stellar radiation, is necessary in high-resolution simulations of galaxy evolution to properly regulate star formation and properties of the interstellar medium (ISM).
    * 一般模拟只是说让新生恒星周围的dense分子云被摧毁
    * we use high resolution simulations (1.8 pc) of an isolated dwarf galaxy with detailed stellar feedback tracked on a star-by-star basis.
    * We find that including ionizing radiation reduces the star formation rate by over a factor of 5, and is necessary in creating the ISM conditions needed for supernovae to drive significant outflows.


#### [A Galaxy-Scale Fountain of Cold Molecular Gas Pumped by a Black Hole](https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.00473)
    - **Interesting, Relevant**
    * A2597中间超大质量分子云filament的ALMA+MUSE观测
    * Its warm ionized and cold molecular components are both cospatial and comoving, consistent with the hypothesis that the optical nebula traces the warm envelopes of many cold molecular clouds
    * The clouds are not in dynamical equilibrium, and instead show evidence for inflow toward the central supermassive black hole, outflow along the jets it launches, and uplift by the buoyant hot bubbles those jets inflate.
    * a galaxy-spanning “fountain”, wherein cold gas clouds drain into the black hole accretion reservoir, powering jets and bubbles that uplift a cooling plume of low-entropy multiphase gas, which may stimulate additional cooling and accretion as part of a self-regulating feedback loop


#### [The Massively Accreting Cluster A2029](https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.00488)
    - **Relevant**
    * The complete redshift survey of A2029 also identifies at least 12 foreground and background systems (10 are extended X-ray sources)
    * 附近有A2033和Southern Infalling Group两个主要substructure，质量都不小
    * Simple dynamical considerations suggest that A2029 will accrete these subsystems in next few Gyr.


#### [OMEGA - OSIRIS Mapping of Emission-line Galaxies in A901/2: IV. - Extinction of Star-Formation Estimators with Inclination](https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.00530)
    * study the effect of inclination on the apparent brightness of star-forming galaxies in spectral passbands that are commonly used as star-formation indicators
    * 使用了tunable-filter imaging 
    * we find trends in the UV and Hα mass-to-light ratio that suggest an inclination-induced attenuation from face-on to edge-on of ∼ 1 mag and ∼ 0.7 mag in UV and Hα, respectively, implying that star-formation rates of edge-on galaxies would be underestimated by ∼ 2.5× in UV and ∼ 2× in Hα.

#### [Galaxy Structure in the Ultraviolet: The Dependence of Morphological Parameters on Rest-Frame Wavelength](https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.00577)
    * We find a relationship between the CAS parameters and observed rest-frame wavelength that make galaxies appear more late-type at shorter wavelengths, particularly in the UV
    * The effect is strongest for E/S0 galaxies in the far-UV, which have concentrations and asymmetries that more resemble those of spiral and peculiar/merging galaxies in the optical.

#### [Supermassive black holes with high accretion rates in active galactic nuclei. VII. Reconstruction of velocity-delay maps by maximum entropy method](https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.00705)
    * we apply the maximum entropy method (MEM) to 9 narrow-line Seyfert 1 galaxies with super-Eddington accretion rates observed during 2012-2013 for the velocity-delay maps of their Hβ and Hγ emission lines.
    * These super-Eddington accretors show diverse geometry and kinematics.

## August 5:

#### [The QUEST-La Silla AGN variability survey: connection between AGN variability and black hole physical properties](https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.00967)
    * We found that the amplitude of the variability (A) depends solely on the rest frame emission wavelength and the Eddington ratio, where A anti-correlates with both λrest and L/LEdd.
        - Its amplitude is inversely related to the accretion rate.
    * For 20.6% of the variable sources in our sample, a DRW model is not appropriate to describe the variability


#### [Stellar Feedback and the Energy Budget of Late-Type Galaxies: Missing Baryons and Core Creation](https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.00971)
    * By fitting halo profiles to the rotation curves of galaxies in the SPARC data set, we measure the “missing baryon” mass for individual late-type systems.
    * we show that the maximum energy available from supernovae is typically not enough to completely eject these “missing baryons” from a halo, but it is often sufficient to heat them to the virial temperature.
    * the energy available from supernova feedback is always enough to convert a primordial cusp into a core and has magnitude consistent with what is required to heat the “missing baryons” to the virial temperature.

#### [Witnessing galaxy assembly at the edge of the reionization epoch](https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.01146)
    * Serenity-18, a galaxy at z ≃ 5.939 for which we could measure the content of molecular gas; 还有 gas clump/filament which is possibly feeding its growth
    * The metal poor gas is detected through a damped Lyman-α absorber observed at a spatial separation of 40 kpc and at the same redshift


#### [Low-luminosity AGN and X-ray binary populations in COSMOS star-forming galaxies](https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.00970)
    * X-ray stacking analysis of ∼75,000 star-forming galaxies between 0.1 < z < 5.0 using the Chandra COSMOS Legacy survey to study the X-ray emission of low-luminosity active galactic nuclei (AGN)
    * Comparing the measured luminosities to established XRB scaling relations, we find that the redshift evolution of the luminosity per star formation rate (SFR) of XRBs depends sensitively on the assumed obscuration
    * After subtracting the estimated XRB contribution from the stacks, we find that most stacks at z > 1.3 exhibit a significant X-ray excess indicating nuclear emission. The AGN emission is strongly correlated with stellar mass but does not exhibit an additional correlation with SFR.
    * The hardness ratios of the high-redshift stacks indicate that the AGN are substantially obscured

## August 6:

#### [Black Hole - Galaxy Scaling Relationships for Active Galactic Nuclei with Reverberation Masses](https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.01329)
    - **Important**
    * We have separated the host galaxy from the bright central AGN, allowing a re-examination of the MBH − Lbulge and MBH − Lgalaxy relationships and the MBH − Mbulge and MBH − Mstars relationships using V-H color to constrain the stellar mass-to-light ratio. 
    * We also find good agreement with the expectations from the Illustris simulations, although the agreement with other simulations is less clear because of the different black hole mass ranges that are probed.
    * MBH − Lbulge is found to have the least scatter, and is therefore the best predictor of MBH among the relationships examined here.
    * We have examined MBH/Mstars and find a clear trend with black hole mass but not galaxy mass.


#### [On the influence of environment on star forming galaxies](https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.01628)
    * GAEA SAM研究
    * We analyse the origin of differences between physical properties of satellites and those of their central counterparts, identified by matching the Vmax of their host haloes at the accretion time of the satellites.
    * In contrast, our model predicts larger differences with respect to data for the molecular gas mass and star formation rate.
        - that differences in the gas content arise after accretion, and can be entirely ascribed to the instantaneous strip- ping of the hot gas reservoir.
    * We argue that these disagreements could be largely resolved with the inclusion of a proper treatment for ram-pressure stripping of cold gas and a more gradual stripping of the hot gas reservoir. 


#### [ALMA 12CO (J=1--0) imaging of the nearby galaxy M83: Variations in the efficiency of star formation in giant molecular clouds](https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.01702)
    * In the eastern arm, the CO peaks form two arc-shaped ridges that run along the arm and exhibit a distinct difference in the activity of star formation: the one on the leading side has numerous H II regions associated with it, whereas the other one on the trailing side has only a few.


#### [An early-type galaxy with an inner star-forming disk](https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.01730)
    * We report a discovery of an ETG (SDSS J142055.01+400715.7) with M∗=10^10 M⊙ that offers direct evidence for gas-rich merging as the origin of low-mass ETGs.
    * Furthermore, the inner disk harbors on-going star formation, indicating the merging to be gas rich. 


#### [GAMA/G10-COSMOS/3D-HST: Evolution of the galaxy stellar mass function over 12.5Gyrs](https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.01754)
    - **Relevant, Important**
    * Surprisingly, when fitting a two-component Schechter function, we find essentially no evidence of temporal evolution in M⋆, the two α slope parameters, or the normalisation of the low-mass component.
    * Instead, our fits suggest that the various shape parameters have been exceptionally stable over cosmic time, as has the normalisation of the low- mass component, and that the evolution of the stellar-mass function is well described by a simple build up of the high-mass component over time.
    * Finally, we find that the evolution of the stellar-mass function, and the observed stellar mass density, can be well described by a simple model of constant growth in the high-mass source density


#### [Revealing Dusty Supernovae in High-Redshift (Ultra-)Luminous InfraRed Galaxies Through Near-Infrared Integrated Light Variability](https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.01780)
    * 在高红移ULIRGS里找SN: to search for the presence of supernovae through the variability of the integrated restframe infrared light of the entire hosts.
    * We obtain a sample of (U)LIRGs that have secure optical counterparts, and examine their light curves in 3–5 μm in the IRAC Dark Field (IDF), 有14年的数据
    * We present two cases where the distinct features in their light curves are consistent with multiple supernovae overlapping in time.


#### [CANDELSz7: a large spectroscopic survey of CANDELS galaxies in the reionization epoch](https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.01847)
    * results of CANDELSz7, an ESO large program aimed at confirming spectroscopically a homogeneous sample of z≃6 and z≃7 star forming galaxies.
    * FORS2 12-20小时的光谱
    * For about 40% of the galaxies we could determine a spectroscopic redshift, mainly through the detection of a single emission line that we interpret as Lyα emission
    * we assemble a sample of ≃ 260 galaxies that we use to explore the evolution of the Lyα fraction in Lyman break galaxies and the change in the shape of the emission line between z ∼ 6 and z ∼ 7. 


#### [Extreme jet bending on kiloparsec scales : the 'doughnut' in NGC 6109](https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.01967)
    * We find the radio morphology of the counter-jet to be highly distorted, showing a unique ‘doughnut’ structure ∼6 kpc in diameter.
    * The doughnut is overpressured compared with the surrounding atmosphere as measured with Chandra.
    * A light jet being deflected by gas flows and winds just outside the transition between the galaxy and cluster atmospheres appears to be a more plausible interpretation.


#### [Steep Hard-X-ray Spectra Indicate Extremely High Accretion Rates in Weak Emission-Line Quasars](https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.01306)
    * WLQs have steeper X-ray spectra, suggesting higher accretion rates with respect to “typical” quasars.
    * Collectively, the four radio-intermediate WLQs have lower photon indices with respect to the six radio-quiet WLQs, as may be expected if the spectra of the first group are contaminated by X-ray emission from a jet.
    * We detect soft excess emission in our lowest-redshift radio-quiet WLQ, in agreement with previous findings suggesting that the prominence of this feature is associated with a high accretion rate.

## August 7:

#### [Mid-Infrared Spectroscopic Evidence for AGN Heating Warm Molecular Gas](https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.02035)
    * We use four MIR diagnostics to estimate the contribution of the AGN to the total MIR emission. 
    * We compare the relative strengths of PAH emission features and find that PAH grains in AGN-dominated sources have a wider range of sizes and fractional ionizations than PAH grains in non-AGN dominated sources.
    * We find an average 200 K difference between the excitation temperatures of the H2S(5) and H2S(7) pure rotational molecular hydrogen transition pair in AGN-dominated versus non-AGN dominated galaxies.


#### [A GBT Survey of the HALOGAS Galaxies and Their Environments I: Revealing the full extent of HI around NGC891, NGC925, NGC4414 & NGC4565](https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.02041)
    * The Hi mass fraction below Hi column densities of 10^19 cm−2 is, on average, 2%.
    * The absence of a considerable amount of newly detected Hi by the GBT indicates these galaxies do not have significant extended diffuse Hi structures


#### [Shocks or Photoionization: Direct Temperature Measurements of the Low-Ionization Gas in Quiescent Galaxies](https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.02041)
    - **Interesting**

    * temperature-sensitive [O iii] λ4363, [N ii] λ5755, [Sii]λλ4068,4076,and[Oii]λλ7320,7330 lines
    * The [Sii] doublet ratios indicate the line-emitting gas is in the low density regime
    * We found that the extinction corrections derived from Balmer decrements would yield unphysical re- lationships between the temperatures of the S+ zones and O+ zones, indicating that the extinction is significantly overestimated by the measured Balmer decrements
    * We compared these line ratios with model predictions for three ionization mechanisms: photoionization by hot evolved stars, shocks, and turbulent mixing layers. --> 但是三个都不行


#### [The z=0.54 LoBAL Quasar SDSS J085053.12+445122.5: I. Spectral Synthesis Analysis Reveals a Massive Outflow](https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.02441)
    * We introduce SimBAL, a novel spectral-synthesis procedure that uses large grids of ionic column densities generated by the photoionization code Cloudy and a Bayesian model calibration to forward-model broad absorption line quasar spectra.

    * Deep 1–4 GHz VLA observations of CIZA J2242.8+5301 (z = 0.1921), a double radio relic cluster characterized by small projection on the plane of the sky.
    * We discover new faint diffuse radio emission extending north of the main northern relic.
    * High-resolution mapping of other tailed radio galaxies also supports a scenario where AGN fossil electrons are revived by the merger event and could be related to the formation of some diffuse cluster radio emission.


#### [Correlations between the Dark Matter and Baryonic Properties of CLASH Galaxy Clusters](https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.02136)
    - **Relevant**
    * The total density profiles derived from lensing are interpreted based on the two-phase scenario of cluster formation. In this context, the brightest cluster galaxy (BCG) forms in the first dissipative phase, followed by a dissipationless phase where baryonic physics flattens the inner DM distribution.
    * The inner slope of the DM density for the CLASH clusters is found to be flatter than the Navarro–Frenk–White profile, ranging from α = 0.30 to 0.79. --> 受重子物质过程的影响
    * We examine correlations of the DM density slope α with the effective radius Re and stellar mass Me of the BCG, finding that these quantities are anti-correlated
    * We also study the correlation between Re and the cluster halo mass M500, and the correlation between the total masses inside 5kpc and 100 kpc. We find that these quantities are correlated with Spearman coefficients of 0.68 and 0.64

## August 8:

#### [Connecting Young Star Clusters to CO Molecular Gas in NGC 7793 with ALMA-LEGUS](https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.02496)
    * We find a strong spatial correlation between young star clusters and GMCs such that all clusters still associated with a GMC are younger than 11 Myr and display a median age of 2 Myr.
    * The age distribution increases gradually as the cluster–GMC distance increases, with star clusters that are spatially unassociated with molecular gas exhibiting a median age of 7 Myr.
    * Star clusters are significantly more clustered than the molecular cloud hierarchy 


#### [Angular Momentum and Galaxy Formation Revisited: Scaling Relations for Disks and Bulges](https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.02525)
    - **Interesting**
    * We show that the stellar specific angular momentum j⋆, mass M⋆, and bulge fraction β⋆ of normal galaxies of all morphological types are consistent with a simple model based on a linear superposition of independent disks and bulges.
    * This model correctly predicts that galaxies follow a curved 2D surface in the 3D space of logj⋆, logM⋆, and β⋆


#### [Investigation of the orientation of galaxies in clusters: the importance, methods and results of research](https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.02573)
    - **Relevant**
    * Now, the method allowed analysis both position angles of galaxy major axes and two angles describing the spatial orientation of galaxies
    * We have found that the orientations of galaxies in analyzed clusters are not random. It means that we genuinely confirmed an existence of the alignment of galaxies in rich Abells’ galaxy clusters.


#### [A Deep Lyα Survey in ECDF-S and COSMOS: I. General Properties of Lyman-alpha Emitters at z∼2](https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.02704)
    * The narrowband surveys conducted at Magellan II telescope allow us to obtain a sample of 452 LAEs reaching a 5σ limiting magnitude of ∼ 26 mag
    * There are six LAEs detected by the Spitzer/MIPS 24μm or even Herschel far-infrared observations. 
    * LAE覆盖的质量和SFR范围都很大
    * they are mostly low-mass star-forming galaxies and follow the star formation main sequence relations or their extrapolations to the low-mass end, implying a normal star-forming nature of LAEs.


#### [A star-forming dwarf galaxy candidate in the halo of NGC 4634](https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.02801)
    * We investigate the nature and origin of a star-forming dwarf galaxy candidate located in the halo of the edge-on Virgo galaxy NGC 4634 with a projected distance of 1.4 kpc
    * The high oxygen abundance (12 + log(O/H) ≈ 8.72) of the dwarf galaxy candidate leads to the conclusion that it was formed from pre-enriched material. 


#### [The `Cosmic Seagull': a highly magnified disk-like galaxy at z~2.8 behind the Bullet Cluster](https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.02828)
    * Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array measurements of the ‘Cosmic Seagull’, a strongly magnified galaxy at 𝑧 = 2.7779 behind the Bullet Cluster.

    * 超级好的HI数据：The data reveal many small-scale anomalous velocity features highlighting the complexity of the interacting M81 triplet.
    * This comparison provides evidence for the presence of a substantial reservoir of low-column density gas in the northern part of the triplet, probably associated with M82. Such a reservoir is not found in the southern part.
    * We report a number of newly discovered kpc-sized low-mass H i clouds with H i masses of a few times 10^6 M⊙. 都和Tidal feature有关


#### [Bayesian photometric redshifts of blended sources](https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.02846)
    - **Relevant**
    * We present a Bayesian photometric redshift method for blended sources with an arbitrary number of intrinsic components.
    * Using Bayesian model comparison, we infer the probability that a source is blended and the number of components that it contains. We make available blendz, a Python implementation of our method. 


#### [AGN feedback in the Phoenix cluster](https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.02872)
    * XMM/RGS观测，研究发射X-ray的“冷”气体：We detect for the first time evidence of O VIII and FeXXI-XXII emission lines, the latter demonstrating the presence of gas below 2 keV.
    * Cooling rate below 2 keV是350 Msun/yr；和SFR近似
    * This cooling rate is high enough to produce the molecular gas found in the filaments via instabilities during the buoyant rising time.
    * The line broadening indicates that the turbulence (∼ 300 km s−1 or less) is below the level required to produce and propagate the heat throughout the cool core.

## August 9:

#### [Standoff Distance of Bow Shocks in Galaxy Clusters as Proxy for Mach Number](https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.02885)
    * One of the pure geometrical proxies to the shock Mach number is the standoff distance, i.e. the distance between the leading edge of the shock and the contact discontinuity. 即便仪器分辨率不够，也可以用来估计subcluster并合的速度
    * a combination of the standoff distance with measurements of the Mach number from density/temperature jumps can differentiate between the pre- and post-merger stages, at least when the merger axis is close to the plane of sky or if the merger axis angle to the line of sight can be inferred. 


#### [Nitrogen-to-Oxygen Abundance Ratio Variation In Quiescent Galaxies](https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.02891)
    - **Important**
    * We establish a gas phase abundance pattern calibration for quiescent galaxies using optical emission lines.
    * We show that the relative trend in N/O abun- dance can still be reliably measured based on [N ii] λλ6548,6583/[O ii] λλ3726,3729 and a direct measurement of the electron temperature.
    * Combining [O ii] λλ3726,3729/[O ii] λ7320,7330 and [S ii] λλ6716,6731/[S ii] λ4068,4076
    * We establish the calibration for N/O based on [N ii]/[O ii] and a temperature tracer.


#### [The Evolution of Assembly Bias](https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.02896)
    - **Relevant**
    * Dark matter only simulation: We investigate how the clustering of haloes and their galaxy content depend on halo formation time and concentration, and how these relationships evolve with redshift. 
    * we look at the evolution of assembly bias reflected in the galaxy distribution by examining the galaxy correlation functions relative to those of shuffled galaxy samples which remove the occupancy variation. This correlation functions ratio monotonically decreases with larger redshift and for lower number density samples, going below unity in some cases, leading to reduced galaxy clustering. 


#### [Intense CIII 1907,1909 emission from a strong Lyman continuum emitting galaxy](https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.03059)

    * Combining our measurements and earlier determinations from the literature, we find a trend of increasing ξ0 ion
with increasing C iii] λ1909 equivalent width, which can be understood by a combination of decreasing stellar population age and metallicity.

    * The mid-IR excess and control samples differ strongly in [OIII] line luminosity, ionized gas excitation mechanism, ionization state and electron density.
    * radio-detected, mid-IR excess AGN constitute the most luminous and highly ionized AGN in the local Universe and they contribute primarily to the growth of black holes in the most massive galaxies.

#### [COSMOS-DASH: The Evolution of the Galaxy Size-Mass Relation Since z~3 from new Wide Field WFC3 Imaging Combined with CANDELS/3DHST](https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.04379)
    - **Important, Relevant**
    * COSMOS-DASH is the widest HST/WFC3 imaging survey in H160 filter, tripling the extragalactic survey area in the near-infrared at HST resolution.
    * We find no statistical difference between the median sizes of the most massive star-forming and quiescent galaxies at ⟨z⟩ = 2.5
    * However, we do find a significant difference in the Sersic index between the two samples, such that massive quiescent galaxies have higher central densities than star forming galaxies. 


#### [A SALT Spectral Study of S0s Hosting Pseudobulges](https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.04491)
    * The central spectra of galaxies without bars in our sample reveal a complex star formation history, which is consistent with the belief that pseudobulges have a history of star formation distributed over extended periods of time.


#### [Alma Twenty-six Arcmin^2 Survey Of Goods-s At One-millimeter (asagao): Source Catalog And Number Counts](https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.04502)
    * Array (ALMA) twenty-six arcmin2 survey of GOODS-S at one-millimeter (ASAGAO).
    * We create infrared (IR) luminosity functions (LFs) in the redshift range of z = 1–3 from the ASAGAO sources with KS -band counterparts, and constrain the faintest luminosity of the LF at 2.0 < z < 3.0. The LFs are con- sistent with previous results based on other ALMA and SCUBA-2 observations, which suggest a positive luminosity evolution and negative density evolution with increasing redshift.


#### [Internal Kinematics of UM 461 and CTS 1020](https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.04508)
    * We found that the motion in both star-forming knots of UM 461 has different patterns, suggesting a weak kinematical connection between the knots. 
    * We found that UM 461 seems to be more susceptible to stellar feedback, whereas in CTS 1020 the gravitational potential dominates.


#### [AKARI mid-infrared slitless spectroscopic survey of star-forming galaxies at z≲0.5](https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.04566)
    * We conducted a low-resolution (R ≃ 50) slitless spectroscopic survey at 5–13 μm of 9 μm flux- selected sources (> 0.3 mJy) around the North Ecliptic Pole with the Infrared Camera (IRC) onboard AKARI.
    * The rest-frame SEDs of all PAH galaxies have a universal shape with stellar and 7.7 μm bumps, except that the PAH enhancement significantly varies as a function of the PAH luminosities.
    * We identified a PAH-enhanced population at z   0.35, whose SEDs and luminosities are typical of luminous infrared galaxies. They show particularly larger PAH enhancement at high luminosity,


#### [Ubiquitous ram pressure stripping in the Coma cluster of galaxies](https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.04575)
    - **Relevant**
    * 在Coma里找到了三个RPS的例子，之前Russell Smith发现过：We therefore devoted one full night of Hα observation to each of the three galaxies using the San Pedro Martir 2.1m telescope. One-sided tails of Hα emission of 10-20 kpc projected size were detected, suggesting an ongoing ram pressure stripping event.
    * This brings the number sources with Hα trails to 17 gaseous tails out of 27 (63 %) late-type galaxies (LTG) galaxies members of the Coma cluster with direct evidence of ram pressure stripping.


#### [The XXL Survey: XXXIII. Chandra Constraints on the AGN Contamination of z > 1 XXL Galaxy Clusters](https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.04623)
    * With the superior angular resolution of Chandra we investigate whether there are any point sources within the cluster region that were not detected by the XMM-XXL analysis pipeline, and whether any point sources were misclassified as distant clusters.
    * Of the 14 clusters: Of the other five sources, one is significantly contaminated by previously unresolved AGN, and four appear to be AGN misclassified as clusters.


#### [The Active Assembly of the Virgo Cluster: Indications for Recent Group Infall From Early-Type Dwarf Galaxies](https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.04751)
    - **Relevant**
    * we find an intriguing behavior of early types with magnitudes −17 ≥ Mr ≥ −18. They show a large velocity spread and an asymmetric phase-space distribution, similar to the late-type galaxies and different from the early types just one magnitude brighter/fainter.
    * close phase-space aggregation of early-type dwarfs at large clustercentric distance and high relative velocity: 相空间上有聚集，但物理空间里看不到聚集，很可能是infalling group的证据
    * Nearly all of them show signatures of disk components and their colors imply stellar ages that are younger than the population average. They are not located closely together but spread azimuthally around the cluster center. We show that this is expected from simulations of an infalling galaxy group that slowly gets dispersed af- ter its first pericentric passage


#### [The orientation of galaxy pairs with filamentary structures: dependence on morphology](https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.04762)
    * With the aim of performing an analysis of the orientations of galaxy pair systems with respect to the underlying large-scale structure, we study the alignment between the axis connecting the pair galaxies and the host cosmic filament where the pair resides.
    * We find a statistically significant alignment signal between the pair axes and the spine of the host filaments consistent with a relative excess of ∼ 15% aligned pairs. We obtain that pairs composed by elliptical galaxies exhibit a stronger alignment, showing a higher alignment signal for pairs closer than 200 h−1 kpc to the filament spine.


#### [Quantifying the Diffuse Continuum Contribution of BLR Clouds to AGN Continuum Inter-band Delays](https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.04798)

    * 可能有一部分delay信号来自diffuse continuum emission: Qualitatively, the diffuse continuum delay signatures produced by our models resemble that observed for NGC 5548, including the deviation of the lag spectrum above that of a simple power-law in wavelength

#### [Studying the [OIII]λ5007A emission-line width in a sample of ∼80 local active galaxies: A surrogate for σ⋆?](https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.04821)
    * Fitting the [OIII] line with a single Gaussian or Gauss-Hermite polynomials overestimates σ⋆ by 50-100%.
    * When line asymmetries from non-gravitational gas motion are excluded in a double Gaussian fit, the average ratio between the core [OIII] width (σ[OIII],D) and σ⋆ is ∼1, but with individual data points off by up to a factor of two.
    * However, a direct comparison between σ⋆ and σ[OIII],D shows no close correlation, only that both quantities have the same range, average and standard deviation, probably because they feel the same gravitational potential.


#### [Constraints on the Cosmic-Ray Ionization Rate in the z∼2.3 Lensed Galaxies SMM J2135−0102 and SDP 17b from Observations of OH+ and H2O](https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.04852)
    * Abundances of OH+ and H2O+ are useful for inferring ζH cosmic ray ionization rate when combined with chemical models: 宇宙线在超新星遗迹里加速，所以电离rate应该和SFR相关
    * The observed OH+ and H2O+ absorption is thought to arise in massive, extended halos of cool, diffuse gas that surround these galaxies.
    * As our estimates come from gas that is far away from the sites of cosmic-ray acceleration, they imply that cosmic-ray ionization rates in the compact regions where star formation occurs in these galaxies are orders of magnitude higher.

#### [Properties and redshift evolution of star-forming galaxies with high [OIII]/[OII] ratios withot MUSE at 0.28<z<0.85](https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.04889)
    * Recently discovered Lyman continuum (LyC) emitters have extremely high oxygen line ratios: [O iii]λ5007/[O ii]λλ3726, 3729> 4.
    * Out of this sample 15 are identified as extreme oxygen emitters based on their [O iii]/[O ii] ratios (3.7%) and 104 galaxies have [O iii]/[O ii] > 1 (26%). 
    * We find a decrease in the fraction of galaxies with [O iii]/[O ii] > 1 with increasing M∗ , however, this is most likely a result of the relationship between [O iii]/[O ii] and metallicity, rather than between [Oiii]/[Oii] and M∗.

#### [The MUSE Hubble Ultra Deep Field Survey XI. Constraining the low-mass end of the stellar mass - star formation rate relation at z<1](https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.04900)
    - **Useful**
    * 关于SF“主序”： A turnover in the sequence has been observed, where galaxies with M∗ < 10^10 M⊙ follow a steeper relation than their higher mass counterparts, suggesting that the low-mass slope is (nearly) linear.
    * We find a sub-linear slope for the low-mass regime, increasing with redshift. We recover an intrinsic scatter in the relation, larger than typically found at higher masses.
    * As both hydrodynamical simulations and (semi-)analytical models typically favour a steeper slope in the low-mass regime, our results provide new constraints on the feedback processes which operate preferentially in low-mass halos.

#### [CPz: Classification-aided photometric-redshift estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.04977)
    * We present a novel automatic method of optimizing photometric redshift performance, the classification-aided photometric redshift estimation (CPz). The main feature of CPz is the unified treatment of all classes of objects detected in extragalactic surveys: galaxies of any type (passive, starforming and starbursts), active galactic nuclei (AGN), quasi-stellar objects (QSO), stars and also includes the identification of potential photometric redshift catastrophic outliers.


#### [Dissecting the AGN disk-jet system with joint VLBI-Gaia analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.05115)
    * We analyze differences in positions of active galactic nuclei between Gaia data release 2 and VLBI and compare the significant VLBI-to-Gaia offsets in more than 1000 objects with their jet directions. At least 3/4 of the significant offsets are confirmed to occur downstream or upstream the jet representing a genuine astrophysical effect.
    * The observed behaviour of the different AGN classes is consistent with the unified scheme assuming varying contribution of the obscuring dusty torus and jet beaming.


#### [Dramatic X-ray spectral variability of a Compton-thick type-1 QSO at z∼1](https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.05207)
    * The XMM-Newton spectrum from the year 2000 is characterized by an unobscured power-law spectrum with photon index of Γ ∼ 2, a column density of NH ∼ 5×10^20 cm−2, and no prominent reflection component. Five years later, Chandra captured the source in a heavily-obscured, reflection-dominated state.
    * Dramatic X-ray spectral variability of this kind could be quite common in type-1 QSOs, considering the relatively few datasets in which such an event could have been identified.
    

#### [The evolution of the UV-to-mm extragalactic background light: evidence for a top-heavy initial mass function?](https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.05208)
    - **Interesting**
    * 用SAM预测EBL：The predicted EBL is in near- perfect agreement with recent observations over the whole UV-to-mm spectrum, as is the evolution of the cosmic spectral energy distribution over the redshift range for which observations are available (z < 1).
    * We assess whether one of the more controversial aspects of our model, a top-heavy initial mass function (IMF) for galaxies undergoing dynamically-triggered bursts of star formation, is necessary in order to reproduce the EBL, and find that variant models with a universal solar-neighborhood IMF cannot produce as good agree- ment with EBL observations over the whole UV-to-mm spectrum.


#### [The STRong lensing Insights into the Dark Energy Survey (STRIDES) 2016 follow-up campaign. I. Overview and classification of candidates selected by two techniques](https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.04838)
    * We continue by detailing the results of two selection methods, the Outlier Selection Technique and a morphological algorithm, and presenting lens models of a system which could possibly be a lensed quasar in an unusual configuration.
    * STRIDES followed up 117 targets identifying 7 new strongly lensed systems, and 7 nearly identical quasars (NIQs), which could be confirmed as lenses by the detection of the lens galaxy.


#### [Possible ~ 1 hour quasi-periodic oscillation in narrow-line Seyfert 1 galaxy MCG--06--30--15](https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.05112)

#### [Galaxy Ellipticity Measurements in the Near-Infrared for Weak Lensing](https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.05223)
    * The co-added CANDELS/HST V+I and J+H images are degraded in resolution and sensitivity to simulate Euclid-quality optical and near-infrared (NIR) images.
    * At z > 1.0, the NIR-selected source density is higher by a factor 1.4 and therefore the scatter in NIR-derived ellipticities is about 30% smaller, implying a more precise ellipticity measurement.

    * We also compare and match the hot gas density and temperature profiles for the most massive halo in our model to those observed recently for redshifts upto 2


#### [Swift Monitoring Observations of Mrk 231: Detection of Ultraviolet Variability](https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.05235)
    * We analyze 168 Swift monitoring observations of the nearest broad absorption line quasar Mrk 231 in the UV and X-ray bands, where we detect significant variability in the UV (∼2246 ̊A) light curve
    * The UV variability and its power spectrum suggest that a significant amount of the UV emission of Mrk 231 is from the accretion disk. 


#### [The Evolution of the HeII-Ionizing Background at Redshifts 2.3<z<3.8 Inferred from a Statistical Sample of 24 HST/COS HeII Lyα Absorption Spectra](https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.05247)
    * new measurements of the large-scale (≈ 40 comoving Mpc) effective optical depth of He II Lyα absorption, τeff, at 2.54 < z < 3.86 toward 16 He II-transparent quasars
    * We confirm that the median τeff increases from ≃ 2 at z = 2.7 to a limit τeff   5 at z > 3, and that the scatter in τeff increases with redshift.
    * At z > 3.5 we observe predominantly saturated He II absorption, but several isolated narrow (∆v < 650 km s−1) transmission spikes indicate patches of fully reionized helium at these early epochs.
    * At z > 2.74 the variance in the observed τeff significantly exceeds expectations for a spatially uniform He II-ionizing background, but is in good agreement with a fluctuating radiation field that is due to stochasticity in the quasar number density and spatial variations of the mean free path to He II-ionizing photons in the post-reionization IGM


#### [The COS CGM Compendium (CCC). I: Survey Design and Initial Results](https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.05252)
    * Present a neutral hydrogen-selected absorption-line survey of gas with H I column densities 15 < log NH I < 19 at z < 1 using the Cosmic Origins Spectrograph, 研究吸收体的金属丰度分布
    * We find singly and doubly ionized metal species and H I typically have similar velocity profiles, implying they probe gas in the same or similar environments.
    * the gas in these absorbers is largely ionized, and the ionization conditions are quite comparable across the sampled NH I range.
    * The Mg II column densities span > 2 orders of magnitude at any given NH I, indicating a wide range of metallicities (from solar to < 1/100 solar)
    * Less than 3% of the absorbers in our sample show no detectable metal absorption, implying truly-pristine gas at z <1 is uncommon.


#### [[OII] as a proxy for star formation in AGN host galaxies: beware of extended emission line regions](https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.05421)
    * Here, we identify EELRs by the presence of the [Ne v] 3426 ̊A emission line, which, like [O ii], is not strongly excited in the inner regions of AGN, but is a prominent emission line in the lower density EELRs.
    * Critically, unlike [O ii], [Ne v] is not excited by star formation. Therefore, when strong [Nev] is present in an AGN spectrum, the flux from the EELR is not negligible, implying the [O ii] flux is contaminated by emission from the EELR


#### [The impact of bars and interactions on optically selected AGNs in spiral galaxies](https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.05536)
    * We found that barred optically selected AGNs show an excess of nuclear activity (as derived from the Lum[OIII]) and accretion rate onto a central black hole (R) with respect to AGNs in pairs
    * We also found that the fractions of AGNs with powerful nuclear activity and high accretion rates increase toward more massive hosts with bluer colors and younger stellar populations

    * 65 far ultraviolet quasar spectra (resolution R ∼ 18, 000)  
    * From the P (k) measurements, we estimate the H I photoionization rate (ΓHI) in the z < 0.5 intergalactic medium. Our results confirm most of the previous ΓHI estimates based on the H I Lyman-α line-fitting and low-z measurements of P (k).
