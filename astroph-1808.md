#### [Precision Pollution - The effects of enrichment yields and timing on galactic chemical evolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.00007)
    * Attribution of the galaxy-scale abundance patterns to individual enrichment mechanisms such as the winds from asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars or the presence of a prompt fraction of Type Ia supernovae is complicated by the interaction between them and gas cooling, subsequent star formation and gas ejection.
    * Delay time distribution: DTD; We find DTDs with a large prompt fraction (such as the bimodal and power-law models) have, at z = 0, similar abundance patterns compared to the low-prompt component time distributions (uniform or wide Gaussian models).
    * 但是两个情形的 [X/Fe] ratio和铁丰度演化不同


#### [Uncorrelated velocity and size residuals across galaxy rotation curves](https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.00271)
    - **Relevant, Interesting**
    * We study the coupling of the Tully–Fisher and mass–size relations both in observations (the SPARC sample) and in empirical galaxy formation models based on halo abundance matching.
    * 看TF关系和mass-size relation的residuls之间在不同半径上的相关:We find no significant correlation in either the data or models for any r. 
    * We do however find evidence for an anticorrelation of galaxy size with halo concentration at fixed baryonic mass


#### [Analyzing interferometric observations of strong gravitational lenses with recurrent and convolutional neural networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.00011)
    - **Useful, Interesting**
    * training a feed-forward CNN on dirty images, and find that neural networks can simultaneously adapt to dirty images generated from vastly different uv-coverages.
    * we use the recurrent inference machine (RIM) introduced in Putzky & Welling (2017). This provides a fast and automated alternative to the traditional CLEAN algorithm.
