#### [Precision Pollution - The effects of enrichment yields and timing on galactic chemical evolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.00007)
    * Attribution of the galaxy-scale abundance patterns to individual enrichment mechanisms such as the winds from asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars or the presence of a prompt fraction of Type Ia supernovae is complicated by the interaction between them and gas cooling, subsequent star formation and gas ejection.
    * Delay time distribution: DTD; We find DTDs with a large prompt fraction (such as the bimodal and power-law models) have, at z = 0, similar abundance patterns compared to the low-prompt component time distributions (uniform or wide Gaussian models).
    * 但是两个情形的 [X/Fe] ratio和铁丰度演化不同


#### [Uncorrelated velocity and size residuals across galaxy rotation curves](https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.00271)
    - **Relevant, Interesting**
    * We study the coupling of the Tully–Fisher and mass–size relations both in observations (the SPARC sample) and in empirical galaxy formation models based on halo abundance matching.
    * 看TF关系和mass-size relation的residuls之间在不同半径上的相关:We find no significant correlation in either the data or models for any r. 
    * We do however find evidence for an anticorrelation of galaxy size with halo concentration at fixed baryonic mass


#### [Analyzing interferometric observations of strong gravitational lenses with recurrent and convolutional neural networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.00011)
    - **Useful, Interesting**
    * training a feed-forward CNN on dirty images, and find that neural networks can simultaneously adapt to dirty images generated from vastly different uv-coverages.
    * we use the recurrent inference machine (RIM) introduced in Putzky & Welling (2017). This provides a fast and automated alternative to the traditional CLEAN algorithm.

#### [Stellar Radiation is Critical for Regulating Star Formation and Driving Outflows in Low Mass Dwarf Galaxies](https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.00468)
    * However, it has been recently suggested that pre-SN feedback, from either stellar winds or stellar radiation, is necessary in high-resolution simulations of galaxy evolution to properly regulate star formation and properties of the interstellar medium (ISM).
    * 一般模拟只是说让新生恒星周围的dense分子云被摧毁
    * we use high resolution simulations (1.8 pc) of an isolated dwarf galaxy with detailed stellar feedback tracked on a star-by-star basis.
    * We find that including ionizing radiation reduces the star formation rate by over a factor of 5, and is necessary in creating the ISM conditions needed for supernovae to drive significant outflows.


#### [A Galaxy-Scale Fountain of Cold Molecular Gas Pumped by a Black Hole](https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.00473)
    - **Interesting, Relevant**
    * A2597中间超大质量分子云filament的ALMA+MUSE观测
    * Its warm ionized and cold molecular components are both cospatial and comoving, consistent with the hypothesis that the optical nebula traces the warm envelopes of many cold molecular clouds
    * The clouds are not in dynamical equilibrium, and instead show evidence for inflow toward the central supermassive black hole, outflow along the jets it launches, and uplift by the buoyant hot bubbles those jets inflate.
    * a galaxy-spanning “fountain”, wherein cold gas clouds drain into the black hole accretion reservoir, powering jets and bubbles that uplift a cooling plume of low-entropy multiphase gas, which may stimulate additional cooling and accretion as part of a self-regulating feedback loop


#### [The Massively Accreting Cluster A2029](https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.00488)
    - **Relevant**
    * The complete redshift survey of A2029 also identifies at least 12 foreground and background systems (10 are extended X-ray sources)
    * 附近有A2033和Southern Infalling Group两个主要substructure，质量都不小
    * Simple dynamical considerations suggest that A2029 will accrete these subsystems in next few Gyr.


#### [OMEGA - OSIRIS Mapping of Emission-line Galaxies in A901/2: IV. - Extinction of Star-Formation Estimators with Inclination](https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.00530)
    * study the effect of inclination on the apparent brightness of star-forming galaxies in spectral passbands that are commonly used as star-formation indicators
    * 使用了tunable-filter imaging 
    * we find trends in the UV and Hα mass-to-light ratio that suggest an inclination-induced attenuation from face-on to edge-on of ∼ 1 mag and ∼ 0.7 mag in UV and Hα, respectively, implying that star-formation rates of edge-on galaxies would be underestimated by ∼ 2.5× in UV and ∼ 2× in Hα.

#### [Galaxy Structure in the Ultraviolet: The Dependence of Morphological Parameters on Rest-Frame Wavelength](https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.00577)
    * We find a relationship between the CAS parameters and observed rest-frame wavelength that make galaxies appear more late-type at shorter wavelengths, particularly in the UV
    * The effect is strongest for E/S0 galaxies in the far-UV, which have concentrations and asymmetries that more resemble those of spiral and peculiar/merging galaxies in the optical.

#### [Supermassive black holes with high accretion rates in active galactic nuclei. VII. Reconstruction of velocity-delay maps by maximum entropy method](https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.00705)
    * we apply the maximum entropy method (MEM) to 9 narrow-line Seyfert 1 galaxies with super-Eddington accretion rates observed during 2012-2013 for the velocity-delay maps of their Hβ and Hγ emission lines.
    * These super-Eddington accretors show diverse geometry and kinematics.

## August 5:

#### [The QUEST-La Silla AGN variability survey: connection between AGN variability and black hole physical properties](https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.00967)
    * We found that the amplitude of the variability (A) depends solely on the rest frame emission wavelength and the Eddington ratio, where A anti-correlates with both λrest and L/LEdd.
        - Its amplitude is inversely related to the accretion rate.
    * For 20.6% of the variable sources in our sample, a DRW model is not appropriate to describe the variability


#### [Stellar Feedback and the Energy Budget of Late-Type Galaxies: Missing Baryons and Core Creation](https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.00971)
    * By fitting halo profiles to the rotation curves of galaxies in the SPARC data set, we measure the “missing baryon” mass for individual late-type systems.
    * we show that the maximum energy available from supernovae is typically not enough to completely eject these “missing baryons” from a halo, but it is often sufficient to heat them to the virial temperature.
    * the energy available from supernova feedback is always enough to convert a primordial cusp into a core and has magnitude consistent with what is required to heat the “missing baryons” to the virial temperature.

#### [Witnessing galaxy assembly at the edge of the reionization epoch](https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.01146)
    * Serenity-18, a galaxy at z ≃ 5.939 for which we could measure the content of molecular gas; 还有 gas clump/filament which is possibly feeding its growth
    * The metal poor gas is detected through a damped Lyman-α absorber observed at a spatial separation of 40 kpc and at the same redshift


#### [Low-luminosity AGN and X-ray binary populations in COSMOS star-forming galaxies](https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.00970)
    * X-ray stacking analysis of ∼75,000 star-forming galaxies between 0.1 < z < 5.0 using the Chandra COSMOS Legacy survey to study the X-ray emission of low-luminosity active galactic nuclei (AGN)
    * Comparing the measured luminosities to established XRB scaling relations, we find that the redshift evolution of the luminosity per star formation rate (SFR) of XRBs depends sensitively on the assumed obscuration
    * After subtracting the estimated XRB contribution from the stacks, we find that most stacks at z > 1.3 exhibit a significant X-ray excess indicating nuclear emission. The AGN emission is strongly correlated with stellar mass but does not exhibit an additional correlation with SFR.
    * The hardness ratios of the high-redshift stacks indicate that the AGN are substantially obscured

## August 6:

#### [Black Hole - Galaxy Scaling Relationships for Active Galactic Nuclei with Reverberation Masses](https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.01329)
    - **Important**
    * We have separated the host galaxy from the bright central AGN, allowing a re-examination of the MBH − Lbulge and MBH − Lgalaxy relationships and the MBH − Mbulge and MBH − Mstars relationships using V-H color to constrain the stellar mass-to-light ratio. 
    * We also find good agreement with the expectations from the Illustris simulations, although the agreement with other simulations is less clear because of the different black hole mass ranges that are probed.
    * MBH − Lbulge is found to have the least scatter, and is therefore the best predictor of MBH among the relationships examined here.
    * We have examined MBH/Mstars and find a clear trend with black hole mass but not galaxy mass.


#### [On the influence of environment on star forming galaxies](https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.01628)
    * GAEA SAM研究
    * We analyse the origin of differences between physical properties of satellites and those of their central counterparts, identified by matching the Vmax of their host haloes at the accretion time of the satellites.
    * In contrast, our model predicts larger differences with respect to data for the molecular gas mass and star formation rate.
        - that differences in the gas content arise after accretion, and can be entirely ascribed to the instantaneous strip- ping of the hot gas reservoir.
    * We argue that these disagreements could be largely resolved with the inclusion of a proper treatment for ram-pressure stripping of cold gas and a more gradual stripping of the hot gas reservoir. 


#### [ALMA 12CO (J=1--0) imaging of the nearby galaxy M83: Variations in the efficiency of star formation in giant molecular clouds](https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.01702)
    * In the eastern arm, the CO peaks form two arc-shaped ridges that run along the arm and exhibit a distinct difference in the activity of star formation: the one on the leading side has numerous H II regions associated with it, whereas the other one on the trailing side has only a few.


#### [An early-type galaxy with an inner star-forming disk](https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.01730)
    * We report a discovery of an ETG (SDSS J142055.01+400715.7) with M∗=10^10 M⊙ that offers direct evidence for gas-rich merging as the origin of low-mass ETGs.
    * Furthermore, the inner disk harbors on-going star formation, indicating the merging to be gas rich. 


#### [GAMA/G10-COSMOS/3D-HST: Evolution of the galaxy stellar mass function over 12.5Gyrs](https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.01754)
    - **Relevant, Important**
    * Surprisingly, when fitting a two-component Schechter function, we find essentially no evidence of temporal evolution in M⋆, the two α slope parameters, or the normalisation of the low-mass component.
    * Instead, our fits suggest that the various shape parameters have been exceptionally stable over cosmic time, as has the normalisation of the low- mass component, and that the evolution of the stellar-mass function is well described by a simple build up of the high-mass component over time.
    * Finally, we find that the evolution of the stellar-mass function, and the observed stellar mass density, can be well described by a simple model of constant growth in the high-mass source density


#### [Revealing Dusty Supernovae in High-Redshift (Ultra-)Luminous InfraRed Galaxies Through Near-Infrared Integrated Light Variability](https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.01780)
    * 在高红移ULIRGS里找SN: to search for the presence of supernovae through the variability of the integrated restframe infrared light of the entire hosts.
    * We obtain a sample of (U)LIRGs that have secure optical counterparts, and examine their light curves in 3–5 μm in the IRAC Dark Field (IDF), 有14年的数据
    * We present two cases where the distinct features in their light curves are consistent with multiple supernovae overlapping in time.


#### [CANDELSz7: a large spectroscopic survey of CANDELS galaxies in the reionization epoch](https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.01847)
    * results of CANDELSz7, an ESO large program aimed at confirming spectroscopically a homogeneous sample of z≃6 and z≃7 star forming galaxies.
    * FORS2 12-20小时的光谱
    * For about 40% of the galaxies we could determine a spectroscopic redshift, mainly through the detection of a single emission line that we interpret as Lyα emission
    * we assemble a sample of ≃ 260 galaxies that we use to explore the evolution of the Lyα fraction in Lyman break galaxies and the change in the shape of the emission line between z ∼ 6 and z ∼ 7. 


#### [Extreme jet bending on kiloparsec scales : the 'doughnut' in NGC 6109](https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.01967)
    * We find the radio morphology of the counter-jet to be highly distorted, showing a unique ‘doughnut’ structure ∼6 kpc in diameter.
    * The doughnut is overpressured compared with the surrounding atmosphere as measured with Chandra.
    * A light jet being deflected by gas flows and winds just outside the transition between the galaxy and cluster atmospheres appears to be a more plausible interpretation.


#### [Steep Hard-X-ray Spectra Indicate Extremely High Accretion Rates in Weak Emission-Line Quasars](https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.01306)
    * WLQs have steeper X-ray spectra, suggesting higher accretion rates with respect to “typical” quasars.
    * Collectively, the four radio-intermediate WLQs have lower photon indices with respect to the six radio-quiet WLQs, as may be expected if the spectra of the first group are contaminated by X-ray emission from a jet.
    * We detect soft excess emission in our lowest-redshift radio-quiet WLQ, in agreement with previous findings suggesting that the prominence of this feature is associated with a high accretion rate.
