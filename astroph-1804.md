#### [Exploring the CO/CN line ratio in nearby galaxies with the ALMA archive](https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.11225)
    * CN is an interesting molecule that traces dense gas exposed to ultraviolet radiation and its N = 1−0 lines can be observed simultaneously with the CO J = 1−0 line.
    * These line ratio changes are likely due to changes in the [CN]/[H2] abundance ratio and/or the CN excitation
    * 3 of the 4 active galactic nuclei in our sample show CO/CN line ratios that are roughly a factor of 2-3 larger than those seen in starburst-dominated regions


#### [On the connectivity of the cosmic web: theory and implications for cosmology and galaxy formation](https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.11477)
    * Cosmic connectivity and multiplicity, i.e. the number of filaments globally or locally connected to a given cluster is a natural probe of the growth of structure and in particular of the nature of dark energy.
    * As an illustration, this connectivity is quantified in galaxy lensing convergence maps and large dark haloes catalogues. 


#### [Broadband X-ray Spectral Analysis of the Double-Nucleus Luminous Infrared Galaxy Mrk 4763](https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.11223)
    * E: Intrinsic SED is X-ray weak relative to the UV luminosity;  We suggest that the merger triggered a rapid growth of the black hole in Mrk 463E
    * W: Eddington ratio is low (< 10−3) and it might be still in an early phase of merger-driven AGN activity.

#### [Modeling Nearly Spherical Pure-Bulge Galaxies with Stellar Mass-to-Light Ratio Gradient under ΛCDM and MOND Paradigms: I. Methodology, Dynamical Stellar Mass and Fundamental Mass Plane](https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.00040)
    - **Relevant**
    * Our analysis allows for gradients in the stellar mass- to-light ratio (M⋆/L) and uses a generalized Osipkov-Merritt model for the VD anisotropy. 
    *  We then present the projected dynamical stellar mass, M⋆e, within the effective radius Re, and the fundamental mass plane as a function of gradient strength K
    * The fundamental mass plane derived for the nearly round pure-bulge galaxies has coefficients consistent with the virial expectation and only the zero point scales with K.


#### [Spectroscopic Constraints on UV Metal Line Emission at z~6-9: The Nature of Lyman-alpha Emitting Galaxies in the Reionization-Era](https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.00041)
    * However in the zLyα = 8.683 galaxy EGSY8p7, we detect a 4.6σ emission line in the narrow spectral window expected for NVλ1243.
    * With this new detection, five of thirteen known Lyα emitters at z > 7 have now been shown to have intense UV line emission, suggesting that extreme radiation fields are commonplace among the Lyα population


#### [Survey of Water and Ammonia in Nearby galaxies (SWAN): Resolved Ammonia Thermometry, and Water and Methanol Masers in IC 342, NGC 6946 and NGC 2146](https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.00578)
    * We identify two new water masers in IC 342, and one new water maser in each of NGC 6946 and NGC 2146.
    * The two galaxies NGC 253 and NGC 2146, with the most vigorous star formation, host H2O kilomasers.

    * We find a significant surplus of rings (2.3σ) and lenses (2.9σ) in disk-type galaxies as they transition across the green valley.

    * We measure diagnostic emission line ratios as a function of distance from the nucleus and compare them to models for different excitation mechanisms
    * The physical model that best describes our targets comprises a low-luminosity, accretion- powered active nucleus that photoionizes the gas within ∼20 pc of the galaxy center and shocks that excite the gas at larger distances.


#### [An HI study of the collisional ring galaxy NGC 922](https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.07037)
    * The H I morphology and kinematics of NGC 922 show that this galaxy is not the product of a simple drop-through interaction, but has a more complex interaction history.

    * The best-fitting IMF is deficient in high mass stars compared to a canonical Kroupa IMF

    * THINGS, CALIFA and Romanowsky & Fall datasets: Mass-j relation
    * Pseudo-bulge和classical bulge的normalization不同
    * These results are consistent with the hypothesis that while growth in either bulge type is linked to a decrease in j∗/M∗, the mechanisms that build pseudobulges seem to be less efficient at increasing bulge mass per decrease in specific angular momentum than those that build classical bulges.

    * Here we pay special attention to the star-forming region between the interacting galaxies – a tidal dwarf galaxy (TDG) candidate.
    * TDG is metal poor in comparison to the parental galaxy.
    * Low velocity difference between TDG, NGC 4017 and the gaseous bridge between them evidences that the lifetime of TDG is restricted by the time of its fall back onto the parent galaxy.

    * Han et al. (2017) found that the substructure masses can be significantly underpredicted by SUBFIND and thus be in part responsible for the apparent tension with ΛCDM that is found using subhalo masses alone.

    * for low-luminosity AGNs (LLAGNs), either the intrinsic absorption column density, or the fraction of absorbed AGNs, positively scales with the Eddington ratio
    * they are powered by hot accretion flows surrounding supermassive black holes.

#### [A relation between characteristic stellar age of galaxies and their intrinsic shape](https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.07769)
    - **Important, Relevant** 
    * We find a strong correlation of stellar population age with location in the (V/σ, εe) diagram that links the ratio of ordered ro- tation to random motions in a galaxy to its observed ellipticity.
    * For the large majority of galaxies that are oblate rotating spheroids, we find that characteristic stellar age follows the intrinsic ellipticity of galaxies remarkably well.

    * cosmological magneto-hydrodynamical high-resolution simulations of Milky Way-mass galaxies
    * Auriga haloes are typically too massive.
    * We find a connection between population gradients and mass assembly history: galaxies with few significant progenitors have more massive haloes, possess large negative halo metallicity gradients and steeper density profiles

#### [Effects of NII and Hα Line Blending on the WFIRST Galaxy Redshift Survey](https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.08061)
    * Due to the finite spectroscopic resolution of the WFIRST grism, the Hα line and the neighboring [N ii] lines are not separately resolved, leading to a potential bias in the redshift that depends on the [N ii]/Hα ratio.
    * Using the Buzzard-v1.1 simulation of mock galaxies, we explore the effect of line blending and mass (hence environment)- dependent [Nii]/Hα ratio on redshift-space distortion (RSD) and baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) measurements.
