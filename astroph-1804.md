#### [Exploring the CO/CN line ratio in nearby galaxies with the ALMA archive](https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.11225)
    * CN is an interesting molecule that traces dense gas exposed to ultraviolet radiation and its N = 1−0 lines can be observed simultaneously with the CO J = 1−0 line.
    * These line ratio changes are likely due to changes in the [CN]/[H2] abundance ratio and/or the CN excitation
    * 3 of the 4 active galactic nuclei in our sample show CO/CN line ratios that are roughly a factor of 2-3 larger than those seen in starburst-dominated regions


#### [On the connectivity of the cosmic web: theory and implications for cosmology and galaxy formation](https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.11477)
    * Cosmic connectivity and multiplicity, i.e. the number of filaments globally or locally connected to a given cluster is a natural probe of the growth of structure and in particular of the nature of dark energy.
    * As an illustration, this connectivity is quantified in galaxy lensing convergence maps and large dark haloes catalogues. 


#### [Broadband X-ray Spectral Analysis of the Double-Nucleus Luminous Infrared Galaxy Mrk 4763](https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.11223)
    * E: Intrinsic SED is X-ray weak relative to the UV luminosity;  We suggest that the merger triggered a rapid growth of the black hole in Mrk 463E
    * W: Eddington ratio is low (< 10−3) and it might be still in an early phase of merger-driven AGN activity.

#### [Modeling Nearly Spherical Pure-Bulge Galaxies with Stellar Mass-to-Light Ratio Gradient under ΛCDM and MOND Paradigms: I. Methodology, Dynamical Stellar Mass and Fundamental Mass Plane](https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.00040)
    - **Relevant**
    * Our analysis allows for gradients in the stellar mass- to-light ratio (M⋆/L) and uses a generalized Osipkov-Merritt model for the VD anisotropy. 
    *  We then present the projected dynamical stellar mass, M⋆e, within the effective radius Re, and the fundamental mass plane as a function of gradient strength K
    * The fundamental mass plane derived for the nearly round pure-bulge galaxies has coefficients consistent with the virial expectation and only the zero point scales with K.


#### [Spectroscopic Constraints on UV Metal Line Emission at z~6-9: The Nature of Lyman-alpha Emitting Galaxies in the Reionization-Era](https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.00041)
    * However in the zLyα = 8.683 galaxy EGSY8p7, we detect a 4.6σ emission line in the narrow spectral window expected for NVλ1243.
    * With this new detection, five of thirteen known Lyα emitters at z > 7 have now been shown to have intense UV line emission, suggesting that extreme radiation fields are commonplace among the Lyα population


#### [Survey of Water and Ammonia in Nearby galaxies (SWAN): Resolved Ammonia Thermometry, and Water and Methanol Masers in IC 342, NGC 6946 and NGC 2146](https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.00578)
    * We identify two new water masers in IC 342, and one new water maser in each of NGC 6946 and NGC 2146.
    * The two galaxies NGC 253 and NGC 2146, with the most vigorous star formation, host H2O kilomasers.

    * The cluster shapes and concentrations are consistent with ΛCDM predictions. 
    * The CLASH clusters are randomly oriented, as expected given the sample selection criteria. 
    * Shapes agree with numerical results for DM-only halos, which hints at baryonic physics being not so effective in making halos rounder.

#### [The impact of feedback and the hot halo on the rates of gas accretion onto galaxies](https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.01537)
    * We find that at redshifts z~2 the accretion rate onto the galaxy increases with halo mass in the halo mass range 10^10 − 10^11.7 M⊙, flattens between the halo masses 10^11.7 − 10^12.7 M⊙, and increases again for higher-mass haloes --> 可能是和AGN feedback有关的现象
