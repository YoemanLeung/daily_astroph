#### [Exploring the CO/CN line ratio in nearby galaxies with the ALMA archive](https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.11225)
    * CN is an interesting molecule that traces dense gas exposed to ultraviolet radiation and its N = 1−0 lines can be observed simultaneously with the CO J = 1−0 line.
    * These line ratio changes are likely due to changes in the [CN]/[H2] abundance ratio and/or the CN excitation
    * 3 of the 4 active galactic nuclei in our sample show CO/CN line ratios that are roughly a factor of 2-3 larger than those seen in starburst-dominated regions


#### [On the connectivity of the cosmic web: theory and implications for cosmology and galaxy formation](https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.11477)
    * Cosmic connectivity and multiplicity, i.e. the number of filaments globally or locally connected to a given cluster is a natural probe of the growth of structure and in particular of the nature of dark energy.
    * As an illustration, this connectivity is quantified in galaxy lensing convergence maps and large dark haloes catalogues. 


#### [Broadband X-ray Spectral Analysis of the Double-Nucleus Luminous Infrared Galaxy Mrk 4763](https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.11223)
    * E: Intrinsic SED is X-ray weak relative to the UV luminosity;  We suggest that the merger triggered a rapid growth of the black hole in Mrk 463E
    * W: Eddington ratio is low (< 10−3) and it might be still in an early phase of merger-driven AGN activity.
