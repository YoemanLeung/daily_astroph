* [The influence of metagalactic ultra-violet background fluctuations on the high-redshift Lyα forest](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.00828)
    * At high redshifts fluctuations in the UV background are dominated by QSO shot noise and have an autocorrelation length of a few to several comoving Mpcs, depending on the bright end of the QSO luminosity function.
    * the coherence may account for the broad distribution in effective optical depths measured in the Lyα forest spectra of background QSOs

* [T-ReX: a graph-based filament detection method](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.00732)
    * **Interesting, Study**
    * While nodes of the network are widely studied in the literature, simulations indicate that half of the mass budget comes from a more diffuse part of the network made of filaments.
    * We propose a new approach to automatically retrieve the underlying filamentary structure from a 2D or 3D galaxy distribution using graph theory and the assumption that paths linking galaxies together with the minimum total length highlight the underlying distribution.

* [Probing the azimuthal environment of galaxies around clusters. From cluster core to cosmic filaments](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.00655)
    * **Relevant**
    * We use the multipole analysis to quantify asymmetries in the 2-D galaxy distribution. In the inner cluster regions at R < 2R500, we confirm that the galaxy distribution traces an ellipsoidal shape, which is more pronounced for richest clusters.
    * In the clusters’ outskirts (R = [2 − 8]R500), filamentary patterns are detected in harmonic space with a mean angular scale mmean = 4.2±0.1.
    * We also find that passive galaxies appear to better trace the filamentary structures around clusters, even if the contribution of SF ones tend to increase with the cluster-centric distance, suggesting a gradient of galaxy activity in filaments around clusters.

* [Globular clusters in the stellar stream surrounding the Milky Way analog NGC 5907](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.00999)
    * We identify and obtain the kinematics of several GCs superimposed on the stellar stream and the galaxy disk. We estimate the total number of globular clusters in NGC 5907 to be 154 ± 44
    * Our analysis also reveals a significant, new population of young star cluster candidates found mostly along the outskirts of the stellar disk

* [Cosmic evolution of star-forming galaxies to z≃1.8 in the faint low-frequency radio source population](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.00934)
    * We find that the IRRC of star-forming galaxies, quantified by the infrared-to-1.4 GHz radio luminosity ratio qIR, decreases with increasing redshift to z=1.8
    * Strong luminosity evolution, basically no density evolution
    * Our sample reproduces the expected steep decline in the star formation rate density since z ∼ 1.

* [X-ray spectral shape variations in changing-look Seyfert galaxy SDSSJ155258+273728](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.00164)
    * The broad Hα line intensity increased by a factor of ∼4 in a decade. Accompanied with this, the X-ray emission detected by Chandra was about five times brighter
    * The X-ray spectrum flattens in the Chandra bright state
    * V-shape X-ray behavior: above a critical turn-over luminosity the X-ray spectra soften with the increasing luminosity, and below that luminosity the trend is reversed in a way of “harder when brighter”.

* [An ALMA CO(2-1) Survey of Nearby Palomar-Green Quasars](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.00085)
    * We present a new CO(2–1) survey of 23 z < 0.1 Palomar-Green quasars conducted with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array. 91% 都有探测
    * r21比值 subthermal，和其他近邻星系和QSO类似
    * As with the general galaxy population, quasar host galaxies exhibit a strong, tight, linear LIR–L′CO(1–0) relation

* [Stellar population properties of individual massive early-type galaxies at 1.4 < z < 2](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.00084)
    * **Relevant**
    * We analyse publicly available, individual spectra of four, massive (M > 1011M⊙) early-type galaxies with redshifts in the range 1.4 ≤ z ≤ 2 看UV indices的作用
    * 不同方法得到的age很一致：We find galaxy ages ranging from 0.2 to 4 Gyr, where the oldest galaxy is found at the lowest redshift
    * For the oldest galaxy (4 Gyr) we show that its UV-indices can only be explained by stellar population models including a UV contribution from old stellar populations
    * This is the highest redshift (z ∼ 1.4) detection of the UV-upturn up to date.

* [A DECam View of the Diffuse Dwarf Galaxy Crater II: Variable Stars](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.00081)
    * Identification and characterization of 130 periodic variable stars, including 98 RR Lyrae stars 定出了更准确的距离
    * The distribution of the RR Lyrae stars suggests an elliptical shape for Crater II, with an ellipticity of 0.24

### Dec 4

* [The CO(3-2)/CO(1-0) luminosity line ratio in nearby star-forming galaxies and AGN from xCOLD GASS, BASS and SLUGS](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.01026)
    * r31=L'CO(3-2)/L'CO(1-0): 在近邻星系中随SFE升高; 主要是受到气体密度的影响，星际辐射场强度和宇宙线电离率是另外的原因
    * 当sSFR匹配的时候，SFG和AGN Host中的r31没有差别；X-ray只在高光度和高气体密度的时候才会对CO线比值升高产生影响

* [CHILES VI: HI and Hα Observations for z < 0.1 Galaxies; Probing HI Spin Alignment with Filaments in the Cosmic Web](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.01062)
    * HI+Halpha观测COSMOS中的SF星系：We find that although the majority of galaxies show irregularities in the morphology and kinematics, they generally follow the scaling relations found in larger samples
    * Our results show that galaxy spins tend to be aligned with cosmic web filaments and show a hint of a transition mass associated with the spin angle alignment.

* [Momentum Injection by Clustered Supernovae: Testing Subgrid Feedback Prescriptions](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.01141)
    * 测试三个SNe反馈模型：
        * Delayed cooling (e.g., used in the GASOLINE-2 code)
        * Momentum-energy injection (a resolution-dependent transition between momentum-dominated feedback and energy-dominated feedback used, e.g., in the FIRE-2 code)
        * Simultaneous energy injection (e.g., used in the EAGLE simulations).
    * We test how well these models reproduce the enhanced momentum efficiency seen for an 11 SN cluster simulated at high resolution

* [An image of the dust sublimation region in the nucleus of NGC 1068](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.01361)
    * The extensive baseline coverage from 5 to 60 Mλ allowed us to reconstruct a continuum image of the nucleus with an unrivaled 0.2 pc resolution in the K-band
    * We find a thin ring-like structure of emission with a radius r = 0.24±0.03 pc, inclination i = 70 ± 5◦, position angle PA = −50 ± 4◦, and h/r < 0.14, which we associate with the dust sublimation region 和预期中的厚盘不一样，但和22GHz的maser disc很像

* [Toward the low-scatter selection of X-ray clusters: cluster detection by outskirts for eROSITA](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.01024)
    * **Relevant, Interesting**
    * We design the output of the cluster detection which enables calibrating the core-excised luminosity using external mass measurements
    * Galaxy cluster detection by outskirts improves the cluster characterization using eROSITA survey data and is expected to yield well characterized cluster catalogs having simple selection functions

* [Reionization history constraints from neural network based predictions of high-redshift quasar continua](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.01050)
    * We present a novel machine learning approach, using artificial neural networks, to reconstruct quasar continua around Lyα

* [Measuring the BAO peak position with different galaxy selections](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.01099)
    * 看能否找到一个挑选星系的方式，能够优化BAO的探测：We find that the BAO peak position is recovered equally well for samples defined by luminosity or colour, while there is a bias in the BAO scale recovered for samples defined by density.

* [Barry and the BAO Model Comparison](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.01175)
    * 比较BAO测量的模型和方法：Models that provide physical descriptions of the damping of the BAO feature (using e.g., standard perturbation or effective-field theory arguments) report smaller errors on average
    * We implement a procedure for combining all models into a single consensus result that improves over the standard method without obviously underestimating the uncertainties.

* [AVIATOR: Morphological object reconstruction in 3D. An application to dense cores](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.01005)
    * https://github.com/BirgitHa/AVIATOR

* [Non-steady heating of cool cores of galaxy clusters by ubiquitous turbulence and AGN](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.01012)
    * We study the heating of cool-core clusters by the ubiquitous turbulence as well as feedback from the central active galactic nuclei (AGNs).
    * The cluster core maintains a quasi-equilibrium state for most of the time because the heating through turbulent diffusion is nearly balanced with radiative cooling
    * When the AGN bursts, the core is heated almost instantaneously. Thanks to the pre-existing turbulence, the heated gas is distributed throughout the core without triggering thermal instability and causing catastrophic cooling, and the core recovers the quasi-equilibrium state.

### Dec 5

* [Physical Models for the Clustering of Obscured and Unobscured Quasars](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.01026)
    * Obscuring QSO的clustering比unobscured的更高，说明halo质量更高，和简单的AGN统一模型不符合
    * Observed relationships between obscuration and Eddington ratio or stellar mass are not sufficient reproduce the observed quasar clustering results

* [X-shooter Spectroscopy and HST Imaging of 15 Ultra Massive Quiescent Galaxies at z≳2](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.01619)
    * **Relevant, Interesting**
    * z>2的logM*>11.5星系的光谱观测；Size很compact，但是恒星速度弥散度和近邻的大质量椭圆星系很接近
    * The HST images reveal, as surprisingly high, that 40 % of the sample have tidal features suggestive of mergers and companions in close proximity, including three galaxies experiencing ongoing major mergers.

* [The ALPINE-ALMA [CII] Survey: Multi-Wavelength Ancillary Data and Basic Physical Measurements](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.01621)
    * **Important**
    * The first large multi-wavelength survey which aims at characterizing the gas and dust properties of 118 main-sequence galaxies at redshifts 4.4 < z < 5.9 via the measurement of [CII] emission at 158 micro-meter and the surrounding far-infrared (FIR) continuum
    * we find that the ALPINE sample is representative of the 4 < z < 6 galaxy population and only slightly biased towards bluer colors (Δβ ~ 0.2)

* [Discovery of Protoclusters at z~3.7 & 4.9: Embedded in Primordial Superclusters](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.01625)
    * We have carried out follow-up spectroscopy on three overdense regions of g- and r-dropout galaxies in the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope Legacy Survey Deep Fields, finding two new protoclusters at z=4.898, 3.721
    * These systems including protoclusters and neighboring groups are regarded as the early phase of superclusters.

* [The rest-frame UV luminosity function at z≃4: a significant contribution of AGN to the bright-end of the galaxy population](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.01626)
    * COSMOS+XMM场中的高红移星系的光度函数：We simultaneously fit for both AGN and galaxy LFs using a combination of Schechter or Double Power Law (DPL) functions alongside a single power law for the faint-end slope of the AGN LF.
    * We find a lack of evolution in the shape of the bright-end of the LBG component when compared to other studies at z≃5 and evolutionary recipes for the UV LF

* [The [α/Fe]-[Fe/H] relation in the E-MOSAICS simulations: its connection to the birth place of globular clusters and the fraction of globular cluster field stars in the bulge](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.01660)
    * The [{\alpha}/Fe]-[Fe/H] distribution of GCs largely follows that of the field stars and can also therefore be used as tracers of the [{\alpha}/Fe]-[Fe/H] evolution of the galaxy.
    * If a GC is observed to have low [{\alpha}/Fe] for its [Fe/H] there is an increased probability that this GC was accreted recently alongside a dwarf galaxy
    * 很多模拟中的bulge里面的高alpha/Fe的恒星都是来自瓦解的GC

### Dec 6

* [RELICS: A Very Large (θE∼40") Cluster Lens -- RXC J0032.1+1808](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.02702)
    * Here we report another very large cluster lens, RXC J0032.1+1808 (at z=0.3956), the second richest cluster in the redMapper cluster catalog and the 85th most massive cluster in the Planck Sunyaev-Zel'dovich catalog
    * All models reveal a large effective Einstein radius of θE≃40" (zs=2).

* [LyaCoLoRe: Synthetic Datasets for Current and Future Lyman-α Forest BAO Surveys](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.02763)
    * LyaCoLoRe: Synthetic Datasets for Current and Future Lyman-α Forest BAO Surveys

* [Elemental Abundances in M31: The Kinematics and Chemical Evolution of Dwarf Spheroidal Satellite Galaxies](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.02186)
    * Our measurements confirm that M31 satellites obey the same relation between stellar mass and stellar metallicity as Milky Way (MW) satellites and other dwarf galaxies in the Local Group
    * The trends of [α/Fe] with [Fe/H] also follow the same galaxy mass-dependent patterns as MW satellites

* [The correlations between optical/UV broad lines and X-ray emission for a large sample of quasars](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.02189)
    * We find significant correlations (at the ≥ 99.99% level) between αox and these emission-line parameters, as well as between ∆αox and C iv EW.
    * The best-fit relationships for our typical quasars are consistent with predictions from the disk-wind quasar model

* [Constraining Galactic Structure with the LISA White Dwarf Foreground](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.02200)
    * **Interesting**
    * White dwarfs 是很好的银河系老年星族示踪器：the Galactic population of double white dwarf binaries gives rise to a millihertz gravitational-wave foreground detectable by the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA)
    * We find that the level of anisotropy in the white dwarf foreground's angular power spectrum is strongly dependent on the vertical scale height of the population.

* [The impact of star formation sampling effects on the spectra of lensed z>6 galaxies detectable with JWST](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.02201)
    * 未来JWST能观测到很多SFR极低的高红移星系，必须要考虑IMF sampling和SFH变化的问题
    * We use the SLUG spectral synthesis code to demonstrate that such effects are likely to have significant impacts on spectral diagnostics of, for example, the Balmer emission lines.
    * 主要是对Myr时标上变化的

* [The East Asian Observatory SCUBA--2 survey of the COSMOS field: unveiling 1147 bright sub-millimeter sources across 2.6 square degrees](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.02229)
    * We present a catalogue of 1020 and 127 sources detected at a significance level of >4σ and >4.3σ in the 1.6 deg^2 COSMOS survey
    * The bulk of these galaxies represent near-infrared-selected SMGs and/or spatially-correlated sources and lie at a median photometric redshift of z=2.0±0.1.

* [The role of environment in galaxy evolution in the SERVS Survey I: density maps and cluster candidates](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.02238)
    * 用基于Photo-z的galaxy catalog找overdensity：Using these maps, we identify 339 overdensities that our simulated lightcone analysis suggests are likely associated with dark matter haloes with masses, Mhalo, log(Mhalo/M⊙)>13.7.
    * The bulk of the overdensities are compact, but a quarter show extended morphologies which include likely projection effects

* [A Catalog of Emission-Line Galaxies from the Faint Infrared Grism Survey: Studying Environmental Influence on Star Formation](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.02261)
    * FIGS巡天的发射线星系catalog：We present a catalog of 208 0.3 < z < 2.1 Emission Line Galaxies (ELG)
    * We use 7th-nearest-neighbor distances to investigate the typical surroundings of ELGs compared to non-ELGs, and we find that [OIII] emitters are preferentially found at intermediate galaxy densities near galaxy groups
    * SFR基本不受环境影响：We calculate star formation rates (SFR), and find no dependence of SFR on local galaxy surface density for 0.3 < z < 0.8 Hα emitters and for 0.8 < z < 1.3 [OIII] emitters.

* [On the origin of the asymmetric dwarf galaxy distribution around Andromeda](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.02393)
    * We find that some dwarf galaxies are required to have highly eccentric orbits in order to preserve the presence of the hemispherical asymmetry with an appropriately large radial dispersion.
    * The overlap of initial conditions required to produce the radial dispersion, angular dispersion, and the planar structure is small and suggests that either they did not originate from a single accretion event, or that these asymmetric structures are short-lived.

* [The HASHTAG project I. A Survey of CO(3-2) Emission from the Star Forming Disc of M31](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.02403)
    * Spanning a deprojected radial range of 2 - 14 kpc across the M31 disc
    * Explore the radial distribution of the CO(3-2)/CO(1-0) integrated intensity ratio (R31) and its relationship with dust temperature and star formation.
    * We find that the value of R31 between 2 - 9 kpc galactocentric radius is 0.14, significantly lower than what is seen in the nuclear ring at ~1 kpc (R31 ~ 0.8), only to rise again to 0.27 for the fields centred on the 10 kpc star forming ring.

* [Obscuring fraction of active galactic nuclei implied by supernova and radiative feedbacks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.02408)
    * We suppose that the mass accretion onto a central supermassive black hole (SMBH) is triggered by SN-driven turbulence within CNDs, and we explore how the structures of CNDs depend on the BH mass (MBH) and AGN luminosity (LAGN).
    * 在低AGN光度时，CND的标高决定于SN驱动的吸积过程：dusty molecular gas in CNDs is blown away by the radiation pressure from AGNs beyond the critical luminosity.
    * 对>10^8 Msun的SMBH，obscuring fraction低于0.2; CND的标高由CND上的最大恒星形成效率决定

* [Sardinia Radio Telescope observations of Local Group dwarf galaxies -- I. The cases of NGC6822, IC1613, and WLM](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.02454)
    * 在local group galaxy里面找maser，最终目的是测自行
    * We have mapped three Local Group galaxies, NGC6822, IC1613 and WLM in the bands covering the water vapor and methanol lines. 因为SFR很低，和预期一样，没有找到
    * This indicates that dwarf galaxies may follow predictions on the RC-SFR relation only in individual regions of enhanced radio continuum emission, but not when considering the entire optical body of the sources.

### Dec 9

* [XXL Survey groups and clusters in the Hyper Suprime-Cam Survey. Scaling relations between X-ray properties and weak lensing mass](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.02827)
    * **Relevant**
    * We found some evidence for steeper than self-similar slopes for gas mass (βmg|m=1.73±0.80) and luminosity (βl|m=1.91±0.94) and a nearly self-similar slope for the temperature
    * Intrinsic scatters of X-ray properties appear to be positively correlated at a fixed mass (median correlation factor ρX1X2|m∼0.34) due to dynamical state and merger history of the halos.

* [CODEX clusters. The Survey, the Catalog, and Cosmology of the X-ray Luminosity Function](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.03262)
    * We perform a wavelet detection of X-ray sources and make extensive simulations of the detection of clusters in the RASS data. We assign an optical richness to each of the 24,788 detected X-ray sources in the 10,382 square degrees of SDSS BOSS area, using redMaPPer version 5.2.
    * Our results on z<0.3 XLF are in agreement with previous studies, while we provide new constraints on the 0.3< z < 0.6 XLF. We find a lack of strong redshift evolution of the XLF and consider possibilities to explain it within a flat ΛCDM.

* [No significant evolution of relations between Black hole mass and Galaxy total stellar mass up to z~2.5](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.02824)
    * **Interesting**
    * 黑洞质量来自SED拟合加上decomposition：we find no significant evolution of the MBH-Mstellar relation with black hole-to-host total stellar mass ratio of MBH/Mstellar~0.3% at all redshifts probed.

* [BreakBRD Galaxies I: Global Properties of Spiral Galaxies with Central Star Formation in Red Disks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.02829)
    * low stellar mass, bars, and high-density environments 不能解释所有的中心SF，盘上无SF的星系
    * 和sSFR更高以及更低的星系比，在SFR，color和形态上都居中

* [Galaxy sizes and the galaxy-halo connection -- I: the remarkable tightness of the size distributions](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.02831)
    * **Relevant**
    * We find that the data require extremely tight relations for both early-type and late-type galaxies (ETGs,LTGs), especially for more massive galaxies. These constraints challenge models based solely on angular momentum conservation, which predict significantly wider distributions of galaxy sizes and no trend with stellar mass
    * We argue that the measured tight size distributions of SDSS disk galaxies can be reproduced by semi-empirical models in which the Re−Rh connection is mediated by the \emph{stellar} specific angular momenta jstar.

* [Models of Bars with Exponential Density Profiles](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.02834)
    * A new model for galactic bars with exponentially falling major axis luminosity profiles and Gaussian cross-sections. This is based on the linear superposition of Gaussian potential-density pairs with an exponential weight function
    * Our model reveals a variety of unexpected orbital structure, including a bifurcating x1 orbit coexisting with a stable x4 orbit. Propeller orbits are found to play a dominant role in the orbital structure
    * We find a candidate orbital family, sired from the propeller orbits, that may be responsible for the observed high velocity peaks in the Milky Way's bar

* [The ALMA Frontier Fields survey V: ALMA Stacking of Lyman-Break Galaxies in Abell 2744, Abell 370, Abell S1063, MACSJ0416.1-2403 and MACSJ1149.5+2223](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.02916)
    * We investigated our detections and upper limits in the context of the IRX-M★ and IRX-β relations, probing at least one dex lower in stellar mass than past studies have done. Our upper limits exclude substantial portions of parameter space and they are sufficiently deep in a handful of cases to create mild tension with the typically assumed attenuation and consensus relations.

* [The Final SDSS-IV/SPIDERS X-ray Point Source Spectroscopic Catalogue](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.03068)
    * We describe the SPIDERS X-ray Point Source Spectroscopic Catalog, which contains 11,092 observed spectra drawn from a parent sample of 14,759 ROSAT and XMM sources over an area of 5,129deg2 covered in SDSS-IV by the eBOSS survey.
    * The majority of the spectra, 10,070 are AGN, 522 are cluster galaxies, and 294 are stars.
    * Forming composite spectra of type 1 AGN as a function of the mass and accretion rate of their black holes reveal systematic differences in the H-beta emission line profiles.

* [Properties of galaxies with an offset between the position angles of the major kinematic and photometric axes](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.03233)
    * We found morphological signs of interaction in some (in 11 out of 18) but not in all galaxies.
    * We do not find any specific characteristic common to all galaxies with large dPA. Instead, the properties of these galaxies are similar to those of galaxies with small (no) dPA.

* [VLT/XShooter spectroscopy of Lyman Break Analogs: direct method O/H abundances and nitrogen enhancements](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.03239)
    * We show that the direct and strong line abundances are consistent with established relations within ~0.2 dex
    * The analogs have nitrogen-to-oxygen ratios (N/O) and ionization parameters (q) that are, on average, offset with respect to typical local galaxies but similar to galaxies at z ~ 2
    * The star formation rate surface densities are consistent with the high electron density and ionization, indicating that the interstellar medium (ISM) pressure is set by feedback from the starbursts.

* [Two Ultra-Faint Milky Way Stellar Systems Discovered in Early Data from the DECam Local Volume Exploration Survey](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.03301)
    * DECam Local Volume Exploration survey (DELVE)
    * Centaurus I is detected in Gaia DR2 with a clear and distinct proper motion signal
    * We compare the spatial position and proper motion of both Centaurus I and DELVE 1 with simulations of the accreted satellite population of the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) and find that neither is likely to be associated with the LMC.

* [Milky Way Satellite Census -- I. The Observational Selection Function for Milky Way Satellites in DES Y3 and Pan-STARRS DR1](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.03302)
    * Dark Energy Survey and Pan-STARRS1: ~25,000 deg2 of the high-Galactic-latitude sky reaching a 10σ point-source depth of ≳ 22.5 mag in the g and r bands
    * 没有发现新的候选：We use these simulations to derive both analytic and machine-learning models that accurately predict the detectability of Milky Way satellites as a function of their distance, size, luminosity, and location on the sky.

* [Milky Way Satellite Census -- II. Galaxy-Halo Connection Constraints Including the Impact of the Large Magellanic Cloud](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.03303)
    * We report decisive evidence for the statistical impact of the LMC on the MW satellite population due to an estimated 6.5±1.5 observed LMC-associated satellites, consistent with the number of LMC satellites inferred from Gaia proper motion measurements, confirming the predictions of cold dark matter models for the existence of satellites within satellite halos.
    * We infer that the LMC fell into the MW within the last 2 Gyr at high confidence

* [The BAT AGN Spectroscopic Survey -- XVIII. Searching for Supermassive Black Hole Binaries in the X-rays](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.02837)
    * Systematic search for periodic AGNs using 941 hard X-ray light curves (14-195 keV) from the first 105 months of the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) survey
    * 没有找到候选，而且即便考虑到eRosita的前景，通过X-ray光变曲线发现的几率也不高
    * Due to this effect of "red noise", we instead find that the search for SMBHBs would greatly benefit from sampling a large number of AGNs at lower cadence.

### Dec 10

* [Iterative removal of redshift space distortions from galaxy clustering](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.03392)
    * RSD降低了BAO peak的信噪比，让建模变得更困难：we introduce an iterative nonlinear reconstruction algorithm to remove RSD effects from galaxy clustering measurements
    * The new method is found to be able to recover the real-space galaxy correlation function, and reduce the quadrupole moment to zero, with a ∼1% accuracy
    * An `internal calibration' scheme is proposed to determine the values of cosmological parameters as a part of the reconstruction process, and possibilities to break parameter degeneracies are discussed.

* [Stars made in outflows may populate the stellar halo of the Milky Way](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.03392)
    * **Interesting**
    * We find that 5−40% of the outer (50−300 kpc) stellar halo in each system consists of in-situ stars that were born in outflows from the main galaxy.
    * In the outer halo, outflow stars are more spatially homogeneous, metal rich, and alpha-element-enhanced than the accreted stellar halo.
    * A stellar halo contribution from outflows is a phase-reversal of the classic halo formation scenario of Eggen, Lynden-Bell & Sandange, who suggested that halo stars formed in rapidly infalling gas clouds.

* [The AGN broad line region as a clumpy turbulent outflow: a physical basis for LOC modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.03382)
    * We consider the possibility that AGN clouds are condensations formed within the thermally unstable zones of outflows

    * BlueTides模拟里看z=7的QSO host：We find that the most massive black holes and quasars are hosted by massive galaxies with stellar masses log(M∗/M⊙)=10.8±0.2, and 10.2±0.4, which have a wide range of star formation rates
    * We find that the hosts of the most massive black holes and quasars are significantly more compact, with half-mass radii R0.5=0.29+0.15−0.10 kpc and 0.28+0.08−0.06 kpc respectively, relative to galaxies with similar masses

* [SCUBA-2 Ultra Deep Imaging Eao Survey (Studies) III: Multi-wavelength properties, luminosity functions and preliminary source catalog of 450-μm-selected galaxies](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.03669)
    * We extract 256 sources detected at 450 μm with signal-to-noise ratio > 4.0
    * We find that most of the sources are at z≲3; By fitting the far-infrared spectral energy distributions, we find that our 450-μm-selected sample has a wide range of dust temperatures (20 K ≲Td≲ 60 K)
    * We find a moderate correlation where dust temperature increases with the deviation from the SFR-M∗ relation

    * The brightest quasars can have large angular variations in galactic obscuration, over 2 orders of magnitude, where the lines of sight with the lowest obscuration are those formed via strong gas outflows driven by AGN feedback.

* [A new implementation of the Schwarzschild method for constructing observationally-driven dynamical models of galaxies of all morphological types](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.03392)
    * **Interesting**
    * Forstand, a new code for constructing dynamical models of galaxies with the Schwarzschild orbit-superposition method.
    * These models are constrained by line-of-sight kinematic observations and applicable to galaxies of all morphological types, including disks and triaxial rotating bars.

* [Variations in the slope of the resolved star-forming main sequence: a tool for constraining the mass of star-forming regions](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.04290)
    * We demonstrate that the rSFMS (resolved-) emerges naturally in FIRE-2 zoom-in simulations of Milky Way-mass galaxies.
    * While the absolute value of the SFMS slope depends on the fitting method, the slope is steeper for longer star formation time-scales and lower spatial resolutions

* [Resonance sweeping by a decelerating bar](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.04304)
    * First quantitative evidence for the deceleration/growth of the Galactic bar from local stellar kinematics thus confirming dynamical friction within expectations for a typical dark matter halo
    * 减速的棒对盘的影响和steady bar不一样：When the bar slows with rate dΩp/dt, its resonances sweep through phase space. they trap and drag along a portion of previously free orbits.
    * On the outer/inner Lindblad resonances and other higher order resonances, resonant dragging by a slowing bar is associated with a continuing increase in radial action. We compare the model to data in the action plane, identifying multiple resonance ridges.

* [The Sheet of Giants: Unusual Properties of the Milky Way's Immediate Neighbourhood](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.04307)

    * We quantify the shape and overdensity of the galaxy distribution in the `Local Sheet' within a sphere of R=8 Mpc
    * We measure ellipsoidal axis ratios of c/a≈0.16 and b/a≈0.79, indicating that the distribution of galaxies in the Local Volume can be approximated by a flattened oblate ellipsoid
    * We find that the number density of faint and bright galaxies in the Local Volume is ≈1.7 and ≈5.2 times denser, respectively, than the mean number density of galaxies of the same luminosity

    * 在z>6的8个QSO周围找到一个LBGs和LAEs的样本：measurement of the correlation between galaxies and the intergalactic medium (IGM) transmission at the end of reionisation
    * We report for the first time the detection of an excess of Lyman-α transmission spikes at ∼10−60 cMpc from LAEs (3.6σ) and LBGs (3.1σ).
    * The observed LAE(LBG)-Lyman-α transmission spike two-point cross-correlation function (2PCCF) constrains the luminosity-averaged escape fraction of all galaxies contributing to reionisation to f=0.10
    * Our results show that a contribution from faint galaxies (MUV>−20(2σ)) is necessary to reproduce the observed 2PCCF and that reionisation might be driven by different sub-populations around LBGs and LAEs at z∼6.

* [A Systematic Search for Reddest Far-infrared and Sub-millimeter Galaxies: revealing dust-embedded starbursts at high redshifts](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.04354)
    * The red FIR galaxies are "500 um risers", whose spectral energy distributions (SEDs) increase with wavelength across the three FIR passbands of the Spectral and Photometric Imaging REceiver (SPIRE) at Herschel
    * The red sub-mm galaxies are "SPIRE-dropouts", which are prominent detections in the S2CLS 850 um data but are extremely weak or invisible in the SPIRE bands.
    * Using deep radio data in these field, we find that the surface density of z>6 objects is 5.5 per sq.deg among 500 um risers and is 0.8--13.6 per sq.deg among SPIRE-dropouts

    * 模拟g-band SDSS图像，发现肉眼分类只能正确找出~50%的interacting pair
    * We find that VIP have undergone a close passage nearly twice as recently as the nonVIP, and typically have higher stellar masses
    * VIP sit in dark matter haloes that are approximately 2.5 times as massive, in environments nearly 2 times as dense, and are almost a factor of 10 more affected by the tidal forces of their surroundings than the nonVIP.

* [The Impact of Merging on The Origin of Kinematically Misaligned and Counter-rotating Galaxies in MaNGA](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.04522)
    * We crossmatch galaxies in MaNGA MPL-8 with the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) Legacy Surveys and identify 538 galaxies with merging/interacting features to investigate their position angle offsets (ΔPA) between gas and stellar rotation
    * There is a much higher merging/interacting fraction in misaligned galaxies (30∘ ⩽ ΔPA <150∘) than that in co-rotators (ΔPA < 30∘)
    * The ratio of co-rotators to counter-rotators in non-SF merging/interacting galaxies is about 8:1, much larger than the prediction from the isotropic merging (1:1), which supports the speculation that gas and stars prefer to be aligned during merging

* [The LOFAR view of NGC 3998, a sputtering AGN](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.04812)
    * We present low radio frequency observations obtained with LOFAR at 147 MHz of the radio source hosted by NGC 3998. This is a rare example of a low-power source which is extremely core-dominated, but which has two large-scale lobes of low surface brightness.
    * 看射电谱指数：Despite the low surface brightness, reminiscent of remnant structures, the lobes show an optically thin synchrotron spectral index (~ 0.6). We interpret this as being due to rapid decollimation of the jets close to the core, to high turbulence of the plasma flow, and entrainment of thermal gas.
    * Our findings show that amorphous, low surface brightness lobes should not be interpreted, by default, as remnant structures.

* [A thick disc as massive as it gets: the vertical structure of the enormous edge-on lenticular galaxy NGC7572](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.04887)

    * Here we probe the thick disc formation scenarios by investigating NGC7572, an enormous edge-on galaxy having R25≈25 kpc and Vrot≈370 km/s 比银河系质量大
    * NGC7572 contains two flaring stellar discs (a thin and a thick disc) with similar radial scales
    * The different duration of the formation epochs evidenced by the [Mg/Fe] values of +0.3 dex and +0.15 dex for the thick and thin discs respectively, their kinematics and the mass ratio suggest that in NGC7572 we observe a rapidly formed very massive thick disc

* [Large Scale Structures in the CANDELS Fields: The Role of the Environment in Star Formation Activity](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.04890)
    * **Relevant**
    * Present a robust method, weighted von Mises kernel density estimation, along with boundary correction to reconstruct the underlying number density field of galaxies
    * We find strong evidence of environmental quenching for massive galaxies (M≳1011M⊙) out to z∼3.5 such that an over-dense environment hosts ≳20% more massive quiescent galaxies compared to an under-dense region
    * The environmental quenching is also more efficient in comparison to the stellar mass quenching for low mass galaxies (M≲10^10M⊙) at low and intermediate redshifts
    * Our findings concur thoroughly with the "over-consumption" quenching model where the termination of cool gas accretion (cosmological starvation) happens in an over-dense environment and the galaxy starts to consume its remaining gas reservoir in depletion time.

* [Predicting dark matter halo formation in N-body simulations with deep regression networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.04299)
    * We implement and train a Deep Convolutional Neural Network (DCNN) to solve the task of retrieving Lagrangian patches from which dark matter halos will condense.
    * The volumetric multi-label classification task is turned into a regression problem by means of the euclidean distance transformation.
    * As a practical application, our method can be used to produce mock dark matter halo catalogues directly from the initial conditions of N-body simulations.

* [A model independent comparison of supernova and strong lensing cosmography: implications for the Hubble constant tension](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.04325)
    * We use supernovae measurements, calibrated by the local determination of the Hubble constant H0 by SH0ES, to interpolate the distance-redshift relation using Gaussian process regression
    * Our results disfavor the possibility that lens mass modeling contributes a 10% bias or uncertainty in the strong lensing analysis
    * In general our analysis strengthens the case that residual systematic errors in both measurements are below the level of the current discrepancy with the CMB determination of H0

* [CCCP and MENeaCS: (updated) weak-lensing masses for 100 galaxy clusters](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.04414)
    * **Relevant**
    * We present new results for 48 clusters at 0.05 < z < 0.15, observed as part of the Multi Epoch Nearby Cluster Survey (MENeaCS), and reevaluate the mass estimates for 52 clusters from the Canadian Cluster Comparison Project (CCCP)
    * We derive a scaling relation with Planck measurements for the full sample and find a bias in the Planck masses of 1−b=0.84±0.04.
    * We find a gas fraction of 0.139±0.014 for 8 relaxed clusters in our sample, which can also be used to infer cosmological parameters.

* [On Post-Starburst Galaxies Dominating Tidal Disruption Events](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.04372)
    * With a small enough stellar velocity dispersion (σ/vc≤0.1) in the disk, it is shown that 10^5−10^6 TDEs of solar-type main sequence stars per post-starburst galaxy (PSB) can be produced to explain their dominance in producing observed TDEs

    * Furthermore, the amplitude of the measured signal is consistent with the X-ray mass.

* [Estimating Statistical Uncertainties of Internal Kinematics of Galaxies and Star Clusters Derived Using Full Spectrum Fitting](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.05269)

    * The HST F275W and F160W images reveal that some of the low-mass galaxies (<108M⊙) have the `outside-in' growth mode: their images show a compact UV morphology, implying an ongoing star formation in the galaxy centre.

* [Modeling Dust and Starlight in Galaxies Observed by Spitzer and Herschel: The KINGFISH Sample](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.04914)
    * For each pixel in each galaxy we estimate (1) dust surface density; (2) q_PAH, the dust mass fraction in PAHs; (3) distribution of starlight intensities heating the dust; (4) luminosity emitted by the dust; and (5) dust luminosity from regions with high starlight intensity.
    * PAH尘埃质量比例在Z>0.5 Zsun处随金属丰度升高而升高
    * The global dust-to-gas ratios obtained from this study correlate with galaxy metallicities.
    * Systems with Z/Z_sol > 0.5 have most of their refractory elements locked up in dust, whereas when Z/Z_sol < 0.3 most of these elements tend to remain in the gas phase.
    * Within galaxies, we find that q_PAH is suppressed in regions with unusually warm dust

* [Modeling Dust and Starlight in Galaxies Observed by Spitzer and Herschel: The KINGFISH Sample](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.04914)
    * Before reionization, low mass halos accrete cool cosmic web gas at a very rapid rate, often reaching the highest gas mass they will ever have.
    * But when reionization occurs, we see that almost all halos lose significant quantities of their gas content, although some respond less quickly than others.

    * Derive the dynamical mass of face-on galaxy disks using their neutral hydrogen (HI) velocity dispersion
    * We find that for the large galaxies the disk dynamical and Hi gas mass surface densities are comparable in the outer disks. 
    * But in the smaller dwarf galaxies, for which the total HI gas mass dominates the baryonic mass i.e. M(HI)>M(stars), the disk dynamical mass is much larger than the baryonic mass --> there must either be a very low luminosity stellar disk which provides the vertical support for the HI gas disk or there is halo dark matter associated with their disks
