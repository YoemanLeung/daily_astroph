### Dec 4

* [The CO(3-2)/CO(1-0) luminosity line ratio in nearby star-forming galaxies and AGN from xCOLD GASS, BASS and SLUGS](https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.01026)
    * r31=L'CO(3-2)/L'CO(1-0): 在近邻星系中随SFE升高; 主要是受到气体密度的影响，星际辐射场强度和宇宙线电离率是另外的原因
    * 当sSFR匹配的时候，SFG和AGN Host中的r31没有差别；X-ray只在高光度和高气体密度的时候才会对CO线比值升高产生影响

* [CHILES VI: HI and Hα Observations for z < 0.1 Galaxies; Probing HI Spin Alignment with Filaments in the Cosmic Web](https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.01062)
    * HI+Halpha观测COSMOS中的SF星系：We find that although the majority of galaxies show irregularities in the morphology and kinematics, they generally follow the scaling relations found in larger samples
    * Our results show that galaxy spins tend to be aligned with cosmic web filaments and show a hint of a transition mass associated with the spin angle alignment. 

* [Momentum Injection by Clustered Supernovae: Testing Subgrid Feedback Prescriptions](https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.01141)
    * 测试三个SNe反馈模型：
        * Delayed cooling (e.g., used in the GASOLINE-2 code)
        * Momentum-energy injection (a resolution-dependent transition between momentum-dominated feedback and energy-dominated feedback used, e.g., in the FIRE-2 code)
        * Simultaneous energy injection (e.g., used in the EAGLE simulations).
    * We test how well these models reproduce the enhanced momentum efficiency seen for an 11 SN cluster simulated at high resolution

* [An image of the dust sublimation region in the nucleus of NGC 1068](https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.01361)
    * The extensive baseline coverage from 5 to 60 Mλ allowed us to reconstruct a continuum image of the nucleus with an unrivaled 0.2 pc resolution in the K-band
    * We find a thin ring-like structure of emission with a radius r = 0.24±0.03 pc, inclination i = 70 ± 5◦, position angle PA = −50 ± 4◦, and h/r < 0.14, which we associate with the dust sublimation region 和预期中的厚盘不一样，但和22GHz的maser disc很像

* [Toward the low-scatter selection of X-ray clusters: cluster detection by outskirts for eROSITA](https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.01024)
    * **Relevant, Interesting**
    * We design the output of the cluster detection which enables calibrating the core-excised luminosity using external mass measurements
    * Galaxy cluster detection by outskirts improves the cluster characterization using eROSITA survey data and is expected to yield well characterized cluster catalogs having simple selection functions

* [Reionization history constraints from neural network based predictions of high-redshift quasar continua](https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.01050)
    * We present a novel machine learning approach, using artificial neural networks, to reconstruct quasar continua around Lyα

* [Measuring the BAO peak position with different galaxy selections](https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.01099)
    * 看能否找到一个挑选星系的方式，能够优化BAO的探测：We find that the BAO peak position is recovered equally well for samples defined by luminosity or colour, while there is a bias in the BAO scale recovered for samples defined by density.

* [Barry and the BAO Model Comparison](https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.01175)
    * 比较BAO测量的模型和方法：Models that provide physical descriptions of the damping of the BAO feature (using e.g., standard perturbation or effective-field theory arguments) report smaller errors on average
    * We implement a procedure for combining all models into a single consensus result that improves over the standard method without obviously underestimating the uncertainties. 

* [AVIATOR: Morphological object reconstruction in 3D. An application to dense cores](https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.01005)
    * https://github.com/BirgitHa/AVIATOR

* [Non-steady heating of cool cores of galaxy clusters by ubiquitous turbulence and AGN](https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.01012)
    * We study the heating of cool-core clusters by the ubiquitous turbulence as well as feedback from the central active galactic nuclei (AGNs).
    * The cluster core maintains a quasi-equilibrium state for most of the time because the heating through turbulent diffusion is nearly balanced with radiative cooling 
    * When the AGN bursts, the core is heated almost instantaneously. Thanks to the pre-existing turbulence, the heated gas is distributed throughout the core without triggering thermal instability and causing catastrophic cooling, and the core recovers the quasi-equilibrium state.

### Dec 5

* [Physical Models for the Clustering of Obscured and Unobscured Quasars](https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.01026)
    * Obscuring QSO的clustering比unobscured的更高，说明halo质量更高，和简单的AGN统一模型不符合
    * Observed relationships between obscuration and Eddington ratio or stellar mass are not sufficient reproduce the observed quasar clustering results

* [X-shooter Spectroscopy and HST Imaging of 15 Ultra Massive Quiescent Galaxies at z≳2](https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.01619)
    * **Relevant, Interesting**
    * z>2的logM*>11.5星系的光谱观测；Size很compact，但是恒星速度弥散度和近邻的大质量椭圆星系很接近
    * The HST images reveal, as surprisingly high, that 40 % of the sample have tidal features suggestive of mergers and companions in close proximity, including three galaxies experiencing ongoing major mergers.

* [The ALPINE-ALMA [CII] Survey: Multi-Wavelength Ancillary Data and Basic Physical Measurements](https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.01621)
    * **Important**
    * The first large multi-wavelength survey which aims at characterizing the gas and dust properties of 118 main-sequence galaxies at redshifts 4.4 < z < 5.9 via the measurement of [CII] emission at 158 micro-meter and the surrounding far-infrared (FIR) continuum
    * we find that the ALPINE sample is representative of the 4 < z < 6 galaxy population and only slightly biased towards bluer colors (Δβ ~ 0.2)

* [Discovery of Protoclusters at z~3.7 & 4.9: Embedded in Primordial Superclusters](https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.01625)
    * We have carried out follow-up spectroscopy on three overdense regions of g- and r-dropout galaxies in the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope Legacy Survey Deep Fields, finding two new protoclusters at z=4.898, 3.721
    * These systems including protoclusters and neighboring groups are regarded as the early phase of superclusters.

* [The rest-frame UV luminosity function at z≃4: a significant contribution of AGN to the bright-end of the galaxy population](https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.01626)
    * COSMOS+XMM场中的高红移星系的光度函数：We simultaneously fit for both AGN and galaxy LFs using a combination of Schechter or Double Power Law (DPL) functions alongside a single power law for the faint-end slope of the AGN LF.
    * We find a lack of evolution in the shape of the bright-end of the LBG component when compared to other studies at z≃5 and evolutionary recipes for the UV LF

* [The [α/Fe]-[Fe/H] relation in the E-MOSAICS simulations: its connection to the birth place of globular clusters and the fraction of globular cluster field stars in the bulge](https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.01660)
    * The [{\alpha}/Fe]-[Fe/H] distribution of GCs largely follows that of the field stars and can also therefore be used as tracers of the [{\alpha}/Fe]-[Fe/H] evolution of the galaxy.
    * If a GC is observed to have low [{\alpha}/Fe] for its [Fe/H] there is an increased probability that this GC was accreted recently alongside a dwarf galaxy
    * 很多模拟中的bulge里面的高alpha/Fe的恒星都是来自瓦解的GC
