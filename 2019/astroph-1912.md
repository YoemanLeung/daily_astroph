* [The influence of metagalactic ultra-violet background fluctuations on the high-redshift Lyα forest](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.00828)
    * At high redshifts fluctuations in the UV background are dominated by QSO shot noise and have an autocorrelation length of a few to several comoving Mpcs, depending on the bright end of the QSO luminosity function.
    * the coherence may account for the broad distribution in effective optical depths measured in the Lyα forest spectra of background QSOs

* [T-ReX: a graph-based filament detection method](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.00732)
    * **Interesting, Study**
    * While nodes of the network are widely studied in the literature, simulations indicate that half of the mass budget comes from a more diffuse part of the network made of filaments.
    * We propose a new approach to automatically retrieve the underlying filamentary structure from a 2D or 3D galaxy distribution using graph theory and the assumption that paths linking galaxies together with the minimum total length highlight the underlying distribution.

* [Probing the azimuthal environment of galaxies around clusters. From cluster core to cosmic filaments](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.00655)
    * **Relevant**
    * We use the multipole analysis to quantify asymmetries in the 2-D galaxy distribution. In the inner cluster regions at R < 2R500, we confirm that the galaxy distribution traces an ellipsoidal shape, which is more pronounced for richest clusters.
    * In the clusters’ outskirts (R = [2 − 8]R500), filamentary patterns are detected in harmonic space with a mean angular scale mmean = 4.2±0.1.
    * We also find that passive galaxies appear to better trace the filamentary structures around clusters, even if the contribution of SF ones tend to increase with the cluster-centric distance, suggesting a gradient of galaxy activity in filaments around clusters.

* [Globular clusters in the stellar stream surrounding the Milky Way analog NGC 5907](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.00999)
    * We identify and obtain the kinematics of several GCs superimposed on the stellar stream and the galaxy disk. We estimate the total number of globular clusters in NGC 5907 to be 154 ± 44
    * Our analysis also reveals a significant, new population of young star cluster candidates found mostly along the outskirts of the stellar disk

* [Cosmic evolution of star-forming galaxies to z≃1.8 in the faint low-frequency radio source population](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.00934)
    * We find that the IRRC of star-forming galaxies, quantified by the infrared-to-1.4 GHz radio luminosity ratio qIR, decreases with increasing redshift to z=1.8
    * Strong luminosity evolution, basically no density evolution
    * Our sample reproduces the expected steep decline in the star formation rate density since z ∼ 1.

* [X-ray spectral shape variations in changing-look Seyfert galaxy SDSSJ155258+273728](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.00164)
    * The broad Hα line intensity increased by a factor of ∼4 in a decade. Accompanied with this, the X-ray emission detected by Chandra was about five times brighter
    * The X-ray spectrum flattens in the Chandra bright state
    * V-shape X-ray behavior: above a critical turn-over luminosity the X-ray spectra soften with the increasing luminosity, and below that luminosity the trend is reversed in a way of “harder when brighter”.

* [An ALMA CO(2-1) Survey of Nearby Palomar-Green Quasars](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.00085)
    * We present a new CO(2–1) survey of 23 z < 0.1 Palomar-Green quasars conducted with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array. 91% 都有探测
    * r21比值 subthermal，和其他近邻星系和QSO类似
    * As with the general galaxy population, quasar host galaxies exhibit a strong, tight, linear LIR–L′CO(1–0) relation

* [Stellar population properties of individual massive early-type galaxies at 1.4 < z < 2](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.00084)
    * **Relevant**
    * We analyse publicly available, individual spectra of four, massive (M > 1011M⊙) early-type galaxies with redshifts in the range 1.4 ≤ z ≤ 2 看UV indices的作用
    * 不同方法得到的age很一致：We find galaxy ages ranging from 0.2 to 4 Gyr, where the oldest galaxy is found at the lowest redshift
    * For the oldest galaxy (4 Gyr) we show that its UV-indices can only be explained by stellar population models including a UV contribution from old stellar populations
    * This is the highest redshift (z ∼ 1.4) detection of the UV-upturn up to date.

* [A DECam View of the Diffuse Dwarf Galaxy Crater II: Variable Stars](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.00081)
    * Identification and characterization of 130 periodic variable stars, including 98 RR Lyrae stars 定出了更准确的距离
    * The distribution of the RR Lyrae stars suggests an elliptical shape for Crater II, with an ellipticity of 0.24

### Dec 4

* [The CO(3-2)/CO(1-0) luminosity line ratio in nearby star-forming galaxies and AGN from xCOLD GASS, BASS and SLUGS](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.01026)
    * r31=L'CO(3-2)/L'CO(1-0): 在近邻星系中随SFE升高; 主要是受到气体密度的影响，星际辐射场强度和宇宙线电离率是另外的原因
    * 当sSFR匹配的时候，SFG和AGN Host中的r31没有差别；X-ray只在高光度和高气体密度的时候才会对CO线比值升高产生影响

* [CHILES VI: HI and Hα Observations for z < 0.1 Galaxies; Probing HI Spin Alignment with Filaments in the Cosmic Web](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.01062)
    * HI+Halpha观测COSMOS中的SF星系：We find that although the majority of galaxies show irregularities in the morphology and kinematics, they generally follow the scaling relations found in larger samples
    * Our results show that galaxy spins tend to be aligned with cosmic web filaments and show a hint of a transition mass associated with the spin angle alignment.

* [Momentum Injection by Clustered Supernovae: Testing Subgrid Feedback Prescriptions](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.01141)
    * 测试三个SNe反馈模型：
        * Delayed cooling (e.g., used in the GASOLINE-2 code)
        * Momentum-energy injection (a resolution-dependent transition between momentum-dominated feedback and energy-dominated feedback used, e.g., in the FIRE-2 code)
        * Simultaneous energy injection (e.g., used in the EAGLE simulations).
    * We test how well these models reproduce the enhanced momentum efficiency seen for an 11 SN cluster simulated at high resolution

* [An image of the dust sublimation region in the nucleus of NGC 1068](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.01361)
    * The extensive baseline coverage from 5 to 60 Mλ allowed us to reconstruct a continuum image of the nucleus with an unrivaled 0.2 pc resolution in the K-band
    * We find a thin ring-like structure of emission with a radius r = 0.24±0.03 pc, inclination i = 70 ± 5◦, position angle PA = −50 ± 4◦, and h/r < 0.14, which we associate with the dust sublimation region 和预期中的厚盘不一样，但和22GHz的maser disc很像

* [Toward the low-scatter selection of X-ray clusters: cluster detection by outskirts for eROSITA](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.01024)
    * **Relevant, Interesting**
    * We design the output of the cluster detection which enables calibrating the core-excised luminosity using external mass measurements
    * Galaxy cluster detection by outskirts improves the cluster characterization using eROSITA survey data and is expected to yield well characterized cluster catalogs having simple selection functions

* [Reionization history constraints from neural network based predictions of high-redshift quasar continua](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.01050)
    * We present a novel machine learning approach, using artificial neural networks, to reconstruct quasar continua around Lyα

* [Measuring the BAO peak position with different galaxy selections](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.01099)
    * 看能否找到一个挑选星系的方式，能够优化BAO的探测：We find that the BAO peak position is recovered equally well for samples defined by luminosity or colour, while there is a bias in the BAO scale recovered for samples defined by density.

* [Barry and the BAO Model Comparison](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.01175)
    * 比较BAO测量的模型和方法：Models that provide physical descriptions of the damping of the BAO feature (using e.g., standard perturbation or effective-field theory arguments) report smaller errors on average
    * We implement a procedure for combining all models into a single consensus result that improves over the standard method without obviously underestimating the uncertainties.

* [AVIATOR: Morphological object reconstruction in 3D. An application to dense cores](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.01005)
    * https://github.com/BirgitHa/AVIATOR

* [Non-steady heating of cool cores of galaxy clusters by ubiquitous turbulence and AGN](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.01012)
    * We study the heating of cool-core clusters by the ubiquitous turbulence as well as feedback from the central active galactic nuclei (AGNs).
    * The cluster core maintains a quasi-equilibrium state for most of the time because the heating through turbulent diffusion is nearly balanced with radiative cooling
    * When the AGN bursts, the core is heated almost instantaneously. Thanks to the pre-existing turbulence, the heated gas is distributed throughout the core without triggering thermal instability and causing catastrophic cooling, and the core recovers the quasi-equilibrium state.

### Dec 5

* [Physical Models for the Clustering of Obscured and Unobscured Quasars](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.01026)
    * Obscuring QSO的clustering比unobscured的更高，说明halo质量更高，和简单的AGN统一模型不符合
    * Observed relationships between obscuration and Eddington ratio or stellar mass are not sufficient reproduce the observed quasar clustering results

* [X-shooter Spectroscopy and HST Imaging of 15 Ultra Massive Quiescent Galaxies at z≳2](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.01619)
    * **Relevant, Interesting**
    * z>2的logM*>11.5星系的光谱观测；Size很compact，但是恒星速度弥散度和近邻的大质量椭圆星系很接近
    * The HST images reveal, as surprisingly high, that 40 % of the sample have tidal features suggestive of mergers and companions in close proximity, including three galaxies experiencing ongoing major mergers.

* [The ALPINE-ALMA [CII] Survey: Multi-Wavelength Ancillary Data and Basic Physical Measurements](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.01621)
    * **Important**
    * The first large multi-wavelength survey which aims at characterizing the gas and dust properties of 118 main-sequence galaxies at redshifts 4.4 < z < 5.9 via the measurement of [CII] emission at 158 micro-meter and the surrounding far-infrared (FIR) continuum
    * we find that the ALPINE sample is representative of the 4 < z < 6 galaxy population and only slightly biased towards bluer colors (Δβ ~ 0.2)

* [Discovery of Protoclusters at z~3.7 & 4.9: Embedded in Primordial Superclusters](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.01625)
    * We have carried out follow-up spectroscopy on three overdense regions of g- and r-dropout galaxies in the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope Legacy Survey Deep Fields, finding two new protoclusters at z=4.898, 3.721
    * These systems including protoclusters and neighboring groups are regarded as the early phase of superclusters.

* [The rest-frame UV luminosity function at z≃4: a significant contribution of AGN to the bright-end of the galaxy population](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.01626)
    * COSMOS+XMM场中的高红移星系的光度函数：We simultaneously fit for both AGN and galaxy LFs using a combination of Schechter or Double Power Law (DPL) functions alongside a single power law for the faint-end slope of the AGN LF.
    * We find a lack of evolution in the shape of the bright-end of the LBG component when compared to other studies at z≃5 and evolutionary recipes for the UV LF

* [The [α/Fe]-[Fe/H] relation in the E-MOSAICS simulations: its connection to the birth place of globular clusters and the fraction of globular cluster field stars in the bulge](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.01660)
    * The [{\alpha}/Fe]-[Fe/H] distribution of GCs largely follows that of the field stars and can also therefore be used as tracers of the [{\alpha}/Fe]-[Fe/H] evolution of the galaxy.
    * If a GC is observed to have low [{\alpha}/Fe] for its [Fe/H] there is an increased probability that this GC was accreted recently alongside a dwarf galaxy
    * 很多模拟中的bulge里面的高alpha/Fe的恒星都是来自瓦解的GC

### Dec 6

* [RELICS: A Very Large (θE∼40") Cluster Lens -- RXC J0032.1+1808](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.02702)
    * Here we report another very large cluster lens, RXC J0032.1+1808 (at z=0.3956), the second richest cluster in the redMapper cluster catalog and the 85th most massive cluster in the Planck Sunyaev-Zel'dovich catalog
    * All models reveal a large effective Einstein radius of θE≃40" (zs=2).

* [LyaCoLoRe: Synthetic Datasets for Current and Future Lyman-α Forest BAO Surveys](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.02763)
    * LyaCoLoRe: Synthetic Datasets for Current and Future Lyman-α Forest BAO Surveys

* [Elemental Abundances in M31: The Kinematics and Chemical Evolution of Dwarf Spheroidal Satellite Galaxies](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.02186)
    * Our measurements confirm that M31 satellites obey the same relation between stellar mass and stellar metallicity as Milky Way (MW) satellites and other dwarf galaxies in the Local Group
    * The trends of [α/Fe] with [Fe/H] also follow the same galaxy mass-dependent patterns as MW satellites

* [The correlations between optical/UV broad lines and X-ray emission for a large sample of quasars](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.02189)
    * We find significant correlations (at the ≥ 99.99% level) between αox and these emission-line parameters, as well as between ∆αox and C iv EW.
    * The best-fit relationships for our typical quasars are consistent with predictions from the disk-wind quasar model

* [Constraining Galactic Structure with the LISA White Dwarf Foreground](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.02200)
    * **Interesting**
    * White dwarfs 是很好的银河系老年星族示踪器：the Galactic population of double white dwarf binaries gives rise to a millihertz gravitational-wave foreground detectable by the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA)
    * We find that the level of anisotropy in the white dwarf foreground's angular power spectrum is strongly dependent on the vertical scale height of the population.

* [The impact of star formation sampling effects on the spectra of lensed z>6 galaxies detectable with JWST](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.02201)
    * 未来JWST能观测到很多SFR极低的高红移星系，必须要考虑IMF sampling和SFH变化的问题
    * We use the SLUG spectral synthesis code to demonstrate that such effects are likely to have significant impacts on spectral diagnostics of, for example, the Balmer emission lines.
    * 主要是对Myr时标上变化的

* [The East Asian Observatory SCUBA--2 survey of the COSMOS field: unveiling 1147 bright sub-millimeter sources across 2.6 square degrees](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.02229)
    * We present a catalogue of 1020 and 127 sources detected at a significance level of >4σ and >4.3σ in the 1.6 deg^2 COSMOS survey
    * The bulk of these galaxies represent near-infrared-selected SMGs and/or spatially-correlated sources and lie at a median photometric redshift of z=2.0±0.1.

* [The role of environment in galaxy evolution in the SERVS Survey I: density maps and cluster candidates](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.02238)
    * 用基于Photo-z的galaxy catalog找overdensity：Using these maps, we identify 339 overdensities that our simulated lightcone analysis suggests are likely associated with dark matter haloes with masses, Mhalo, log(Mhalo/M⊙)>13.7.
    * The bulk of the overdensities are compact, but a quarter show extended morphologies which include likely projection effects

* [A Catalog of Emission-Line Galaxies from the Faint Infrared Grism Survey: Studying Environmental Influence on Star Formation](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.02261)
    * FIGS巡天的发射线星系catalog：We present a catalog of 208 0.3 < z < 2.1 Emission Line Galaxies (ELG)
    * We use 7th-nearest-neighbor distances to investigate the typical surroundings of ELGs compared to non-ELGs, and we find that [OIII] emitters are preferentially found at intermediate galaxy densities near galaxy groups
    * SFR基本不受环境影响：We calculate star formation rates (SFR), and find no dependence of SFR on local galaxy surface density for 0.3 < z < 0.8 Hα emitters and for 0.8 < z < 1.3 [OIII] emitters.

* [On the origin of the asymmetric dwarf galaxy distribution around Andromeda](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.02393)
    * We find that some dwarf galaxies are required to have highly eccentric orbits in order to preserve the presence of the hemispherical asymmetry with an appropriately large radial dispersion.
    * The overlap of initial conditions required to produce the radial dispersion, angular dispersion, and the planar structure is small and suggests that either they did not originate from a single accretion event, or that these asymmetric structures are short-lived.

* [The HASHTAG project I. A Survey of CO(3-2) Emission from the Star Forming Disc of M31](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.02403)
    * Spanning a deprojected radial range of 2 - 14 kpc across the M31 disc
    * Explore the radial distribution of the CO(3-2)/CO(1-0) integrated intensity ratio (R31) and its relationship with dust temperature and star formation.
    * We find that the value of R31 between 2 - 9 kpc galactocentric radius is 0.14, significantly lower than what is seen in the nuclear ring at ~1 kpc (R31 ~ 0.8), only to rise again to 0.27 for the fields centred on the 10 kpc star forming ring.

* [Obscuring fraction of active galactic nuclei implied by supernova and radiative feedbacks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.02408)
    * We suppose that the mass accretion onto a central supermassive black hole (SMBH) is triggered by SN-driven turbulence within CNDs, and we explore how the structures of CNDs depend on the BH mass (MBH) and AGN luminosity (LAGN).
    * 在低AGN光度时，CND的标高决定于SN驱动的吸积过程：dusty molecular gas in CNDs is blown away by the radiation pressure from AGNs beyond the critical luminosity.
    * 对>10^8 Msun的SMBH，obscuring fraction低于0.2; CND的标高由CND上的最大恒星形成效率决定

* [Sardinia Radio Telescope observations of Local Group dwarf galaxies -- I. The cases of NGC6822, IC1613, and WLM](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.02454)
    * 在local group galaxy里面找maser，最终目的是测自行
    * We have mapped three Local Group galaxies, NGC6822, IC1613 and WLM in the bands covering the water vapor and methanol lines. 因为SFR很低，和预期一样，没有找到
    * This indicates that dwarf galaxies may follow predictions on the RC-SFR relation only in individual regions of enhanced radio continuum emission, but not when considering the entire optical body of the sources.

### Dec 9

* [XXL Survey groups and clusters in the Hyper Suprime-Cam Survey. Scaling relations between X-ray properties and weak lensing mass](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.02827)
    * **Relevant**
    * We found some evidence for steeper than self-similar slopes for gas mass (βmg|m=1.73±0.80) and luminosity (βl|m=1.91±0.94) and a nearly self-similar slope for the temperature
    * Intrinsic scatters of X-ray properties appear to be positively correlated at a fixed mass (median correlation factor ρX1X2|m∼0.34) due to dynamical state and merger history of the halos.

* [CODEX clusters. The Survey, the Catalog, and Cosmology of the X-ray Luminosity Function](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.03262)
    * We perform a wavelet detection of X-ray sources and make extensive simulations of the detection of clusters in the RASS data. We assign an optical richness to each of the 24,788 detected X-ray sources in the 10,382 square degrees of SDSS BOSS area, using redMaPPer version 5.2.
    * Our results on z<0.3 XLF are in agreement with previous studies, while we provide new constraints on the 0.3< z < 0.6 XLF. We find a lack of strong redshift evolution of the XLF and consider possibilities to explain it within a flat ΛCDM.

* [No significant evolution of relations between Black hole mass and Galaxy total stellar mass up to z~2.5](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.02824)
    * **Interesting**
    * 黑洞质量来自SED拟合加上decomposition：we find no significant evolution of the MBH-Mstellar relation with black hole-to-host total stellar mass ratio of MBH/Mstellar~0.3% at all redshifts probed.

* [BreakBRD Galaxies I: Global Properties of Spiral Galaxies with Central Star Formation in Red Disks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.02829)
    * low stellar mass, bars, and high-density environments 不能解释所有的中心SF，盘上无SF的星系
    * 和sSFR更高以及更低的星系比，在SFR，color和形态上都居中

* [Galaxy sizes and the galaxy-halo connection -- I: the remarkable tightness of the size distributions](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.02831)
    * **Relevant**
    * We find that the data require extremely tight relations for both early-type and late-type galaxies (ETGs,LTGs), especially for more massive galaxies. These constraints challenge models based solely on angular momentum conservation, which predict significantly wider distributions of galaxy sizes and no trend with stellar mass
    * We argue that the measured tight size distributions of SDSS disk galaxies can be reproduced by semi-empirical models in which the Re−Rh connection is mediated by the \emph{stellar} specific angular momenta jstar.

* [Models of Bars with Exponential Density Profiles](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.02834)
    * A new model for galactic bars with exponentially falling major axis luminosity profiles and Gaussian cross-sections. This is based on the linear superposition of Gaussian potential-density pairs with an exponential weight function
    * Our model reveals a variety of unexpected orbital structure, including a bifurcating x1 orbit coexisting with a stable x4 orbit. Propeller orbits are found to play a dominant role in the orbital structure
    * We find a candidate orbital family, sired from the propeller orbits, that may be responsible for the observed high velocity peaks in the Milky Way's bar

* [The ALMA Frontier Fields survey V: ALMA Stacking of Lyman-Break Galaxies in Abell 2744, Abell 370, Abell S1063, MACSJ0416.1-2403 and MACSJ1149.5+2223](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.02916)
    * We investigated our detections and upper limits in the context of the IRX-M★ and IRX-β relations, probing at least one dex lower in stellar mass than past studies have done. Our upper limits exclude substantial portions of parameter space and they are sufficiently deep in a handful of cases to create mild tension with the typically assumed attenuation and consensus relations.

* [The Final SDSS-IV/SPIDERS X-ray Point Source Spectroscopic Catalogue](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.03068)
    * We describe the SPIDERS X-ray Point Source Spectroscopic Catalog, which contains 11,092 observed spectra drawn from a parent sample of 14,759 ROSAT and XMM sources over an area of 5,129deg2 covered in SDSS-IV by the eBOSS survey.
    * The majority of the spectra, 10,070 are AGN, 522 are cluster galaxies, and 294 are stars.
    * Forming composite spectra of type 1 AGN as a function of the mass and accretion rate of their black holes reveal systematic differences in the H-beta emission line profiles.

* [Properties of galaxies with an offset between the position angles of the major kinematic and photometric axes](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.03233)
    * We found morphological signs of interaction in some (in 11 out of 18) but not in all galaxies.
    * We do not find any specific characteristic common to all galaxies with large dPA. Instead, the properties of these galaxies are similar to those of galaxies with small (no) dPA.

* [VLT/XShooter spectroscopy of Lyman Break Analogs: direct method O/H abundances and nitrogen enhancements](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.03239)
    * We show that the direct and strong line abundances are consistent with established relations within ~0.2 dex
    * The analogs have nitrogen-to-oxygen ratios (N/O) and ionization parameters (q) that are, on average, offset with respect to typical local galaxies but similar to galaxies at z ~ 2
    * The star formation rate surface densities are consistent with the high electron density and ionization, indicating that the interstellar medium (ISM) pressure is set by feedback from the starbursts.

* [Two Ultra-Faint Milky Way Stellar Systems Discovered in Early Data from the DECam Local Volume Exploration Survey](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.03301)
    * DECam Local Volume Exploration survey (DELVE)
    * Centaurus I is detected in Gaia DR2 with a clear and distinct proper motion signal
    * We compare the spatial position and proper motion of both Centaurus I and DELVE 1 with simulations of the accreted satellite population of the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) and find that neither is likely to be associated with the LMC.

* [Milky Way Satellite Census -- I. The Observational Selection Function for Milky Way Satellites in DES Y3 and Pan-STARRS DR1](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.03302)
    * Dark Energy Survey and Pan-STARRS1: ~25,000 deg2 of the high-Galactic-latitude sky reaching a 10σ point-source depth of ≳ 22.5 mag in the g and r bands
    * 没有发现新的候选：We use these simulations to derive both analytic and machine-learning models that accurately predict the detectability of Milky Way satellites as a function of their distance, size, luminosity, and location on the sky.

* [Milky Way Satellite Census -- II. Galaxy-Halo Connection Constraints Including the Impact of the Large Magellanic Cloud](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.03303)
    * We report decisive evidence for the statistical impact of the LMC on the MW satellite population due to an estimated 6.5±1.5 observed LMC-associated satellites, consistent with the number of LMC satellites inferred from Gaia proper motion measurements, confirming the predictions of cold dark matter models for the existence of satellites within satellite halos.
    * We infer that the LMC fell into the MW within the last 2 Gyr at high confidence

* [The BAT AGN Spectroscopic Survey -- XVIII. Searching for Supermassive Black Hole Binaries in the X-rays](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.02837)
    * Systematic search for periodic AGNs using 941 hard X-ray light curves (14-195 keV) from the first 105 months of the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) survey
    * 没有找到候选，而且即便考虑到eRosita的前景，通过X-ray光变曲线发现的几率也不高
    * Due to this effect of "red noise", we instead find that the search for SMBHBs would greatly benefit from sampling a large number of AGNs at lower cadence.

### Dec 10

* [Iterative removal of redshift space distortions from galaxy clustering](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.03392)
    * RSD降低了BAO peak的信噪比，让建模变得更困难：we introduce an iterative nonlinear reconstruction algorithm to remove RSD effects from galaxy clustering measurements
    * The new method is found to be able to recover the real-space galaxy correlation function, and reduce the quadrupole moment to zero, with a ∼1% accuracy
    * An `internal calibration' scheme is proposed to determine the values of cosmological parameters as a part of the reconstruction process, and possibilities to break parameter degeneracies are discussed.

* [Stars made in outflows may populate the stellar halo of the Milky Way](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.03392)
    * **Interesting**
    * We find that 5−40% of the outer (50−300 kpc) stellar halo in each system consists of in-situ stars that were born in outflows from the main galaxy.
    * In the outer halo, outflow stars are more spatially homogeneous, metal rich, and alpha-element-enhanced than the accreted stellar halo.
    * A stellar halo contribution from outflows is a phase-reversal of the classic halo formation scenario of Eggen, Lynden-Bell & Sandange, who suggested that halo stars formed in rapidly infalling gas clouds.

* [The AGN broad line region as a clumpy turbulent outflow: a physical basis for LOC modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.03382)
    * We consider the possibility that AGN clouds are condensations formed within the thermally unstable zones of outflows

    * The brightest quasars can have large angular variations in galactic obscuration, over 2 orders of magnitude, where the lines of sight with the lowest obscuration are those formed via strong gas outflows driven by AGN feedback.

    * These models are constrained by line-of-sight kinematic observations and applicable to galaxies of all morphological types, including disks and triaxial rotating bars.

* [Variations in the slope of the resolved star-forming main sequence: a tool for constraining the mass of star-forming regions](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.04290)
    * We demonstrate that the rSFMS (resolved-) emerges naturally in FIRE-2 zoom-in simulations of Milky Way-mass galaxies.
    * While the absolute value of the SFMS slope depends on the fitting method, the slope is steeper for longer star formation time-scales and lower spatial resolutions

    * On the outer/inner Lindblad resonances and other higher order resonances, resonant dragging by a slowing bar is associated with a continuing increase in radial action. We compare the model to data in the action plane, identifying multiple resonance ridges.

    * We report for the first time the detection of an excess of Lyman-α transmission spikes at ∼10−60 cMpc from LAEs (3.6σ) and LBGs (3.1σ).
    * The observed LAE(LBG)-Lyman-α transmission spike two-point cross-correlation function (2PCCF) constrains the luminosity-averaged escape fraction of all galaxies contributing to reionisation to f=0.10
    * Our results show that a contribution from faint galaxies (MUV>−20(2σ)) is necessary to reproduce the observed 2PCCF and that reionisation might be driven by different sub-populations around LBGs and LAEs at z∼6.

* [A Systematic Search for Reddest Far-infrared and Sub-millimeter Galaxies: revealing dust-embedded starbursts at high redshifts](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.04354)
    * The red FIR galaxies are "500 um risers", whose spectral energy distributions (SEDs) increase with wavelength across the three FIR passbands of the Spectral and Photometric Imaging REceiver (SPIRE) at Herschel
    * The red sub-mm galaxies are "SPIRE-dropouts", which are prominent detections in the S2CLS 850 um data but are extremely weak or invisible in the SPIRE bands.
    * Using deep radio data in these field, we find that the surface density of z>6 objects is 5.5 per sq.deg among 500 um risers and is 0.8--13.6 per sq.deg among SPIRE-dropouts

* [The Impact of Merging on The Origin of Kinematically Misaligned and Counter-rotating Galaxies in MaNGA](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.04522)
    * We crossmatch galaxies in MaNGA MPL-8 with the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) Legacy Surveys and identify 538 galaxies with merging/interacting features to investigate their position angle offsets (ΔPA) between gas and stellar rotation
    * There is a much higher merging/interacting fraction in misaligned galaxies (30∘ ⩽ ΔPA <150∘) than that in co-rotators (ΔPA < 30∘)
    * The ratio of co-rotators to counter-rotators in non-SF merging/interacting galaxies is about 8:1, much larger than the prediction from the isotropic merging (1:1), which supports the speculation that gas and stars prefer to be aligned during merging

    * We present low radio frequency observations obtained with LOFAR at 147 MHz of the radio source hosted by NGC 3998. This is a rare example of a low-power source which is extremely core-dominated, but which has two large-scale lobes of low surface brightness.
    * 看射电谱指数：Despite the low surface brightness, reminiscent of remnant structures, the lobes show an optically thin synchrotron spectral index (~ 0.6). We interpret this as being due to rapid decollimation of the jets close to the core, to high turbulence of the plasma flow, and entrainment of thermal gas.
    * Our findings show that amorphous, low surface brightness lobes should not be interpreted, by default, as remnant structures.

* [A thick disc as massive as it gets: the vertical structure of the enormous edge-on lenticular galaxy NGC7572](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.04887)

    * NGC7572 contains two flaring stellar discs (a thin and a thick disc) with similar radial scales
    * The different duration of the formation epochs evidenced by the [Mg/Fe] values of +0.3 dex and +0.15 dex for the thick and thin discs respectively, their kinematics and the mass ratio suggest that in NGC7572 we observe a rapidly formed very massive thick disc

    * **Relevant**
    * Present a robust method, weighted von Mises kernel density estimation, along with boundary correction to reconstruct the underlying number density field of galaxies
    * We find strong evidence of environmental quenching for massive galaxies (M≳1011M⊙) out to z∼3.5 such that an over-dense environment hosts ≳20% more massive quiescent galaxies compared to an under-dense region
    * The environmental quenching is also more efficient in comparison to the stellar mass quenching for low mass galaxies (M≲10^10M⊙) at low and intermediate redshifts
    * Our findings concur thoroughly with the "over-consumption" quenching model where the termination of cool gas accretion (cosmological starvation) happens in an over-dense environment and the galaxy starts to consume its remaining gas reservoir in depletion time.

* [Predicting dark matter halo formation in N-body simulations with deep regression networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.04299)

    * The volumetric multi-label classification task is turned into a regression problem by means of the euclidean distance transformation.
    * As a practical application, our method can be used to produce mock dark matter halo catalogues directly from the initial conditions of N-body simulations.

    * Our results disfavor the possibility that lens mass modeling contributes a 10% bias or uncertainty in the strong lensing analysis
    * In general our analysis strengthens the case that residual systematic errors in both measurements are below the level of the current discrepancy with the CMB determination of H0

    * We derive a scaling relation with Planck measurements for the full sample and find a bias in the Planck masses of 1−b=0.84±0.04.
    * We find a gas fraction of 0.139±0.014 for 8 relaxed clusters in our sample, which can also be used to infer cosmological parameters.

    * PAH尘埃质量比例在Z>0.5 Zsun处随金属丰度升高而升高
    * The global dust-to-gas ratios obtained from this study correlate with galaxy metallicities.
    * Systems with Z/Z_sol > 0.5 have most of their refractory elements locked up in dust, whereas when Z/Z_sol < 0.3 most of these elements tend to remain in the gas phase.
    * Within galaxies, we find that q_PAH is suppressed in regions with unusually warm dust

    * Despite clear PSB spectral signatures implying rapid and violent quenching, 87% of these galaxies have symmetric, undisturbed morphologies in the stellar continuum.
    * They follow a mass-size relation lying midway between the star-forming and quiescent field relations. This implies a rapid change in the light profile without directly effecting the stellar distribution, suggesting changes in the mass-to-light ratio gradients across the galaxy are responsible.
    * Modelling a galaxy with a bulge+disc, and fading the disc from the "outside-in", can lead to the contraction in size and increase in bulge-dominance observed between star-forming and PSB cluster galaxies.

    * The fraction of less-massive satellite galaxies at z≲1 is found to be almost constant at ∼20%, but it gradually decreases beyond M*~10^10.4.
    * The abundance of satellite galaxies at z>1 is quite small even for less-massive galaxies due to the rarity of massive centrals at high-z.
    * The stellar-to-halo mass ratios at 0.3≤z≤1.4 are almost consistent with the predictions obtained using the latest empirical model; however, we identify small excesses from the theoretical model at the massive end.
    * We systematically show that 10^{12}h−1M⊙ is a universal pivot halo mass up to z∼5 that is derived using only the clustering/HOD analyses.

    * We determine the dust temperature of WISE1013+6112 is Tdust = 89 ± 3 K, which is significantly higher than that of other populations such as SMGs and FIR-selected galaxies at similar IR luminosities.

    * Locations with short gas depletion time appear to undergo bigger variations in their star-formation rates on Gyr or less timescales
    * The dispersion in star-formation rate surface densities ΣSFR in the galaxy population appears to be inversely correlated with the inferred gas depletion timescale and interpreted this in terms of the dynamical response of a gas-regulator system to changes in the gas inflow rate

    * The overall kinematics of molecular gas is similar to the one shown by the ionized gas, but for clear signatures of double components along the stripping direction
    * Molecular gas in the tail is newly born from stripped HI gas or newly condensed from stripped diffuse molecular gas.
    * A significant fraction (∼40%) of the molecular gas is extended over large scales (≥8 kpc) in the disk

* [Filament profiles from WISExSCOS galaxies as probes of the impact of environmental effects](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.06559)
    * We investigate properties of galaxy in the range 0.1< z< 0.3 from a value-added version of the WISExSCOS catalogue around cosmic filaments detected with DisPerSE.
    * We have measured an excess of passive galaxies near the filament's spine, higher than the excess of transitioning and active galaxies. 
    * We have also detected SFR and Mstar gradients pointing towards the filament's spine.

    * Tomoni的工作；围绕着PFS的光纤分配冲突展开: Such surveys will have more target galaxies than we can place fibers on. 
    * First, it eliminates fluctuations with wavelengths longer than the size of the field of view, as the number of observed galaxies per field is nearly fixed to the number of available fibers.
    * Second, it makes the preferential selection of galaxies in under-dense regions. We mitigate this effect by weighting galaxies using the so-called individual inverse probability.

* [Lensing-like tensions in the Planck legacy release](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.06601)
    * The amount of lensing determined from the smoothing of the acoustic peaks in the temperature and polarization power spectra is 2σ too high when compared with the measurements using the lensing reconstruction and 2.8σ too high when compared with ΛCDM expectation based on the "unlensed" portion of the temperature and polarization power spectra.
    * 最大的变化：driven by improved constraints to the optical depth to reionization
    * Within the context of ΛCDM, improvements in its parameter constraints from lensing reconstruction brings this tension to 2.1σ and from further adding baryon acoustic oscillation and Pantheon supernova data to a marginally higher 2.2σ

* [An analysis of galaxy cluster mis-centring using cosmological hydrodynamic simulations](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.06663)
    * **Relevant**
    * `true' centre of the cluster, which is taken to be the most gravitationally bound particle measured in the simulation
    * The galaxy-based centres can be seen to be divided into a mis-centred group and a well-centred group, with the well-centred group making up about 60% of all the clusters.
    * Gas-based centres are not as clearly divided into two groups, but are overall less scattered than galaxy-based centres.
    * Off-center距离和质量有关。Halo质量越小，越容易有比较大的offset
    * For the galaxy-based centres, this can lead to cluster masses being underestimated by up to 10 per cent.

* [Cosmicflows-3: Two Distance−Velocity Calculators](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.07214)
    * Tools are provided at the Extragalactic Distance Database website that provide relationships between the distances and velocities of galaxies based on smoothed versions of the velocity fields derived by the Cosmicflows program.

* [Gas Density Perturbations in Cool Cores of CLASH Galaxy Clusters](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.07300)
    * We focus on the X-ray residual image characteristics after subtracting their global profile of the X-ray surface brightness
    * The ICM temperature in the positive excess region is lower than that in the negative excess region, whereas the ICM in both regions is in pressure equilibrium in a systematic manner
    * Gas sloshing in cool cores takes place in more than 80% of relaxed clusters (95% CL).
    * Our findings support the picture that the gas density perturbations are induced by gas sloshing, and a large fraction of cool-core clusters have undergone gas sloshing, indicating that gas sloshing is capable of suppressing runaway cooling of the ICM.

* [Hot WHIM counterparts of FUV OVI absorbers: Evidence in the line-of-sight towards quasar 3C 273](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.06659)
    * At FUV redshift z=0.09017, we measured signals of two hot ion species, OVIII and NeIX, with a 3.9σ combined significance level. 
    * Thermal analysis indicates that FUV and X-ray absorption relate to different phases
    * We detected a large scale galactic filament crossing the sightline at the redshift of the absorption, linking the absorption to this structure.

* [Properties of galaxies and supermassive black holes in cosmic voids](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.06662)
    * Low-mass galaxies are more common than their massive counterparts at small void-centric distances. At fixed dark matter halo mass, they also have smaller stellar masses than in denser regions.
    * As a consequence of the presence of low-mass galaxies in voids, the inner regions of voids also predominantly host low-mass BHs. 但黑洞质量和星系恒星质量比例与正常环境很接近
    * While a large fraction of the BHs have low Eddington ratios, we find that 20% could be observed as AGN

    * **Relevant**
    * We report a detailed study of these young stellar populations, from high-quality stacked spectra of 28,663 galaxies from the BOSS survey, analysing optical and ultraviolet absorption lines simultaneously.
    * We find that residual star formation is ubiquitous in massive early-type galaxies, measuring average mass fractions of ~0.5% in young stars in the last 2 Gyr of their evolution. 
    * We also find that synthetic galaxies from state-of-the-art cosmological numerical simulations significantly overproduce both intermediate and young stellar populations

* [XMP gas-rich dwarfs in Nearby Voids: candidate selection](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.06740)
    * eXtremely Metal-Poor (XMP) very gas-rich blue dwarfs in voids in Lynx-Cancer void
    * These very rare and unusual galaxies appear to be the best proxies for the so-called Very Young Galaxies (VYGs)
    * We find that this study results in the discovery of many new XMP dwarfs with 12+log(O/H) ~ 7.0-7.3 dex.

* [XMP gas-rich dwarfs in Nearby Voids: results of SALT spectroscopy](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.06857)
    * SALT follow-up of 26 XMP galaxies
    * For ten of them, the oxygen abundance is found to be very low, in the range of 12+log(O/H)=6.95-7.30 dex. Of those, four void dwarfs have 12+log(O/H) < 7.19

* [VEGAS: VST Early-type GAlaxy Survey. V. IC 1459 group: Mass assembly history in low density environments](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.07452)
    * The wide field of view, long integration time, high angular resolution, and arcsec-level seeing of OmegaCAM@VST allow us to map the light distribution of IC1459 down to a surface brightness level of 29.26 mag arcsec^{-2} in g band and 28.85 mag arcsec^{-2} in r band, and out to 7-10 Re, and to detect the optical counterpart of HI gas around IC1459.
    * There is a good agreement of our results with predictions of numerical simulations regarding the structural properties of the brightest galaxies of the groups.

* [Relativistic SZ temperature scaling relations of groups and clusters derived from the BAHAMAS and MACSIS simulations](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.07924)
    * Using the BAHAMAS and MACSIS simulations to obtain >10,000 simulated galaxy groups and clusters, we compute three temperature measures and quantify the differences between them.
    * The third measure determines the lowest order relativistic correction to the tSZ signal, which is seeing increased observational relevance

* [TDCOSMO. I. An exploration of systematic uncertainties in the inference of H0 from time-delay cosmography](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.08027)
    * We investigate three potential sources: 1- stellar kinematics, 2- line-of-sight effects, 3- deflector mass model.
    * Stellar kinematics cannot be a dominant source of error or bias given current uncertainties.
    * We find no bias arising from incorrect estimation of the line-of-sight effects
    * The TDCOSMO procedures to model the data with both composite and power-law mass profiles are informative.

* [Probing the origin of diffuse radio emission in the cool-core of the Phoenix galaxy cluster](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.07853)
    * We detect spiraling cool gas around the cluster core as well as discover two cold fronts near the core.

* [First detection of the [OI] 63-um emission from a redshift 6 dusty galaxy](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.07652)
    * **Interesting**
    * APEX SEPIA: ground-based detection of the [OI] 63-um line in a z=6.027 gravitationally lensed dusty star-forming galaxy
    * With the [OI]63/[CII] luminosity ratio of 4, the [OI]63 line is the main coolant of the neutral gas in this galaxy, in agreement with model predictions.
    * The high [OI]63 luminosity compensates for the pronounced [CII] deficit
    * If G09.83808 represents a typical high-redshift DSFG, the [OI]63 line from z=6 non-lensed DSFGs should be routinely detectable in ALMA Band 9 observations with ∼15 min on-source
    * In a dense, warm ISM - such as that in DSFGs or present-day (ultra)luminous infrared galaxies (ULIRGs) - the [O I] 63-µm line ([O I]63) overtakes [C II] as the main gas cooling channel

* [LLAMA: The MBH - σ⋆ Relation of the most luminous local AGNs](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.07734)
    * Super-massive black hole masses (MBH) were derived from the broad-line based relations for Hα, Hβ and Paβ emission line profiles for the Type 1 AGNs
    * We compare the bulge stellar velocity dispersion (σ⋆) as determined from the Ca II triplet (CaT) with the dispersion measured from the near-infrared CO (2-0) absorption features for each AGN and find them to be consistent with each other.
    * We find that our sample of local luminous AGNs is consistent with the MBH - σ⋆ relation of lower luminosity AGNs and inactive galaxies, after correcting for dust extinction and the rotational contribution to the stellar velocity dispersion.

* [Stellar populations and physical properties of starbursts in the Antennae galaxy from self-consistent modelling of MUSE spectra](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.08151)
    * SB99+Cloudy using Geneva & PARSEC: Using a spectrum-fitting methodology that allows the spectral features in the stellar and nebular continua (e.g. Wolf-Rayet features, Paschen jump), and emission-line diagnostics to constrain the models, we apply the libraries to the high-resolution MUSE spectra of the starbursting regions in the Antennae galaxy.
    * The starbursts in the Antennae galaxy are characterised by stellar and gas metallicities of around solar
    * The youngest starbursts are found across the overlap region and over parts of the western-loop, though in comparison, the regions in the western-loop appear to be at a slightly later stage in star-formation than the overlap region

### Dec 19

* [A mass threshold for galactic gas discs by spin flips](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.08213)
    * We predict, analytically and by simulations, that gas discs tend to survive only in haloes above a threshold mass 2x10^11 Msun
    * At lower masses, the disc spins typically flip in less than an orbital time due to mergers associated with a change in the pattern of the feeding cosmic-web streams.
    * Above the threshold, wet compactions lead to massive central nuggets that allow the longevity of extended clumpy gas rings. Supernova feedback has a major role in disrupting discs below the critical mass, by driving the stellar-to-halo mass ratio that affects the merger rate

* [Spatial segregation of massive clusters in dwarf galaxies](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.08293)
    * LEGUS survey: Class 2 and 3 LEGUS clusters, which have a more irregular internal structure than the compact and symmetric class 1 clusters, are found to be mass segregated in low mass galaxies, which means that the more massive clusters are systematically bunched together compared to the lower mass clusters.

* [A consistency-test for determining whether ultra-compact dwarf galaxies could be the remnant nuclei of threshed galaxies](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.08346)
    * If the mass of the central black hole in UCD galaxies, relative to the mass of the UCD galaxies' inner stellar component, i.e. the suspected nuclear star cluster, matches with the (black hole mass)-(nuclear star cluster mass) relation observed in other galaxies, then it would provide quantitative support for the stripped galaxy scenario.

* [The Nuker model for galactic nuclei](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.08488)
    * **Useful**
    * A disadvantage of this model for dynamical studies is that the spatial density distribution that corresponds to this surface brightness profile cannot be written in terms of elementary or regular special functions.
    * We derive a compact and elegant analytical expression for the density of the Nuker model, based the Mellin integral transform method.
    * We extend and refine the classification of spherical isotropic galactic nuclei introduced by Tremaine et al. (1994).

* [Gamma-Ray Burst Host Galaxies: Specific Star Formation Rate vs. Metallicity](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.08511)
    * The observed properties of long gamma-ray burst (GRB) host galaxies show them to often be of a rather low metallicity and/or of high specific star formation rate (SFR).
    * We consider GRB production models dependent on both quantities and show that when compared to the best available data, the respective star formation fractions appear indistinguishable out to redshift of z∼4.

* [Spatially-resolved analysis of neutral winds, stars and ionized gas kinematics with MEGARA/GTC: new insights on the nearby galaxy UGC 10205](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.08556)
    * The high-resolution data show the complexity of the Hα emission line profile revealing the detection of up to three kinematically distinct gaseous components. Despite of this fact, a thin disk model is able to reproduce the bulk of the ionized gas motions in the central regions of UGC 10205.
    * We also report the detection of outflowing neutral gas material blueshifted by ∼ 87 km s−1

* [MUSE-ALMA Halos V: Physical properties and environment of z < 1.4 HI quasar absorbers](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.08699)
    * An ongoing study of the Circum-Galactic Medium (CGM) of low redshift galaxies (z < 1.4), currently comprising 14 strong HI absorbers in five quasar fields.
    * We detect 43 galaxies associated with absorbers down to star formation rate (SFR) limits of 0.01-0.1 solar masses/yr, found within impact parameters (b) of 250 kpc from the quasar sightline.
    * We report a high detection rate of 89 per cent and find that most absorption systems are associated with pairs or groups of galaxies (three to eleven members).
    * We find that groups of associated galaxies follow the canonical relations of N(HI) -- b and W_r(2796) -- b
    * The metallicity of the ISM of associated galaxies, when measured, is higher than the metallicity limits of the absorber. 

* [Tomographic galaxy clustering with the Subaru Hyper Suprime-Cam first year public data release](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.08209)
    * **Important**
    * We select a magnitude limited sample with i<24.5 and analyze it in four redshift bins covering 0.15≲z≲1.5. We carry out a Fourier-space analysis of the two-point clustering of this sample, including all auto- and cross-correlations.
    * Through an HOD analysis, we place constraints on the characteristic halo masses of this sample, finding a good fit up to scales kmax=1Mpc−1
    * We are able to make a ∼3σ detection of lensing magnification in the HSC data. 

* [Turnaround radius of galaxy clusters in N-body simulations](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.08216)

    * 对10^13 Msun以上的Halo：the turnaround radius Rta scales with the enclosed mass Mta as M^1/3, as predicted by the spherical collapse model.
    * Halos exhibit a characteristic average density within the turnaround scale. This characteristic density is dependent on cosmology and redshift.

* [Morphological Star-Galaxy Separation](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.08210)
    * **Relevant**
    * We construct a model of the performance of a star-galaxy separator in a realistic survey to understand the impact of observational signal-to-noise ratio (or equivalently, 5-sigma limiting depth) and seeing on classification performance.
    * The model quantitatively demonstrates that, assuming realistic densities and angular sizes of stars and galaxies, 10% worse seeing can be compensated for by approximately 0.4 magnitudes deeper data to achieve the same star-galaxy classification performance.
    * Because of the significant role that the signal-to-noise ratio plays in resolving small galaxies, surveys with large-aperture telescopes, such as LSST, will continue to see improving star-galaxy separation as they push to these fainter magnitudes.

    * We have compiled a new sample of 465 peculiar velocities from low redshift (z<0.067) Type Ia supernovae.
    * Comparison of the reconstructed peculiar velocity fields to observations allows us to infer the cosmological parameter combination fσ8, and the bulk flow velocity arising from outside the survey volume.

* [Formation of S0s in extreme environments I: clues from kinematics and stellar populations](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.08845)
    * A pilot study of 21 S0 galaxies in extreme environments (field and cluster), and compare their spatially-resolved kinematics and global stellar populations.
    * Kinematics of S0 galaxies in field and cluster are, indeed, different
    * Lenticulars in the cluster are more rotationally supported, suggesting that they are formed through processes that involve the rapid consumption or removal of gas (e.g. starvation, ram pressure stripping). In contrast, S0s in the field are more pressure supported, suggesting that minor mergers served mostly to shape their kinematic properties.

    * We obtained spectra of 65 lensed quasar candidates either with EFOSC2 on the NTT or ESI on Keck, which confirm 10 new gravitationally lensed quasars and 10 quasar pairs with similar spectra, but which do not show a lensing galaxy in DES images.
    * We find a simple cut on the less variable component that retains all confirmed lensed quasars, while removing 94 per cent of contaminant systems with stellar components.

* [Spatial Power Spectra of Dust across the Local Group: No Constraint on Disc Scale Height](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.09459)

    * By forward-modelling the point-spread-function (PSF) on the power spectrum, we find that nearly all power spectra have a single power-law and point source component.w
    * A broken power-law model is only favoured for the LMC 24 μm MIPS power spectrum and is due to intense dust heating in 30 Doradus.

    * We present a first study to empirically validate the existing WFIRST weak lensing requirements flowdown using a suite of 12 matched image simulations, each representing a different perturbation to the wavefront or image motion model. These are chosen to induce a range of potential static and low- and high-frequency time-dependent PSF model errors.

    * 2) the measured velocity widths from the [OIII] emission features and CIV absorption troughs in the same object are similar 
    * 3) the mean radial velocity derived from the BAL outflow is moderately larger than the one from the [OIII] emission outflow.
    * This might imply that BAL quasars and ERQs have the same geometry of outflows or are at a similar evolutionary stage

* [Can UVB variations reconcile simulated quasar absorption lines at high redshift?](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.10151)
    * We introduce variations at z∼ 6 to the UVB and HI self--shielding and explore the sensitivity of the absorption features to modifications of the hardness of the UVB.
    * Observed SiIV and low ionization states (e.g. CII, SiII, OI) are well represented by a soft UV ionizing field at z= 6 but, this same prescription, fails to reproduce the statistical properties of the observed ion CIV absorber population.
    * On the other hand, variations in the HI self--shielding (SSh) prescription leave a non--negligible imprint in the calculated HI column density distribution function (CDDF) at z=4
    * We conclude that small variations in the UVB and HI SSh at z∼ 6 play an important role in improving the estimation of metal ions and HI statistics at this redshift.

* [Detection of missing baryons in galaxy groups with kinetic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.10152)
    * **Interesting**
    * 40000 galaxy group: the detection of the kinetic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect (kSZE) signals from groups of galaxies as a function of halo mass down to log(M500/M⊙)∼12.3
    * The total kSZE flux within halos estimated implies that the gas fraction in halos is about the universal baryon fraction, even in low-mass halos, indicating that the `missing baryons' are found
    * Combined with the thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect, our results indicate that the `missing baryons' associated with galaxy groups are contained in warm-hot media with temperatures between 10^5 and 10^6K.

    * we find that high-redshift galaxies offset towards higher [OIII]/Hb and [NII]/Ha have younger ages and lower metallicity
    * The stellar and nebular metallicities derived for our sample imply that the galaxies offset from the local BPT relation are more alpha-enhanced
    * Even galaxies that are entirely consistent with the local nebular excitation sequence appear to be alpha-enhanced - in contrast with typical local systems

* [Optical continuum photometric reverberation mapping of the Seyfert-1 galaxy Mrk509](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.10319)
    * Specially designed narrow-band filters were used in order to mitigate the line and pseudo-continuum contamination of the signal from the broad line region, while allowing for high-accuracy flux-calibration over a large field of view.
    * The size of the disk is, however, a factor of 1.8 larger than predictions based on the standard thin-disk theory.

* [Lower AGN Abundance in Galaxy Clusters at z < 0.5](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.10342)
    * We investigated AGN fraction in one of the largest samples of X-ray selected clusters from the ROSAT and their immediate surrounding field regions below z <0.5. We found lower average AGN fraction in clusters(2.37+-0.39)% than for the fields (5.12+-0.16)%.
    * We found an increase in the fraction for both cluster and field galaxies with redshift below z < 0.5, which clearly indicates an environment and redshift dependence 
    * We also measured increasing AGN fractions with clustercentric distance for all redshift bins, further confirming the environmental dependence of AGN activities.

* [Mass accretion toward black holes in the final phase of galaxy mergers](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.10621)
    * The mass accretion rate to one SMBH exceeds the Eddington accretion rate when the distance between two black holes (BHs) rapidly decreases. 但只能持续千万年量级，然后就掉到0.1倍爱丁顿吸积率左右
    * The rapid accretion is caused by the angular momentum transfer from the gas to the stellar component, and the moderate accretion in the quasi-steady phase is caused by turbulent viscosity and gravitational torque in the disk.
    * The AGN feedback and the mass accretion to BHs can coexist in the central region of merged galaxies

* [Gaia-assisted discovery of a detached low-ionisation BAL quasar with very large ejection velocities](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.10649)
    * The discovery of a peculiar Broad Absorption Line (BAL) quasar identified in our Gaia-assisted survey of red quasars.
    * However, we observe a weak and spatially-extended emission line at 4450 AA most likely due to Lyman-alpha emission, which implies a systemic redshift of z=2.66 if correctly identified.
    * If this redshift is correct, the quasar is an extreme example of a detached low-ionisation BAL quasar. The BAL lines must originate from material moving with very large velocities ranging from 22000 to 40000 km/s. 
    * To our knowledge, this is the first case of a systemic-redshift measurement based on extended Lyman-α emission for a BAL quasar

    * The majority, 64%±15% and 73%±18%, of the 11 BCGs with observations in CO have lower M(H2)/M⋆ and τdep, respectively, than those estimated for main sequence galaxies.
    * A morphological analysis for a subsample of seven BCGs with archival HST observations reveals that 71%±17% of the BCGs are compact or show star-forming substructures/components.
    * Our results suggest a scenario where distant star forming BCGs assemble a significant fraction ∼16% of their stellar mass in the relatively short timescale τdep, while environmental mechanisms might prevent the replenishment of gas feeding the star formation

* [Balmer Break Galaxy Candidates at z∼6: a Potential View on the Star-Formation Activity at z≳14](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.10954)
    * 通过K-[3.6]颜色找z=6星系中的强Balmer break；as well as by non-detection in X-ray, optical, far-infrared (FIR), and radio bands
    * 3个候选：the BBG candidates at z∼6 have stellar masses of ≈5×10^10M⊙ dominated by old stellar populations with ages of ≳700 Myr.
    * The onset of star formation in the three BBG candidates is expected to be several hundred million years before the observed epoch of z∼6.
    * Our result suggests a smooth evolution of the SFRD beyond z=8.

* [Lyman Continuum Emission Escaping from Green Pea Galaxies at z=0.5](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.10970)
    * We therefore used the HST/COS spectrograph to observe two of the newly discovered i-band excess galaxies around their Lyman limits. One has very strongly detected continuum below its Lyman limit, corresponding to an escape fraction of ionizing photons of 20+/-2%. The other, which is less compact in UV imaging, has a 3-sigma upper limit to its Lyman escape fraction of <5%.

* [A unified framework for X-shaped radio galaxies](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.10494)
    * We propose a radically different picture for X-shaped radio galaxies compared to existing models as transition objects between cold mode accreting low spinning retrograde black holes and low spinning prograde black holes
    * The model explains their smaller average black hole masses, their general aversion for cluster compared to isolated environments, the negligible difference in spectral index between primary and secondary jets despite a time difference in their formation, their absence among the most powerful radio quasars and radio galaxies, and their connection to the elusive FRI quasar class, among others.

* [Three Lyman-alpha emitting galaxies within a quasar proximity zone at z=5.8](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.11486)
    * We demonstrate the utility of this quasar-galaxy synergy by reporting the discovery of the first three `proximate Lyman-α emitters' (LAEs) within the proximity zone of quasar J0836 at z=5.802
    * Aerith A, located behind the quasar with an impact parameter D⊥=278 pkpc, provides the first detection of a Lyman-α transverse proximity effect.
    * Aerith B at a distance D=750 pkpc from the quasar, displays a bright, broad double-peaked Lya emission line.
    * Based on relations calibrated at z≤3, the peak separation implies a low ionizing fesc≲1%, the most direct such constraint on a reionization-era galaxy.

* [The impact of filamentary accretion of subhaloes on the shape and orientation of haloes](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.11647)
    * we quantified the strength of filamentary subhalo accretion for galaxy- and group-sized host haloes by regarding the entry points of subhaloes as filaments and present statistical studies that how the shape and orientation of host haloes at redshift zero correlate with the strength of filamentary subhalo accretion.
    * We confirm previous studies that found the host halo mass dependence of the alignment between orientations of haloes and filaments. We also show that, for the first time, the shape and orientation of haloes weakly correlate with the strength of filamentary subhalo accretion even if the halo masses are the same.
    * Minor-to-major axis ratios of haloes tend to decrease as their filamentary accretion gets stronger.
    * Haloes with highly anisotropic accretion become more spherical or oblate, while haloes with isotropic accretion become more prolate or triaxial.

* [Semi-analytic modeling of AGNs: auto-correlation function and halo occupation](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.11772)
    * The model prediction indicates that this timescale plays a significant role in allowing massive halos to host relatively faint population of AGNs, leading to a higher bias factor for those AGNs.
    * We find that not only the effective halo mass corresponding to the overall bias factor, but the extended shape of the predicted AGN correlation function shows remarkable agreement with those from observations. 
    * Further observational efforts in the near future towards the low luminosity end at redshift ∼1 would give us stronger constraints on the triggering mechanisms of AGN activities through the clustering properties.

* [Repeating fast radio bursts with WSRT/Apertif](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.12217)
    * We aim to detect the first two repeating FRBs: FRB 121102 (R1) and FRB 180814.J0422+73 (R2), and characterise their repeat statistics.
    * We detected 30 bursts from R1. When combined with previous reports, our measurements indicate an increase of 2.7(2) pc cm−3 yr−1 in the dispersion measure along the line of sight. We did not detect any bursts from R2.
