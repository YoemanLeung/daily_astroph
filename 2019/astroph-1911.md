* [COSMIC BIRTH: Efficient Bayesian Inference of the Evolving Cosmic Web from Galaxy Surveys](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.00284)
  * COSMological Initial Conditions from Bayesian Inference Reconstructions with THeoretical models
  * This allows us to map galaxies, observed in a light-cone, to a single high redshift and hereby provide tracers and the corresponding survey completeness in Lagrangian space including phase-space mapping.

* [Phase-space correlation in stellar streams of the Milky Way halo: The clash of Kshir and GD-1](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.00009)
  * Discovery of a 70-degree long stellar stream in the Milky Way halo, which criss-crosses the well known "GD-1" stream 这两个stream距离相近且运动学相关
  * These two streams were accreted onto the Milky Way within the same dark matter sub-halo seems to provide a natural explanation for their phase-space entanglement

* [The Distribution of Ultra-Diffuse and Ultra-Compact Galaxies in the Frontier Fields](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.00011)
