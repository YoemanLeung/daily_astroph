### Nov 5

* [Cosmic Ray Driven Outflows from the Large Magellanic Cloud: Contributions to the LMC Filament](https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.02021)
  * 结合观测的LMC SFH进行的模拟：even for our largest outburst, the mass contribution to the Stream is still quite small, as much of the LMC halo gas is shielded on the LMC's far-side due to the LMC's primarily face-on infall through the Milky Way halo over the past Gyr.
  * On the LMC's near-side, past outflows have fought an uphill battle against ram pressure, with near-side halo mass being at least a factor of a few smaller than the far-side.

* [Blue Galaxies: Modeling Nebular He II Emission in High Redshift Galaxies](https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.02023)
  * 高红移电离发射线模拟不易，主要是因为对局域的光致电离平衡很敏感: driven by a spatially dispersed distribution of stars amidst an inhomogeneous absorbing medium of dust and gas.
  * 存在一些问题：He II λ4686/Hβ ratios in observations of lower-metallicity dwarf galaxies tend to be higher than model predictions
  * These ratios are found to be more sensitive to the presence of 15 Myr or longer gaps in the star formation histories than to extraordinary ionization parameters or specific star formation rates.

* [Abundance and group coalescence timescales of compact groups of galaxies in the EAGLE simulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.02025)
  * CGs的数密度在z=0.2以后演化不大，如果CG中星系并合成一个大星系的时标很短，需要在CG的形成和消失之间有一个平衡
  * 在EAGLE模拟里，很多CG都是因为视线方向的投影造成的
  * In more spherical systems ≈80 per cent of galaxies at z>0.4 merge into one massive galaxy before the simulation end 时标是2-3 Gyr

* [Hα Emission and the Dependence of the Circumgalactic Cool Gas Fraction on Halo Mass](https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.02032)
  * **Important**
  * 用SDSS大量QSO视线方向各种星系看halo里冷气体的电离发射
  * 假设Halo质量和CGM中冷气体比例有一个幂律关系，得到一个经验关系
  * 低质量Halo中 (Mh < 10^10.5 Msun) CGM中冷气体可能占主导，在group和cluster中可能小于5%

* [The impact of quenching on galaxy profiles in the Simba simulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.02041)
  * Simba和MaNGA比较z=0的sSFR profile: Simba shows strong central depressions in star formation rate (SFR), specific SFR, and gas fraction in green valley galaxies and massive star-forming systems 和观测接近，主要来自SMBH的贡献
  * 无论是否加入AGN feedback：Simba yields green valley galaxies with strongly dropping SFR profiles beyond ≳ R50

* [Deciphering the radio-star formation correlation on kpc-scales I. Adaptive kernel smoothing experiments](https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.02253)
  * Within nearby galaxies, variations in the radio-FIR correlation have been observed, mainly because the cosmic ray electrons migrate before they lose their energy via synchrotron emission or escape 通过diffusion和streaming过程

* [Submillimeter signatures from growing supermassive black holes before reionization](https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.02413)
  * Within this model we show that for a sufficiently high mass of gas in a host galaxy – not smaller than the mass of a growing black hole, the cumulative spectrum in the far-infrared reveals a sharp transition from a quasi-blackbody Rayleigh-Jeans spectrum of the black hole ∝ λ−2 to a flat free-free nebular continuum λ 0.118 on longer wavelength limit.

* [Modelling the quenching of star formation activity from the evolution of the colour-magnitude relation in VIPERS](https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.02445)
  * 引入了"bright edge"概念： bright-edge of the colour-magnitude diagram evolves with little dependence on galaxy colour
  * 在Exponential SFH背景下讨论： Among the quenching scenarios explored, the one that best matches the observations assumes that galaxies stop their star formation at a randomly selected time with a uniform distribution up to 2.5 Gyr

* [Revived Fossil Plasma Sources in Galaxy Clusters](https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.02034)
  * 关于之前被射电活动抛如halo中的 fossil relativistic electrons的作用: their radiative life time is only tens of Myrs at GHz frequencies
  * When a pocket of fossil radio plasma is compressed, it boosts the visibility at sub-GHz frequencies, creating so-called radio phoenices 来自于星系团并合或者其他bulk movement的挤压

* [Exploring Effects on Magnifications due to Line-of-Sight Galaxies in the Hubble Frontier Fields](https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.02101)
  * We present the first full set of three-dimensional mass models of the six Hubble Frontier Fields and use them to test for systematic biases in magnifications due to using the traditional 2D approach
  * We find that omitting foreground or background galaxies causes image position offsets between 0.1-0.4”, a non-negligible fraction of the typical 0.3-0.7” residuals

* [Observation and Confirmation of Nine Strong Lensing Systems in Dark Energy Survey Year 1 Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.02162)
  * The sources that we targeted have an i-band surface brightness range of iSB ∼ 22−24 mag/arcsec2 and a spectroscopic redshift range of zspec ∼ 0.8 − 2.6.
  * Lens红移在0.3 < z < 0.7

  * We present 46 lens candidates, of which 3 are previously known. Including 2 additional lenses found by YattaLens, we obtain X-shooter spectra of 6 promising candidates for lens confirmation and redshift measurements.
  * We apply the lens modeling software Glee to model our 6 X-shooter lenses uniformly.

* [Unbiased Differential Size Evolution and the Inside-Out Growth of Galaxies in the Deep CANDELS GOODS Fields at 1≤z≤7](https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.02589)
  * **Relevant**
  * We introduce a novel method of removing foreground objects from distant galaxy (z > 3) images that makes use of the Lyman- break at 912 ̊A, in what we call ‘2-D Lyman-Break Imaging’
  * We measure the redshift-independent Petrosian radius, defined by the parameter η, for each galaxy for three values of η and use this as a proxy for size.
  * We find that the outer radius increases more rapidly, suggesting that as a galaxy grows mass is added to its outer regions via an inside-out growth.

* [The Impact of Starbursts on Element Abundance Ratios](https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.02598)
  * **Useful**
  * Versatile Integrator for Chemical Evolution (VICE), a python package designed to allow flexible descriptions of star formation histories, accretion, and outflow histories and nucleosynthetic yields: http://github.com/giganano/VICE.git
  * Starbursts driven by a temporary boost of gas accretion rate create loops in [O/Fe]-[Fe/H] evolutionary tracks and a peak in the stellar [O/Fe] distribution at intermediate values.

* [Evidence of a population of dark subhalos from Gaia and Pan-STARRS observations of the GD-1 stream](https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.02662)
  * Gaia天体测量加上PanSTARRS测光: A joint analysis of the GD-1 and Pal 5 streams instead requires a population of dark substructures with masses ≈ 10^7 to 10^9 M⊙.
  * 这些小subhalo的质量比例在14%左右，符合CDM下模拟的预测

* [Novel constraints on the particle nature of dark matter from stellar streams](https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.02663)
  * A combined analysis of the density perturbations in the GD-1 and Pal 5 streams leads to a 95% lower limit on the mass of warm dark matter thermal relics mWDM > 4.6 keV; adding dwarf satellite counts strengthens this to mWDM > 6.3 keV.

* [Estimating the molecular gas mass of low-redshift galaxies from a combination of mid-infrared luminosity and optical properties](https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.02795)

* [The impact of the dynamical state of galaxy groups on the stellar populations of central galaxies](https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.02976)
  * **Relevant**
  * 看BGG的magnitude gap以及luminosity offset和星族的关系：BGGs of unrelaxed groups have significantly bluer NUV-r colours than in relaxed groups. This is also true at the fixed sersic index 不能用dust来解释
  * Unrelaxed group中的BGG有更多的非elliptical galaxies，以及有更多的merger

* [Limitations to the "basic" HOD model and beyond](https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.02610)
  * **Important, Study**
  * "Basic" HOD模型：bHOD model underpredicts the real-space correlation function in the TNG300 box by ∼ 15% on scales of 1 Mpc/h < r < 20 Mpc/h
  * 如何通过添加参数来弥补：we find that the local environment of the halo, the velocity dispersion anisotropy, β, and the product of the half-mass radius and the velocity dispersion, σ2Rhalfmass, are the three most effective measures of assembly bias
  * At fixed halo mass, galaxies in one type of environment cluster differently from galaxies in another

* [Dark Energy Survey Year 1 Results: the lensing imprint of cosmic voids on the Cosmic Microwave Background](https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.02951)
  * Cosmic voids gravitationally lens the cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation, re- sulting in a distinct imprint on degree scales
  * we conclude that the previously reported excess integrated Sachs-Wolfe (ISW) signal associated with cosmic voids in DES Y1 has no counterpart in the Planck CMB lensing map.

  * We find that, even for peaks with signal-to-noise ratio larger than 4.0 in weak lensing mass maps constructed in a deep survey with a high source galaxy number density of 30 arcmin−2, derived weak lensing masses for these shear-selected clusters are still biased high by ∼55% on average.

  * We detect a negative metallicity gradient in the outermost halo (r > 35 kpc from the Galactic center)
  * The retrograde stars in the outermost halo exhibit a roughly constant metallicity, which may be linked to the accretion of the Sequoia progenitor.
  * In contrast, prograde stars in the outermost halo exhibit a strong metallicity-distance dependence, indicating that they likely originated from the accretion of galaxies less massive than the Sequoia progenitor galaxy.

* [Measuring lensing ratios with future cosmological surveys](https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.11766)
  * **Study**
  * The ratio between the CMB lensing/galaxy counts and the galaxy shear/galaxy counts cross-correlations combines the information from different cosmological probes to infer cosmographic measurements that are less dependent on astrophysical uncertainties and can constrain the geometry of the Universe.
    * Being a ratio between two cross-correlation terms with the same lens, this estimator is largely independent on the clustering bias of the lens and weak lensing systematics, but depends on most of the background cosmological parameters

* [Fisher for complements: Extracting cosmology and neutrino mass from the counts-in-cells PDF](https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.11158)
  * **Study**
  * The total matter PDF is highly sensitive to the total neutrino mass Mν and can disentangle it from the clustering amplitude σ8.
  * We establish that the matter PDF and the matter power spectrum are highly complementary at mildly nonlinear scales. The matter PDF is particularly powerful for constraining the matter density Ωm, clustering amplitude σ8 and the total neutrino mass Mν.

* [Living with Neighbors. II. Statistical Analysis of Flybys and Mergers of Dark Matter Halos in Cosmological Simulations](https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.10782)
  * The flyby fraction increases by up to a factor of 50 with decreasing halo mass and by up to a factor of 400 with increasing large-scale density, while the merger fraction does not show any significant dependencies on these two parameters
  * The redshift evolution of the flyby fraction is twofold, increasing with redshift at 0<z<1 and remaining constant at z>1, while the merger fraction increases monotonically with redshift at z=0∼4

* [Charge exchange emission and cold clumps in multi-phase galactic outflows](https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.10860)
  * The observed filamentary Hα features are therefore not prime charge-exchange line emitters. They are stripped material torn from the slow moving dense clumps by the faster moving ionised fluid which are subsequently warmed and stretched into elongated shapes.
  * We have shown that some clumps could survive their passage along a galactic outflow. These are advected into the circumgalactic environment, where their remnants would seed condensation of the circumgalactic medium to form new clumps.

* [The ALMaQUEST Survey: III. Scatter in the resolved star forming main sequence is primarily due to variations in star formation efficiency](https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.11887)
  * ALMA+MaNGA: Sigma_SFR is primarily regulated by molecular gas surface density (Sigma_H2) with a secondary dependence on stellar mass surface density (Sigma_*), as expected from an `extended Kennicutt-Schmidt relation'
  * Whilst the absolute rate of star formation is primarily set by the amount of molecular gas, the variation of star formation rate above and below the resolved star forming main sequence (on kpc scales) is primarily due to changes in SFE.

* [Characterising the Structure of Halo Merger Trees Using a Single Parameter: The Tree Entropy](https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.11959)
  * **Interesting, Useful**
  * 用一个参数描述星系的并合树：the "tree entropy", to parametrise the geometry of a halo's entire mass assembly hierarchy, building on a generalisation of Shannon's information entropy.
  * s=0意味着平滑吸积主导，s=1意味着binary并合主导; s的分布：a skewed bell curve peaking near s=0.3 for first generation haloes.
  * We find that s contains a significant amount of information on the morphology of galaxies − in fact more information than the spin, concentration and assembly time of the halo.

* [Gravitational Lens System PS J0147+4630 (Andromeda's Parachute): Main Lensing Galaxy and Optical Variability of the Quasar Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.12123)
  * We report the detection of microlensing variations in C and D as large as ∼0.1 mag on timescales of a few hundred days

* [Beyond Limber: Efficient computation of angular power spectra for galaxy clustering and weak lensing](https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.11947)
  * We present a new method based on our generalized FFTLog algorithm for the efficient computation of angular power spectra beyond the Limber approximation.
  * We find that using the Limber approximation for galaxy clustering in future analyses like LSST Year 1 and DES Year 6 may cause significant biases in cosmological parameters, indicating that going beyond the Limber approximation is necessary for these analyses.

* [SPECULATOR: Emulating stellar population synthesis for fast and accurate galaxy spectra and photometry](https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.11778)
  * **Relevant, Useful**
  * A fast, accurate, and flexible framework for emulating stellar population synthesis (SPS) models for predicting galaxy spectra and photometry
  * For emulating spectra, we use principal component analysis to construct a set of basis functions, and neural networks to learn the basis coefficients as a function of the SPS model parameters. For photometry, we parameterize the magnitudes (for the filters of interest) as a function of SPS parameters by a neural network.

* [Constraints on Neutrino Emission from Nearby Galaxies Using the 2MASS Redshift Survey and IceCube](https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.11809)
  * The distribution of galaxies within the local universe is characterized by anisotropic features. Observatories searching for the production sites of astrophysical neutrinos can take advantage of these features to establish directional correlations between a neutrino dataset and overdensities in the galaxy distribution in the sky.
  * No significant correlations were observed
