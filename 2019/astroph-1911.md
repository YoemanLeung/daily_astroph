* [COSMIC BIRTH: Efficient Bayesian Inference of the Evolving Cosmic Web from Galaxy Surveys](https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.00284)
  * COSMological Initial Conditions from Bayesian Inference Reconstructions with THeoretical models
  * This allows us to map galaxies, observed in a light-cone, to a single high redshift and hereby provide tracers and the corresponding survey completeness in Lagrangian space including phase-space mapping.

* [Phase-space correlation in stellar streams of the Milky Way halo: The clash of Kshir and GD-1](https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.00009)
  * Discovery of a 70-degree long stellar stream in the Milky Way halo, which criss-crosses the well known "GD-1" stream 这两个stream距离相近且运动学相关
  * These two streams were accreted onto the Milky Way within the same dark matter sub-halo seems to provide a natural explanation for their phase-space entanglement

### Nov 5

* [Cosmic Ray Driven Outflows from the Large Magellanic Cloud: Contributions to the LMC Filament](https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.02021)
  * 结合观测的LMC SFH进行的模拟：even for our largest outburst, the mass contribution to the Stream is still quite small, as much of the LMC halo gas is shielded on the LMC's far-side due to the LMC's primarily face-on infall through the Milky Way halo over the past Gyr.
  * On the LMC's near-side, past outflows have fought an uphill battle against ram pressure, with near-side halo mass being at least a factor of a few smaller than the far-side.

* [Blue Galaxies: Modeling Nebular He II Emission in High Redshift Galaxies](https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.02023)
  * 高红移电离发射线模拟不易，主要是因为对局域的光致电离平衡很敏感: driven by a spatially dispersed distribution of stars amidst an inhomogeneous absorbing medium of dust and gas.
  * 存在一些问题：He II λ4686/Hβ ratios in observations of lower-metallicity dwarf galaxies tend to be higher than model predictions
  * These ratios are found to be more sensitive to the presence of 15 Myr or longer gaps in the star formation histories than to extraordinary ionization parameters or specific star formation rates.

* [Abundance and group coalescence timescales of compact groups of galaxies in the EAGLE simulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.02025)
  * CGs的数密度在z=0.2以后演化不大，如果CG中星系并合成一个大星系的时标很短，需要在CG的形成和消失之间有一个平衡
  * 在EAGLE模拟里，很多CG都是因为视线方向的投影造成的
  * In more spherical systems ≈80 per cent of galaxies at z>0.4 merge into one massive galaxy before the simulation end 时标是2-3 Gyr

* [Hα Emission and the Dependence of the Circumgalactic Cool Gas Fraction on Halo Mass](https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.02032)
  * **Important**
  * 用SDSS大量QSO视线方向各种星系看halo里冷气体的电离发射
  * 假设Halo质量和CGM中冷气体比例有一个幂律关系，得到一个经验关系
  * 低质量Halo中 (Mh < 10^10.5 Msun) CGM中冷气体可能占主导，在group和cluster中可能小于5%

* [The impact of quenching on galaxy profiles in the Simba simulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.02041)
  * Simba和MaNGA比较z=0的sSFR profile: Simba shows strong central depressions in star formation rate (SFR), specific SFR, and gas fraction in green valley galaxies and massive star-forming systems 和观测接近，主要来自SMBH的贡献
  * 无论是否加入AGN feedback：Simba yields green valley galaxies with strongly dropping SFR profiles beyond ≳ R50

* [Deciphering the radio-star formation correlation on kpc-scales I. Adaptive kernel smoothing experiments](https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.02253)
