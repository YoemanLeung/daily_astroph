* [ALMA images the many faces of the NGC1068 torus and its surroundings](https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.00675)
  * The torus is connected to the CND through a network of gas streamers. The kinematics of molecular gas show strong departures from circular motions in the torus, the gas streamers, and the CND.
  * We conclude that a wide-angle AGN wind launched from the accretion disk is impacting a sizeable fraction of the gas inside the torus (~0.4-0.6 x M_torus). 但仍有大量气体贮藏未收到AGN影响

* [The space densities and emissivities of AGNs at z>4](https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.00702)

  * MUSE看z=3的QSO pair：eveals filamentary Lyα structures extending between the two quasars
  * 还通过视线方向的吸收气体探测看到了CGM中多成分的证据：The absence of galaxies in the MUSE field of view at the redshifts of these two absorbers suggests that they trace large-scale structures or expanding shells in front of the quasar pair.

* [Local photoionization feedback effects on galaxies](https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.00832)
  * GASOLINE2重新模拟NIHAO中的星系：是否考虑局部光致电离辐射源影响很大

* [Stellar systems following the R1/m luminosity law. IV. The total energy and the central concentration of galaxies](https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.00959)
  * 对Sersic族星系的理论研究，看总能量的表达式：The popular Third Galaxy Concentration index, on the other hand, is shown to be a reliable measure for the intrinsic 3D concentration, even though it is based on the surface brightness distribution and not on the intrinsic 3D density.

* [Quasars Have Fewer Close Companions than Normal Galaxies](https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.00967)
  * 0.3 < z < 3的500多个QSO的HST图像中找周围10-100 kpc内的companion; companion的数密度使用了统计背景星系密度改正
  * Quasars show a 3.7σ deficit of intermediate companions compared to galaxies.

* [Bar pattern speeds in CALIFA galaxies II. The case of weakly barred galaxies](https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.01023)
  * 不少所谓的弱棒星系其实中心并没有刚体旋转的棒成分
  * 真的弱棒星系的棒长度短，公转半径小;弱棒和强棒星系的棒的图样速度差不多，且两类星系的bulge性质没有明显差别

* [Disc galaxies formed from major mergers in Illustris](https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.01033)
  * 在Illustris里，wet major merger后缓慢形成的年轻恒星可以重建出盘星系
  * 并合里会有气体被抛射到halo里，随后回落并形成恒星; 气体比例是在并和后重建盘的关键

  * 在SDSS里，有SF的Elliptical星系的气体丰度和Spiral明显不同，丰度偏低，可能主要来自minor merger带来的气体

* [Dense gas formation and destruction in a simulated Perseus-like galaxy cluster with spin-driven black hole feedback](https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.01329)
  * We show that the formation and destruction of dense gas is closely linked to the SMBH's feedback cycle, and that its morphology is highly variable throughout the simulation
  * While extended filamentary structures readily condense from the hot intra-cluster medium, they are easily shattered into an overly clumpy distribution of gas during their interaction with the jet driven outflows.

* [Constraining the properties of gaseous halos via cross-correlations of upcoming galaxy surveys and thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich maps](https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.00405)

  * 12个盘星系中AGN的外流的窄带观测：10个能定出外流速率，比吸积率要高；要支持这样的黑洞吸积，可以通过bar，spiral arm这样的久期过程实现
  * 和一些在merger中的AGN外流比，这些盘星系的黑洞吸积率更高，外流率更低

* [The hidden satellites of massive galaxies and quasars at high-redshift](https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.01360)
  * **Interesting**
  * 模拟中看一个高红移罕见的大质量Halo中卫星的性质：对Feedback和Tidal forces敏感
  * 在有超新星爆发前Radiative feedback就可以起作用，降低星系的束缚程度：让卫星更容易被瓦解，能更快地被吸积进main progenitor; 卫星数量也会随之降低

  * We propose that the observed chemical variation or lack of it is due to the presence or absence of collision-induced evolution of molecular clouds and induced star formation

* [Global Attenuation in Spiral Galaxies in Optical and Infrared Band](https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.01572)
  * 看盘星系消光和星系什么性质有关：消光在质量较大，金属丰度高，且仍有显著金属贮藏的星系里最高
  * We determine both a parametric model for dust obscuration and a non-parametric model based on the Gaussian process formalism

* [From the Outside Looking in: What can Milky Way Analogues Tell us About the Star Formation Rate of Our Own Galaxy?](https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.01654)

  * MaNGA中不同类型的PSB：31 galaxies with central post-starburst regions (CPSB), 37 galaxies with off-center ring-like post-starburst regions (RPSB) and 292 galaxies with irregular post-starburst regions (IPSB)
  * The radial profiles in mass-weighted age and stellar v/σ indicate that CPSBs and RPSBs are not simply different evolutionary stages of the same event, rather that CPSB galaxies are caused by a significant disruptive event

* [The Formation of Ultra-Diffuse Galaxies in Clusters](https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.01347)
  * **Relevant**
  * IllustrisTNG模拟：The model assumes "cuspy" NFW halos and, contrary to recent claims, has no difficulty reproducing the observed number of UDGs in clusters.
  * UDG包含了在field里面形成的正常的LSB星系，以及一部分在cluster里面受到潮汐作用影响的；后者的分布更集中在cluster中心；在相同质量上，后者比前者的速度弥散度更低，金属丰度更高，DM比例更低

  * The electron density of the SMG is similar to that of the Galactic Plane and to the average of the local spirals.
  * 为什么[NII]线重要：the two [NII] fine-structure lines originate from fully ionized gas since the ionization potential of nitrogen (14.5 eV) is about ∼ 0.9 eV higher than that of hydrogen. 反映了能够电离H的高能光子的来源，可能是年轻大质量恒星，也可能是X-ray光致离解区
