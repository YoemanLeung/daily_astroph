  * Investigate the possible presence of neutral hydrogen (HI) in intergalactic filaments at very low redshift (z∼0.08), by stacking a set of 274,712 2dFGRS galaxy pairs over 21-cm maps 
  * Our study does not reveal any clear HI excess in the considered filaments in either case; we determine upper limits on the total filament HI brightness temperature at Tb≲10.3μK for the 10-mode and at Tb≲4.8μK for the 20-mode removed maps at the 95% confidence level. 
  * Column density constraints are consistent with previous detections of HI in the warm-hot intergalactic medium obtained observing broad Ly α absorption systems

* [Cluster counts : Tensions, massive neutrinos, and modified gravity. III](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.00163)
  * 看能不能通过 massive neutrinos and a simple modified gravity model via a non-standard growth index γ 让LCDM预测的SZ Cluster数量符合观测
  * massive neutrinos do not alleviate the cluster-CMB tension
  * When both massive neutrinos and modified gravity are allowed, preferred values remain centred on standard ΛCDM values but (1−b)∼0.8 is allowed (though only at the 2σ level) provided mν∼0.34 eV and γ∼0.8.

* [Is There a Fundamental Upper Limit to the Mass of a Star Cluster?](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.00550)
  * We compile a comprehensive catalog of compact stellar systems, and reinforce the evidence that the true ancient star cluster population has a maximum mass of M⋆ ~ 5×10^7 M⊙, corresponding to a stellar mass at birth of close to 10^8 M⊙.
