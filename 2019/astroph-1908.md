  * Investigate the possible presence of neutral hydrogen (HI) in intergalactic filaments at very low redshift (z∼0.08), by stacking a set of 274,712 2dFGRS galaxy pairs over 21-cm maps 
  * Our study does not reveal any clear HI excess in the considered filaments in either case; we determine upper limits on the total filament HI brightness temperature at Tb≲10.3μK for the 10-mode and at Tb≲4.8μK for the 20-mode removed maps at the 95% confidence level. 
  * Column density constraints are consistent with previous detections of HI in the warm-hot intergalactic medium obtained observing broad Ly α absorption systems

  * 看能不能通过 massive neutrinos and a simple modified gravity model via a non-standard growth index γ 让LCDM预测的SZ Cluster数量符合观测
  * massive neutrinos do not alleviate the cluster-CMB tension
  * When both massive neutrinos and modified gravity are allowed, preferred values remain centred on standard ΛCDM values but (1−b)∼0.8 is allowed (though only at the 2σ level) provided mν∼0.34 eV and γ∼0.8.

* [Is There a Fundamental Upper Limit to the Mass of a Star Cluster?](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.00550)

### Aug 5

* [Consistent Calibration of the Tip of the Red Giant Branch in the Large Magellanic Cloud on the Hubble Space Telescope Photometric System and Implications for the Determination of the Hubble Constant](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.00993)
  * We show that measurements of the TRGB in the LMC and in the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) based on these surveys are biased (too bright) by up to ∼0.1 mag in the optical due to blending, and that the bias is a function of local stellar density.
  * The ground-toHST correction enables us to place the LMC TRGB zeropoint on the ACS F814W system, which is commonly used for extragalactic calibrations, while benefiting from the large sample of TRGB stars from ground-based observations.

* [Complex molecular gas kinematics in the inner 5 kpc of 4C12.50 as seen by ALMA](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.01011)
  * 红外星系，富气体并合，有射电活动：The radio emission at small (∼100 pc) and large (∼100 kpc) scales, as well as the large X-ray cavity in which the system is embedded, are indicative of a jet that could have affected the ISM.
  * ALMA观测：The CO emission reveals the presence of gaseous streams related to the merger, which result in a small (∼4kpc-wide) disk around the western nucleus.
  * Wind的速度很快，其中的气体质量可能在10^9 Msun量级：Energetically, it is possible that the jet, assisted by the radiation pressure of the active nucleus or the stars, accelerated clouds inside an expanding bubble

* [Photometric and Kinematic Misalignments and Their Evolution Among Fast and Slow Rotators in the Illustris Simulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.01102)
  * **Interesting**
  * 还是Illustris: Our results for the projections of galaxies display clear trends of an overall increase of kinematic misalignment and a slight decrease of ellipticity for fast rotators with increasing masses 
  * It is also found that the number of very slow rotators with large ellipticities is much larger than found in observations.
  * triaxiality and intrinsic flatness in general decrease with time, however, sometimes increases occur that are clearly seen to correlate with major merger events.
