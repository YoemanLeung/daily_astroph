* [Correlations Between Black Holes and Host Galaxies in the Illustris and IllustrisTNG Simulations](https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.00017)
  * The relation between MBH and stellar mass M∗ is tighter than the observations, especially for TNG100.
  * For TNG100, the correlation between SMBH over-massiveness and star formation history is much weaker

* [The Next Generation Virgo Cluster Survey. XVII. A Search for Planetary Nebulae in Virgo Cluster Globular Clusters](https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.00169)
  * We report a systematic spectroscopic survey for the [Oiii] 5007AA emission line of PNe in 1469 Virgo GCs and 121 Virgo ultra-compact dwarfs (UCDs)
  * UCD中没有看到PNe，GC中看到了一个; 可能PNe的specific frequency随光度下降，同时还有选择效应：只有最亮的GC会被看到

* [Circumventing Lens Modeling to Detect Dark Matter Substructure in Strong Lens Images with Convolutional Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.00015)
  * CNN模型在SL图像中找substructure： For images with a single perturber, the network is able to infer their presence when they have masses as low as 10^9 Msun. 
  * 如果subhalo数量更多，则CNN的准确度要高得多

* [Radiation-driven outflows in AGNs: Revisiting feedback effects of scattered and reprocessed photons](https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.00288)
  * SMBH周围缓慢旋转吸积流的二维模拟；包含了：“re-radiation”, i.e., the locally produced radiation by Thomson scattering, line and bremsstrahlung radiation
  * 当考虑了X-ray光子的Thomson散射后，AGN外流rate和外流速度，以及光度都能提高
