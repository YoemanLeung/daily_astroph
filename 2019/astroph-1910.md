### Oct 1

* [Correlations Between Black Holes and Host Galaxies in the Illustris and IllustrisTNG Simulations](https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.00017)
  * The relation between MBH and stellar mass M∗ is tighter than the observations, especially for TNG100.
  * For TNG100, the correlation between SMBH over-massiveness and star formation history is much weaker

* [The Next Generation Virgo Cluster Survey. XVII. A Search for Planetary Nebulae in Virgo Cluster Globular Clusters](https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.00169)
  * We report a systematic spectroscopic survey for the [Oiii] 5007AA emission line of PNe in 1469 Virgo GCs and 121 Virgo ultra-compact dwarfs (UCDs)
  * UCD中没有看到PNe，GC中看到了一个; 可能PNe的specific frequency随光度下降，同时还有选择效应：只有最亮的GC会被看到

* [Circumventing Lens Modeling to Detect Dark Matter Substructure in Strong Lens Images with Convolutional Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.00015)
  * CNN模型在SL图像中找substructure： For images with a single perturber, the network is able to infer their presence when they have masses as low as 10^9 Msun.
  * 如果subhalo数量更多，则CNN的准确度要高得多

* [Radiation-driven outflows in AGNs: Revisiting feedback effects of scattered and reprocessed photons](https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.00288)
  * SMBH周围缓慢旋转吸积流的二维模拟；包含了：“re-radiation”, i.e., the locally produced radiation by Thomson scattering, line and bremsstrahlung radiation
  * 当考虑了X-ray光子的Thomson散射后，AGN外流rate和外流速度，以及光度都能提高

### Oct 2

* [Variations in the width, density, and direction of the Palomar 5 tidal tails](https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.00592)
  * (1) a wide, low surface-brightness extension of the leading tail; (2) significant density variations along the stream; and (3) sharp changes in the direction of both the leading and the trailing tail.
  * 银河系bar的旋转产生的扰动可以解释部分，但有些特征解释不了，需要额外的扰动

* [The resolved size and structure of hot dust in the immediate vicinity of AGN](https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.00593)
  * 8个TypeI AGN的观测：We partially resolve each source, and report Gaussian FWHM sizes in the range 0.3-0.8 milliarcseconds.
  * We find no evidence for significant elongation or asymmetry (closure phases < 1 deg).
  * 物理大小随着AGN光度增加；Seyfert的size比QSO要大

* [Cosmological baryon transfer in the SIMBA simulations](https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.00594)
  * 看在模拟里，重子物质相对暗物质travel多远：spread metric which quantifies the distance in the final conditions between initially neighbouring particles
  * 40% (10%) of cosmological baryons have moved >1h−1 Mpc−1 (3h−1 Mpc−1) by z=0, due primarily to entrainment of gas by jets powered by AGN
  * Only 60% of the gas content in a given halo at z=0 originates from its Lagrangian region

* [The Mass-Metallicity and the Fundamental Metallicity Relation revisited on a fully Te-based abundance scale for galaxies](https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.00597)
  * The slope and saturation metallicity are in good agreement with previous determinations of the MZR based on the Te method, while showing significantly lower normalisation compared to those based on photoionisation models.
  * A new parametrisation of the FMR is given by explicitly introducing the SFR-dependence of the turnover mass into the MZR.

* [Parsec-scale Dusty Winds in Active Galactic Nuclei: Evidence for Radiation Pressure Driving](https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.00600)
  * We tentatively conclude that there is more dust in the wind at higher Eddington ratios, at least in type 2 AGN where such an effect is expected to be more easily visible.

* [A Cepheid-Based Distance to the Seyfert Galaxy NGC 6814](https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.00666)
  * HST观测：90 excellent Cepheid candidates spanning a range of periods of 13−84 days.
  * Gives a distance of 21.65±0.41 Mpc to NGC 6814.

* [Two major accretion epochs in M31 from two distinct populations of globular clusters](https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.00808)
  * We find that the two distinct populations are rotating with perpendicular orientations. The rotation axis for the population associated with the smooth halo is aligned with the rotation axis for the plane of dwarf galaxies that encircles M31.

* [Medium-band Photometry Reverberation Mapping of Nearby Active Galactic Nuclei](https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.01061)
  * 用中带监测代替RM观测中的光谱观测。As the widths of medium-band filters match well with the widths of AGN broad emission lines, the medium-band observation with small telescopes can be a cost-effective way to perform RM

### Oct 3

* [An ALMA survey of the SCUBA-2 Cosmology Legacy Survey UKIDSS/UDS field: High-resolution dust continuum morphologies and the link between sub-millimetre galaxies and spheroid formation](https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.00592)
  * FIR面亮度轮廓和exp盘类似，轴比分布符合三轴椭球：we suggest that the bulk of the 870 µm dust continuum emission in the central ∼ 2 kpc of these galaxies arises from bar-like structures
  * By stacking our 870 µm maps we recover faint extended dust continuum emission on ∼ 4 kpc scales which contributes 13 ± 1% of the total 870 µm emission
  * 平均大小在1.2 kpc左右

* [The Fates of the Circumgalactic Medium in the FIRE Simulations](https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.01123)
  * FIRE模拟21个zoom-in halo，10^12 Msun的halo里，z=2的CGM在z=0的时候50%都进入了ISM和星系
  * Low-mass halo中的CGM大部分都进入了IGM; 但大部分是先进入了星系，然后被eject出去的
  * 高红移的气体多数是cold的，低红移则多数是hot的；但是cold的气体在高红移和低红移都会进入星系
  * We find that the metallicity of CGM gas is typically a poor predictor of both its proximate and ultimate fates

* [Spatially resolved signature of quenching in star-forming galaxies](https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.01130)
  * 利用低[O iii]/Hα找recently quenched galaxies，和对照样本比较
  * The radial profile of gas-phase metallicity of the two samples have a similar slope and normalisation.

* [Lensed quasar search via time variability with the HSC transient survey](https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.01140)
  * Using difference images from multiple epochs, our lens search algorithm achieves a high true-positive rate (TPR) of 90.1% and a low false-positive rate (FPR) of 2.3% for the bright quads (the third brightest image brightness m3rd < 22.0 mag) with wide separation (the largest separation among the multiple image pairs θLP > 1.5 00).

* [Gas filaments of the cosmic web located around active galaxies in a proto-cluster](https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.01324)
  * We report the detection of rest-frame ultraviolet Lyman-α radiation from multiple filaments extending more than one megaparsec between galaxies within the SSA 22 proto-cluster at a redshift of 3.1
  * Our observations map the gas in filamentary structures of the type thought to fuel the growth of galaxies and black holes in massive proto-clusters.

* [The SAMI Galaxy Survey: rules of behaviour for spin-ellipticity radial tracks in galaxies](https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.01358)
  * **Interesting**
  * We find the use of spin-ellipticity radial tracks is valuable in identifying substructures within a galaxy, including embedded and counter-rotating discs
  * The density of information presented through spin-ellipticity radial tracks emphasises a clear advantage to representing galaxies as a track, rather than a single point, in spin-ellipticity parameter space.

* [To TDE or not to TDE: The luminous transient ASASSN-18jd with TDE-like and AGN-like qualities](https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.01142)
  * While ASASSN-18jd shares similarities with Tidal Disruption Events (TDEs), it is also similar to the “rapid turn-on” events seen in quiescent galaxies and in faint Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs).

### Oct 6

* [Constraining Star Formation Histories of Blue Galaxies using the Scatter between Stellar Mass and Halo Mass](https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.01644)
  * **Relevant**
  * we present flexible models that track the star formation, stellar mass, and host halo accretion histories of SF central galaxies at z < 1 while reproducing the observed stellar mass function and SFS
  * 在Mh=10^12 Msun处的SHMR scatter对SF变化的时标很敏感：时标越短，SHMR越紧致
  * 目前的主要限制是在z=1处，10^12Msun的halo处的SHMR的scatter没有很好的限制

* [A few StePS forward in unveiling the complexity of galaxy evolution: light-weighted stellar ages of intermediate redshift galaxies with WEAVE](https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.01644)
  * **Relevant**
  * 模拟StePS巡天观测的星系光谱，看能否准确测量各种UV和光学谱指数: We find that the ultraviolet indices significantly narrow the uncertainties in estimating the r- and u-band light-weighted ages and their difference in individual galaxies
  * The difference between r-band and u-band light-weighted ages is shown to be a powerful diagnostic to characterize and constrain extended star-formation histories and the presence of young stellar populations on top of older ones

* [RedMaPPer: Evolution and Mass Dependence of the Conditional Luminosity Functions of Red Galaxies in Galaxy Clusters](https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.01656)
  * **Interesting, Relevant**
  * Using a larger galaxy cluster sample than previously employed in the literature, we find that the luminosities of central galaxies scale as ⟨logL⟩∝ALlog(M200b), with AL=0.39±0.04; 在固定M200b上的scatter是0.23dex
  * A positive correlation between the luminosity of central galaxies and the observed richness of clusters at a fixed halo mass
  * We estimate the fraction of galaxy clusters where the brightest galaxy is not the central to be PBNC∼20%

* [The inner view of NGC 1052 using multiple X-ray observations](https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.01660)
  * We found a wavelength-dependent calibration issue between simultaneous XMM -Newton and NuSTAR spectra.
  * We also find that a patchyabsober can explain the behaviour of this source better as it is ∼ 200 times more likely than the uniform absober

* [Merger induced clump formation in distant infrared luminous starburst galaxies](https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.01661)
  * we measure the fraction of clumpy emission in 109 main sequence (MS) and 79 Herschel-detected starbursts (off-MS) galaxies at 0.5 < z < 0.9 发现并合也可以成为形成stellar clump的主要渠道之一
  * We confirm the merger induced clumpiness enhancement with novel hydrodynamical simulations of colliding galaxies with gas fractions typical of z ∼ 0.7.
  * we find that the clumpiness is mildly anti-correlated with the merger phase, decreasing towards final coalescence

* [Sensitivity analysis of a galaxy formation model](https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.01745)
  * **Interesting**
  * A variance-based sensitivity analysis (SA): 看K波段光度函数对GALFORM SAM里面的哪些参数敏感
  * We then use SA to compute Sobol’ sensitivity indices varying seven model parameters, connecting the variance in the model output to the variance in the input parameters

* [Astroinformatics based search for globular clusters in the Fornax Deep Survey](https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.01884)
  * We use a Neural-Gas model, a pure clustering machine learning methodology, to approach the GC detection, while a novel feature selection method (ΦLAB) is exploited to perform the parameter space analysis and optimization.
