### Oct 1

* [Correlations Between Black Holes and Host Galaxies in the Illustris and IllustrisTNG Simulations](https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.00017)
  * The relation between MBH and stellar mass M∗ is tighter than the observations, especially for TNG100.
  * For TNG100, the correlation between SMBH over-massiveness and star formation history is much weaker

* [The Next Generation Virgo Cluster Survey. XVII. A Search for Planetary Nebulae in Virgo Cluster Globular Clusters](https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.00169)
  * We report a systematic spectroscopic survey for the [Oiii] 5007AA emission line of PNe in 1469 Virgo GCs and 121 Virgo ultra-compact dwarfs (UCDs)
  * UCD中没有看到PNe，GC中看到了一个; 可能PNe的specific frequency随光度下降，同时还有选择效应：只有最亮的GC会被看到

* [Circumventing Lens Modeling to Detect Dark Matter Substructure in Strong Lens Images with Convolutional Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.00015)
  * CNN模型在SL图像中找substructure： For images with a single perturber, the network is able to infer their presence when they have masses as low as 10^9 Msun. 
  * 如果subhalo数量更多，则CNN的准确度要高得多

* [Radiation-driven outflows in AGNs: Revisiting feedback effects of scattered and reprocessed photons](https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.00288)
  * SMBH周围缓慢旋转吸积流的二维模拟；包含了：“re-radiation”, i.e., the locally produced radiation by Thomson scattering, line and bremsstrahlung radiation
  * 当考虑了X-ray光子的Thomson散射后，AGN外流rate和外流速度，以及光度都能提高

* [Variations in the width, density, and direction of the Palomar 5 tidal tails](https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.00592)
  * (1) a wide, low surface-brightness extension of the leading tail; (2) significant density variations along the stream; and (3) sharp changes in the direction of both the leading and the trailing tail. 
  * 银河系bar的旋转产生的扰动可以解释部分，但有些特征解释不了，需要额外的扰动

* [The resolved size and structure of hot dust in the immediate vicinity of AGN](https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.00593)
  * 8个TypeI AGN的观测：We partially resolve each source, and report Gaussian FWHM sizes in the range 0.3-0.8 milliarcseconds.
  * We find no evidence for significant elongation or asymmetry (closure phases < 1 deg). 
  * 物理大小随着AGN光度增加；Seyfert的size比QSO要大

* [Cosmological baryon transfer in the SIMBA simulations](https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.00594)
  * 看在模拟里，重子物质相对暗物质travel多远：spread metric which quantifies the distance in the final conditions between initially neighbouring particles
  * 40% (10%) of cosmological baryons have moved >1h−1 Mpc−1 (3h−1 Mpc−1) by z=0, due primarily to entrainment of gas by jets powered by AGN
  * Only 60% of the gas content in a given halo at z=0 originates from its Lagrangian region

* [The Mass-Metallicity and the Fundamental Metallicity Relation revisited on a fully Te-based abundance scale for galaxies](https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.00597)
  * The slope and saturation metallicity are in good agreement with previous determinations of the MZR based on the Te method, while showing significantly lower normalisation compared to those based on photoionisation models.
  * A new parametrisation of the FMR is given by explicitly introducing the SFR-dependence of the turnover mass into the MZR. T

* [Parsec-scale Dusty Winds in Active Galactic Nuclei: Evidence for Radiation Pressure Driving](https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.00600)

* [A Cepheid-Based Distance to the Seyfert Galaxy NGC 6814](https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.00666)
  * HST观测：90 excellent Cepheid candidates spanning a range of periods of 13−84 days.
  * Gives a distance of 21.65±0.41 Mpc to NGC 6814. 

* [Two major accretion epochs in M31 from two distinct populations of globular clusters](https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.00808)
  * We find that the two distinct populations are rotating with perpendicular orientations. The rotation axis for the population associated with the smooth halo is aligned with the rotation axis for the plane of dwarf galaxies that encircles M31.

* [Medium-band Photometry Reverberation Mapping of Nearby Active Galactic Nuclei](https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.01061)
  * 用中带监测代替RM观测中的光谱观测。As the widths of medium-band filters match well with the widths of AGN broad emission lines, the medium-band observation with small telescopes can be a cost-effective way to perform RM
