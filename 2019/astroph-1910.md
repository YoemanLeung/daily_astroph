### Oct 1

* [Correlations Between Black Holes and Host Galaxies in the Illustris and IllustrisTNG Simulations](https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.00017)
  * The relation between MBH and stellar mass M∗ is tighter than the observations, especially for TNG100.
  * For TNG100, the correlation between SMBH over-massiveness and star formation history is much weaker

* [The Next Generation Virgo Cluster Survey. XVII. A Search for Planetary Nebulae in Virgo Cluster Globular Clusters](https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.00169)
  * We report a systematic spectroscopic survey for the [Oiii] 5007AA emission line of PNe in 1469 Virgo GCs and 121 Virgo ultra-compact dwarfs (UCDs)
  * UCD中没有看到PNe，GC中看到了一个; 可能PNe的specific frequency随光度下降，同时还有选择效应：只有最亮的GC会被看到

* [Circumventing Lens Modeling to Detect Dark Matter Substructure in Strong Lens Images with Convolutional Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.00015)
  * CNN模型在SL图像中找substructure： For images with a single perturber, the network is able to infer their presence when they have masses as low as 10^9 Msun.
  * 如果subhalo数量更多，则CNN的准确度要高得多

* [Radiation-driven outflows in AGNs: Revisiting feedback effects of scattered and reprocessed photons](https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.00288)
  * SMBH周围缓慢旋转吸积流的二维模拟；包含了：“re-radiation”, i.e., the locally produced radiation by Thomson scattering, line and bremsstrahlung radiation
  * 当考虑了X-ray光子的Thomson散射后，AGN外流rate和外流速度，以及光度都能提高

### Oct 2

* [Variations in the width, density, and direction of the Palomar 5 tidal tails](https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.00592)
  * (1) a wide, low surface-brightness extension of the leading tail; (2) significant density variations along the stream; and (3) sharp changes in the direction of both the leading and the trailing tail.
  * 银河系bar的旋转产生的扰动可以解释部分，但有些特征解释不了，需要额外的扰动

* [The resolved size and structure of hot dust in the immediate vicinity of AGN](https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.00593)
  * 8个TypeI AGN的观测：We partially resolve each source, and report Gaussian FWHM sizes in the range 0.3-0.8 milliarcseconds.
  * We find no evidence for significant elongation or asymmetry (closure phases < 1 deg).
  * 物理大小随着AGN光度增加；Seyfert的size比QSO要大

* [Cosmological baryon transfer in the SIMBA simulations](https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.00594)
  * 看在模拟里，重子物质相对暗物质travel多远：spread metric which quantifies the distance in the final conditions between initially neighbouring particles
  * 40% (10%) of cosmological baryons have moved >1h−1 Mpc−1 (3h−1 Mpc−1) by z=0, due primarily to entrainment of gas by jets powered by AGN
  * Only 60% of the gas content in a given halo at z=0 originates from its Lagrangian region

* [The Mass-Metallicity and the Fundamental Metallicity Relation revisited on a fully Te-based abundance scale for galaxies](https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.00597)
  * The slope and saturation metallicity are in good agreement with previous determinations of the MZR based on the Te method, while showing significantly lower normalisation compared to those based on photoionisation models.
  * A new parametrisation of the FMR is given by explicitly introducing the SFR-dependence of the turnover mass into the MZR.

* [Parsec-scale Dusty Winds in Active Galactic Nuclei: Evidence for Radiation Pressure Driving](https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.00600)
  * We tentatively conclude that there is more dust in the wind at higher Eddington ratios, at least in type 2 AGN where such an effect is expected to be more easily visible.

* [A Cepheid-Based Distance to the Seyfert Galaxy NGC 6814](https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.00666)
  * HST观测：90 excellent Cepheid candidates spanning a range of periods of 13−84 days.
  * Gives a distance of 21.65±0.41 Mpc to NGC 6814.

* [Two major accretion epochs in M31 from two distinct populations of globular clusters](https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.00808)
  * We find that the two distinct populations are rotating with perpendicular orientations. The rotation axis for the population associated with the smooth halo is aligned with the rotation axis for the plane of dwarf galaxies that encircles M31.

* [Medium-band Photometry Reverberation Mapping of Nearby Active Galactic Nuclei](https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.01061)
  * 用中带监测代替RM观测中的光谱观测。As the widths of medium-band filters match well with the widths of AGN broad emission lines, the medium-band observation with small telescopes can be a cost-effective way to perform RM

### Oct 3

* [An ALMA survey of the SCUBA-2 Cosmology Legacy Survey UKIDSS/UDS field: High-resolution dust continuum morphologies and the link between sub-millimetre galaxies and spheroid formation](https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.00592)
  * FIR面亮度轮廓和exp盘类似，轴比分布符合三轴椭球：we suggest that the bulk of the 870 µm dust continuum emission in the central ∼ 2 kpc of these galaxies arises from bar-like structures
  * By stacking our 870 µm maps we recover faint extended dust continuum emission on ∼ 4 kpc scales which contributes 13 ± 1% of the total 870 µm emission
  * 平均大小在1.2 kpc左右

* [The Fates of the Circumgalactic Medium in the FIRE Simulations](https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.01123)
  * FIRE模拟21个zoom-in halo，10^12 Msun的halo里，z=2的CGM在z=0的时候50%都进入了ISM和星系
  * Low-mass halo中的CGM大部分都进入了IGM; 但大部分是先进入了星系，然后被eject出去的
  * 高红移的气体多数是cold的，低红移则多数是hot的；但是cold的气体在高红移和低红移都会进入星系
  * We find that the metallicity of CGM gas is typically a poor predictor of both its proximate and ultimate fates

* [Spatially resolved signature of quenching in star-forming galaxies](https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.01130)
  * 利用低[O iii]/Hα找recently quenched galaxies，和对照样本比较
  * The radial profile of gas-phase metallicity of the two samples have a similar slope and normalisation.

* [Lensed quasar search via time variability with the HSC transient survey](https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.01140)
  * Using difference images from multiple epochs, our lens search algorithm achieves a high true-positive rate (TPR) of 90.1% and a low false-positive rate (FPR) of 2.3% for the bright quads (the third brightest image brightness m3rd < 22.0 mag) with wide separation (the largest separation among the multiple image pairs θLP > 1.5 00).

* [Gas filaments of the cosmic web located around active galaxies in a proto-cluster](https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.01324)
  * We report the detection of rest-frame ultraviolet Lyman-α radiation from multiple filaments extending more than one megaparsec between galaxies within the SSA 22 proto-cluster at a redshift of 3.1
  * Our observations map the gas in filamentary structures of the type thought to fuel the growth of galaxies and black holes in massive proto-clusters.

* [The SAMI Galaxy Survey: rules of behaviour for spin-ellipticity radial tracks in galaxies](https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.01358)
  * **Interesting**
  * We find the use of spin-ellipticity radial tracks is valuable in identifying substructures within a galaxy, including embedded and counter-rotating discs
  * The density of information presented through spin-ellipticity radial tracks emphasises a clear advantage to representing galaxies as a track, rather than a single point, in spin-ellipticity parameter space.

* [To TDE or not to TDE: The luminous transient ASASSN-18jd with TDE-like and AGN-like qualities](https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.01142)
  * While ASASSN-18jd shares similarities with Tidal Disruption Events (TDEs), it is also similar to the “rapid turn-on” events seen in quiescent galaxies and in faint Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs).

### Oct 6

* [Constraining Star Formation Histories of Blue Galaxies using the Scatter between Stellar Mass and Halo Mass](https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.01644)
  * **Relevant**
  * we present flexible models that track the star formation, stellar mass, and host halo accretion histories of SF central galaxies at z < 1 while reproducing the observed stellar mass function and SFS
  * 在Mh=10^12 Msun处的SHMR scatter对SF变化的时标很敏感：时标越短，SHMR越紧致
  * 目前的主要限制是在z=1处，10^12Msun的halo处的SHMR的scatter没有很好的限制

* [A few StePS forward in unveiling the complexity of galaxy evolution: light-weighted stellar ages of intermediate redshift galaxies with WEAVE](https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.01644)
  * **Relevant**
  * 模拟StePS巡天观测的星系光谱，看能否准确测量各种UV和光学谱指数: We find that the ultraviolet indices significantly narrow the uncertainties in estimating the r- and u-band light-weighted ages and their difference in individual galaxies
  * The difference between r-band and u-band light-weighted ages is shown to be a powerful diagnostic to characterize and constrain extended star-formation histories and the presence of young stellar populations on top of older ones

* [RedMaPPer: Evolution and Mass Dependence of the Conditional Luminosity Functions of Red Galaxies in Galaxy Clusters](https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.01656)
  * **Interesting, Relevant**
  * Using a larger galaxy cluster sample than previously employed in the literature, we find that the luminosities of central galaxies scale as ⟨logL⟩∝ALlog(M200b), with AL=0.39±0.04; 在固定M200b上的scatter是0.23dex
  * A positive correlation between the luminosity of central galaxies and the observed richness of clusters at a fixed halo mass
  * We estimate the fraction of galaxy clusters where the brightest galaxy is not the central to be PBNC∼20%

* [The inner view of NGC 1052 using multiple X-ray observations](https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.01660)
  * We found a wavelength-dependent calibration issue between simultaneous XMM -Newton and NuSTAR spectra.
  * We also find that a patchyabsober can explain the behaviour of this source better as it is ∼ 200 times more likely than the uniform absober

* [Merger induced clump formation in distant infrared luminous starburst galaxies](https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.01661)
  * we measure the fraction of clumpy emission in 109 main sequence (MS) and 79 Herschel-detected starbursts (off-MS) galaxies at 0.5 < z < 0.9 发现并合也可以成为形成stellar clump的主要渠道之一
  * We confirm the merger induced clumpiness enhancement with novel hydrodynamical simulations of colliding galaxies with gas fractions typical of z ∼ 0.7.
  * we find that the clumpiness is mildly anti-correlated with the merger phase, decreasing towards final coalescence

* [Sensitivity analysis of a galaxy formation model](https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.01745)
  * **Interesting**
  * A variance-based sensitivity analysis (SA): 看K波段光度函数对GALFORM SAM里面的哪些参数敏感
  * We then use SA to compute Sobol’ sensitivity indices varying seven model parameters, connecting the variance in the model output to the variance in the input parameters

* [Astroinformatics based search for globular clusters in the Fornax Deep Survey](https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.01884)
  * We use a Neural-Gas model, a pure clustering machine learning methodology, to approach the GC detection, while a novel feature selection method (ΦLAB) is exploited to perform the parameter space analysis and optimization.

### Oct 7

* [Detecting the halo heating from AGN feedback with ALMA](https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.02088)
  * 用ALMA观测SZ效应来研究AGN对CGM的加热: We obtain a marginal S-Z detection (~3.3σ) on scales of about 300 kpc (30-40 arcsec), at the 0.2 mJy level
  * We emphasise that detecting an SZ signal is more easily achieved in the visibility plane than in the (inferred) images

* [Nearly all Massive Quiescent Disk Galaxies have a Surprisingly Large Atomic Gas Reservoir](https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.02093)
  * **Interesting**
  * The vast majority of the massive, quiescent, central disk galaxies in the nearby Universe have a remarkably large amount of cold atomic hydrogen gas, surprisingly similar to star-forming galaxies
  * Both star-forming and quiescent disk galaxies show identical symmetric double-horn HI spectra, indicating similar regularly rotating HI disks.

* [A DECam View of the Diffuse Dwarf Galaxy Crater II: The Colour-Magnitude Diagram](https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.02143)
  * The CMD shows only old stars with a clearly bifurcated subgiant branch (SGB) that feeds a narrow red giant branch.
  * A mean age of 12.5 Gyr for the main event and a mean age of 10.5 Gyr for the brighter SGB

* [HSC-XD 52: An X-ray detected AGN in a low-mass galaxy at z∼0.56](https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.02173)
  * We present HSC-XD 52, a spectroscopically confirmed low-mass active galactic nucleus (AGN) at an intermediate redshift of z∼0.56; 作为明亮的X-ray源被探测到，恒星质量和LMC类似，黑洞质量在10^6 Msun量级
  * HSC-XD 52 is among the most luminous X-ray selected AGN in dwarf galaxies

* [The large-scale ionization cones in the Galaxy](https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.02225)
  * 认为Magellanic stream的一部分的Halpha电离气体也是几百万年前银心Seyfert暴发的证据
  * UV absorption line ratios (in particular CIV/CII, SiIV/SiII) observed by the Hubble Space Telescope reveal that some Stream clouds towards both galactic poles are highly ionized by a source capable of producing ionization energies up to at least 50 eV.
  * We show how these are clouds caught in a beam of bipolar, radiative "ionization cones" from a Seyfert nucleus associated with Sgr A*
  * For the Stream at such large Galactic distances (D >∼ 75 kpc), nuclear activity is a plausible explanation for all of the observed signatures: elevated Hα emission and H ionization fraction (xe >∼ 0.5), enhanced CIV/CII and Si IV/Si II ratios, and high CIV and Si IV column densities

* [Two New "Turn-off" Changing-look Active Galactic nuclei and Implication on "Partially Obscured" AGNs](https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.02392)
  * A spectroscopic identification of two new changing-look AGNs (CL-AGNs): SDSS\,J104705.16+544405.8 and SDSS\,J120447.91+170256.8 both with a "turn-off" type transition from type 1 to type 1.8/1.9.
  * CL-AGNs tend to be biased against low Eddington ratio, and identify an overlap between the CL-AGNs at their dim state and the so-called intermediate-type AGNs

* [The Seoul National University AGN monitoring project. II. BLR size and black hole mass of two AGNs](https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.02412)
  * SAMP主要关注高光度AGN；~1000 days的light curves

* [Highly Embedded 8 micron Cores of Star Formation in the Spiral Arms and Filaments of 15 Nearby Disk Galaxies](https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.02535)
  * Spitzer观测近邻15个盘星系，通过unsharped mask技术可以找到很多8micron的dense core
  * The larger galaxies, which tend to have longer and more regular spiral arms, often have their infrared cores aligned along these arms, with additional cores in spiral arm spurs
  * The identified cores are the earliest phase for most star formation

* [A Framework for Measuring Weak-Lensing Magnification Using the Fundamental Plane](https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.02906)
  * **Interesting**
  * Using the fundamental plane (FP) of elliptical galaxies to anchor the size distribution of a background population is one method that has been proposed for performing a magnification measurement. We present a formalism for using the FP residuals of elliptical galaxies to jointly estimate the foreground mass and background redshift errors for a stacked lens scenario.
  * 放大效应只影响星系size，不影响其他参数；结合背景星系counts的测量可以得到更准确的前景质量的估计

* [The Lyman continuum escape fraction and the Mean Free Path of hydrogen ionizing photons for bright z~4 QSOs from SDSS DR14](https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.02775)
  * We calculate the Lyman Continuum (LyC) escape fraction as the flux ratio blue-ward (~900 A rest-frame) and red-ward (~930 A rest-frame) of the Lyman limit.
  * We find a lower limit to the mean LyC escape fraction of 0.49, in agreement with the values obtained for both brighter and fainter sources at the same redshift.
  * We show that the free paths of ionizing photons are characterized by a skewed distribution function peaked at low values, with an average of ~49-59 proper Mpc at z~4

* [The Globular Cluster Population of NGC 1052-DF2: Evidence for Rotation](https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.02778)
  * **Interesting**
  * Here we present the discovery of such a signature of rotation in the kinematics of NGC 1052-DF2's globular clusters, with a velocity amplitude of ∼12.44+4.40−5.16 km/s
  * This rotation is distinct from, and approximately perpendicular to, the recently identified rotation of the stellar component of NGC 1052-DF2

* [Rotation Measure synthesis applied on synthetic SKA images of galaxy clusters](https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.02084)
  * 看SKA1的RM测量能不能用来研究cluster中的磁场

* [How to measure CMB spectral distortions with an imaging telescope](https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.02084)
  * We propose the implementation of an imaging telescope in combination with an inter-frequency calibrator to measure the spectral shape of the microwave sky by exploiting the differences in the sky intensity between multiple pairs of frequency channels.
  * PICO可以进行这样的测量，FIRAS可以得到10-sigma的测量

* [Void Formation: Does the Void-in-Cloud Process Matter?](https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.02197)
  * 在N-body模拟的LCDM宇宙里做Void统计：The number density of voids is found to be larger than the prediction of the analytical model up to 2 orders of magnitude below 1 Mpc/h scales
  * The Press-Schechter model with the linear critical threshold of void {\delta}_v = -2.71, or a naive power law, is found to provide an excellent agreement with the void size function, suggesting that the void-in-cloud effect does not suppress as much voids as predicted
  * We then measured the density and velocity profiles of small voids, and find that they are mostly partially collapsing underdensities, instead of being completely crushed in the standard void-in-cloud scenario

* [Detectability of 21cm signal during the Epoch of Reionization with 21cm-Lyman-α emitter cross-correlation. III. Model dependence](https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.02361)
  * Cross-correlation between the 21cm line and Lyman-α emitter (LAE) galaxies is a powerful tool to identify the 21cm signal since the 21cm line emission has correlation with LAEs while the LAEs are statistically independent of the foregrounds.
  * 考虑了最新的HSC观测的LAE的光度函数和角相关

* [A Measurement of the Degree Scale CMB B-mode Angular Power Spectrum with POLARBEAR](https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.02608)
  * **Important**
  * POLARBEAR, 670 degree; 150 GHz: We achieve 32μK-arcmin effective polarization map noise with a knee in sensitivity of ℓ=90, where the inflationary gravitational wave signal is expected to peak.
  * We cross-correlate our data with Planck high frequency maps and find the low-ℓ B-mode power in the combined dataset to be consistent with thermal dust emission

* [The PAU Survey: Background light estimation with deep learning techniques](https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.02075)
  * 主要是为了改正PAUCam的scatter light效应：This paper introduces BKGnet, a deep neural network to predict the background and its associated error

### Oct 8

* [The evolution of rest-frame UV properties, Lya EWs and the SFR-Stellar mass relation at z~2-6 for SC4K LAEs](https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.02959)
  * LAE是UV挑选的高红移星系里最年轻和最缺乏尘埃的那部分
  * EW_Lya>240 AA的星系很少； Overall, we measure little to no evolution of the Lya EW0 and scale length parameter (w0) which are consistently high from z=6 to z=2
  * LAE的Lya逃逸比例都很高，和红移无关；但是低光度的低质量的LAE逃逸比例更高

* [3D Distribution Map of HI Gas and Galaxies Around an Enormous Lyα Nebula and Three QSOs at z=2.3 Revealed by the HI Tomographic Mapping Technique](https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.02962)
  * MAMMOTH1周围的IGM tomography: HI tomography map is reconstructed with HI Lyα forest absorption of bright background objects at z=2.4−2.9
  * MAMMOTH1-QSO resides in a volume with significantly weak HI absorption
  * MAMMOTH1-QSO has a proximity zone where quasar illuminates and photo-ionizes the surrounding HI gas and suppresses HI absorption, and that the ELAN is probably a photo-ionized cloud embedded in the cosmic web

* [Understanding Lyman-alpha Nebulae at Low Redshift I: The Sizes, Powering, and Kinematics of "Green Bean" Galaxies](https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.02964)
  * Our spectroscopic data show that low-z Lya nebulae have AGN-like emission line ratios, relatively narrow line widths (FWHM<1000 km s^{-1}) 发射线运动学和同红移的Type-2 AGN类似
  * Low-z Lya nebulae appear to be a subset of Type 2 AGN with bluer optical continua and high [OIII] equivalent widths but with comparable sizes and similar [OIII] kinematics.

* [Varstrometry for Off-nucleus and Dual sub-Kpc AGN (VODKA): How Well-centered Are Low-z AGN?](https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.02969)
  * 用精确的天体测量学和AGN光变信息来找off-nucleus AGN: We find that Gaia DR2 already provides strong constraints on the projected off-nucleus distance in the sub-kpc regime at these redshifts: 99%, 90% and 40% of AGN must be well-centered to <1 kpc, <500 pc and <100 pc

* [Hα Morphologies of Star Clusters: A LEGUS study of HII region evolution timescales and stochasticity in low mass clusters](https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.02983)
  * 用年轻星团周围HII区的形态来反映产生星团的气体的性质
  * 近邻3个旋涡星系中的700多个<10 Myr的年轻星团：Clusters are classified by their Hα morphology (concentrated, partially exposed, no-emission) and whether they have neighboring clusters (which could affect the clearing timescales).
  * The median ages indicate a progression from concentrated (~3 Myr), to partially exposed (~4 Myr), to no Hα emission (>5Myr)
  * Similarities in the age distributions for clusters with concentrated and partially exposed Hα morphologies imply a short timescale for gas clearing (<1Myr). 

* [On the environment of Low Surface Brightness galaxies at different scales](https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.03078)
  * **Relevant**
  * We find a slight preference for LSB galaxies to be found in filaments instead of clusters, with their mean distance to the nearest filament typically larger than for high surface brightness (HSB) galaxies
  * LSB central galaxies present more recent assembly times when compared with their HSB counterparts.
  * LSB central的spin parameter也偏高

* [Silicon and iron dust in gamma-ray burst host galaxy absorbers](https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.03207)
  * The majority of our sample (87%) show featureless extinction curves and only vary in shape.
  * However, we find no trend between the far-UV parameter of the extinction curve, c_4, and the abundance of Si and Fe in the dust phase. We, therefore, propose that the far-UV extinction could be a combined effect of small (probably nanoparticles) dust grains from various species.

* [The evolution of baryonic mass function of galaxies to z=3](https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.03216)
  * We find evidence that at log(Mbaryon/M⨀)>11.3, the BMF evolves little since z∼2.2
  * The ratio between these two quanties, ρ˙baryon/ρ˙star, decreases from ρ˙baryon/ρ˙star∼2 at z∼2.5 to ρ˙baryon/ρ˙star<0.5 at z∼0.5, suggesting that massive galaxies are transforming from the "accretion dominated" phase to the "depletion dominated" phase from high−z to low−z

* [Properties of LBGs with [OIII] detection at z ∼ 3.5: The importance of including nebular emission data in SED fitting](https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.03235)
  * 利用CIGALE测试3.0< z < 3.8的LBG SED拟合：We find that without the nebular model, the fitting overestimates the stellar mass due to the strong [OIII] lines that are redshifted to the Ks-band, consistent with previous results.

* [Evolution of compact groups from intermediate to final stages: A case study of the HI content of HCG 16](https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.03420)
  * Despite the clear disruption of the HI component of HCG 16 we find that it is not globally HI deficient, even though HCG 16a and b have lost the majority of their HI and almost 50% of the group's HI is in the IGM
  * This is expected to result in a collection of gas-poor galaxies embedded in a diffuse HI structure, which will gradually be evaporated by the UV background, resembling the final stage of the evolutionary model of compact groups

* [Origin of Giant Stellar Clumps in High-Redshift Galaxies](https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.03443)
  * **Interesting**
  * 因为分辨率和投影效应，高红移SF clump的质量可能被高估了一个量级，大小也可以被高估几倍
  * We find that most clumps of young stars present in a simulation at one time dissolve on a timescale shorter than ∼150 Myr. 大部分clump都不是bounded structure
  * The observed clumps represent random projections of multiple smaller star-forming regions

* [The Rotational Profiles of Cluster Galaxies](https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.03453)
  * SDSS BAX的merger和non-merger cluster，以及部分有dumbbell形状的星系团的分析
  * Merging stacks possess stronger core rotation at ≲0.5r200 primarily contributed by a red galaxy sub-population from relaxing core mergers, this is alongside high rotational velocities from blue galaxy sub-populations, until, they mix and homogenise with the red sub-populations at ∼r200, indicative of an infalling blue galaxy sub-population with interactive mixing between both sub-populations at ≳r200.

* [A SCUBA-2 Selected Herschel-SPIRE Dropout and the Nature of this Population](https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.03512)
  * **Interesting**
  * NGP6_D1 is a bright 850 μm source (12.3 ± 2.5 mJy) with no counterparts at shorter wavelengths (a SPIRE dropout).
  * 红移还是不知道：Template fitting suggests that NGP6_D1 is most likely between z=5.8 and 8.3.
  * We discuss the nature of NGP6_D1 in the context of the broader submm population, and find that comparable SPIRE dropouts account for ∼ 20% of all SCUBA-2 detected sources,

* [Azimuthal variations of oxygen abundance profiles in star-forming regions of of disc galaxies in the EAGLE simulations](https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.03540)
  * The mean azimuthal variation in the EAGLE discs are ∼0.12±0.03 dex R−1eff for slopes and ∼0.12±0.03 dex for the zero points
  * We find a slight trend for higher azimuthal variations in the disc components of low star-forming and bulge-dominated galaxies

* [Investigating the Hubble Constant Tension -- Two Numbers in the Standard Cosmological Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.03540)
  * **Interesting**
  * 强调了不应该单独看H0，而应该看H0-Om平面：Constraints along different degeneracy directions consistently overlap in one region of the space, with the exception of the local measurement from Cepheid variable-calibrated supernovae.
  * The local measurement is the most outlying and therefore drives the bulk of the tension.

* [Euclid: Reconstruction of Weak Lensing mass maps for non-Gaussianity studies](https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.03106)
  * 为什么convergence map重要：While carrying the same information, the lensing signal is more compressed in the convergence maps than in the shear field, simplifying otherwise computationally expensive analyses, for instance non-Gaussianity studies.
  * 改进了KS inversion method：a new mass inversion method (KS+) that aims to reduce the information loss during the mass inversion

* [LEO-Py: Estimating likelihoods for correlated, censored, and uncertain data with given marginal distributions](https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.02958)
  * **Useful**
  * Data with uncertain, missing, censored, and correlated values are commonplace in many research fields including astronomy: I present a novel approach to compute the likelihood function for such data sets.
  * This approach employs Gaussian copulas to decouple the correlation structure of variables and their marginal distributions resulting in a flexible method to compute likelihood functions of data in the presence of measurement uncertainty, censoring, and missing data.
