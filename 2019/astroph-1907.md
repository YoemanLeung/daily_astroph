### July 1

* [The MOSDEF Survey: Direct-Method Metallicities and ISM Conditions at z∼1.5−3.5](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.00013)
  * MOSFIRE探测z>1星系的[OIII] 4363线：We find that strong-line calibrations based on local analogs of high-redshift galaxies reliably reproduce the metallicity of the z > 1 sample on average.
  * 但是只用直接方法得到z>1的质量-金属丰度关系的slope和强发射线方法的不一样
  * 需要用O/Fe超过太阳丰度和考虑双星演化的模型才能解释发射线
  * We find that the z>1 sample falls on the z∼0 relation between ionization parameter and O/H, suggesting no evolution of this relation from z∼0 to z∼2.
  * 高红移的harder ionizing spectrum at fixed nebular metallicity可以用高红移快速形成时标下导致的高O/Fe来解释

* [The Gemini/HST Galaxy Cluster Project: Environment Effects on the Stellar Populations in the Lynx Clusters at z=1.27](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.00121)
  * z = 1.27 clusters Lynx E and Lynx W中的星系星族。
  * We find that Lynx E has a well-defined core of red passive galaxies, while Lynx W lacks such a core.
  * 对平均的ETG来说， 到z=0似乎需要size增大0.1dex；但是似乎BCG还需要有很明显的size evolution
  * The galaxies in the outskirts of the clusters contain younger stellar populations than found in the cluster cores. However, when evolved passively to z~0 both populations are consistent with the observed populations in the Coma cluster galaxies.

* [Axisymmetric Schwarzschild models of an isothermal axisymmetric mock dwarf spheroidal galaxy](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.00156)

* [Enhanced X-ray emission from candidate Lyman continuum emitting galaxies](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.00225)
    * X-ray binaries may have helped reionize the early Universe by enabling Lyman continuum escape.
    * 8个Local LyC星系的X-ray观测：Five of the galaxies feature X-ray sources, while three galaxies are not significantly detected in X-rays
    * The presence of detected X-ray sources within the galaxies is found to correlate with the ratio of the star formation rate estimated from the near-ultraviolet flux to that estimated from the infrared.

* [ALMA Band 3 polarimetric follow-up of a complete sample of faint PACO sources](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.00299)

* [Calibration of the virial factor f in supermassive black hole masses of reverberation-mapped AGNs](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.00315)

* [Far-Infrared Properties of the Bright, Gravitationally Lensed Quasar J0439+1634 at z=6.5](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.00385)

* [The molecular outflow in NGC253 at a resolution of two parsecs](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.00731)

* [A new estimator for gravitational lensing using galaxy and intensity mapping surveys](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.00071)
  * Propose a new tomographic estimator for the gravitational lensing potential, based on a combination of intensity mapping (IM) and galaxy counts.
  * The estimator can be written schematically as IM×galaxy − galaxy×IM; this combination allows to greatly reduce the contamination by density-density correlations, thus isolating the lensing signal.
  * For cosmic variance dominated surveys the signal-to-noise ratio is improved by a factor of around 20-30 on linear scales (ℓmax=200), with a lower improvement of around 5-10 if one includes smaller scales (ℓmax=1000).

* [Chandra observation of a cold front in Abell 2554](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.00499)
  * We confirm that A2554 is a dynamically disturbed system. We detect two dominant structures; a main cluster at z = 0.1108 and a foreground northern substructure at z = 0.1082
  * 在距离星系团中心60kpc出有一个X-ray面亮度的不连续，consistent with the definition of a cold front with a Mach number M=0.94
  * If the northern substructure was not related to the cold front, we conclude that the transonic motion of the cloud is caused by a merger, which was weak or occurred long ago.
