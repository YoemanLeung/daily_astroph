### July 1

* [The MOSDEF Survey: Direct-Method Metallicities and ISM Conditions at z∼1.5−3.5](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.00013)
  * MOSFIRE探测z>1星系的[OIII] 4363线：We find that strong-line calibrations based on local analogs of high-redshift galaxies reliably reproduce the metallicity of the z > 1 sample on average.
  * 但是只用直接方法得到z>1的质量-金属丰度关系的slope和强发射线方法的不一样
  * 需要用O/Fe超过太阳丰度和考虑双星演化的模型才能解释发射线
  * We find that the z>1 sample falls on the z∼0 relation between ionization parameter and O/H, suggesting no evolution of this relation from z∼0 to z∼2.
  * 高红移的harder ionizing spectrum at fixed nebular metallicity可以用高红移快速形成时标下导致的高O/Fe来解释

* [The Gemini/HST Galaxy Cluster Project: Environment Effects on the Stellar Populations in the Lynx Clusters at z=1.27](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.00121)
  * **Relevant, Interesting**
  * z = 1.27 clusters Lynx E and Lynx W中的星系星族。
  * We find that Lynx E has a well-defined core of red passive galaxies, while Lynx W lacks such a core.
  * 对平均的ETG来说， 到z=0似乎需要size增大0.1dex；但是似乎BCG还需要有很明显的size evolution
  * The galaxies in the outskirts of the clusters contain younger stellar populations than found in the cluster cores. However, when evolved passively to z~0 both populations are consistent with the observed populations in the Coma cluster galaxies.

* [Axisymmetric Schwarzschild models of an isothermal axisymmetric mock dwarf spheroidal galaxy](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.00156)
  * When assuming the true functional form of the potential, the Schwarzschild modelling technique is able to provide an accurate and precise measurement of the characteristic mass parameter
  * When assuming a different functional form for the potential, such as a flattened NFW profile, we also constrain the mass and scale radius to their expected values.
  * We find that the flattening parameter remains largely unconstrained. This is likely because the information content of the velocity dispersion on the geometric shape of the potential is too small, since σ is constant across our mock dSph.

* [Enhanced X-ray emission from candidate Lyman continuum emitting galaxies](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.00225)
    * X-ray binaries may have helped reionize the early Universe by enabling Lyman continuum escape.
    * 8个Local LyC星系的X-ray观测：Five of the galaxies feature X-ray sources, while three galaxies are not significantly detected in X-rays
    * The presence of detected X-ray sources within the galaxies is found to correlate with the ratio of the star formation rate estimated from the near-ultraviolet flux to that estimated from the infrared.

* [ALMA Band 3 polarimetric follow-up of a complete sample of faint PACO sources](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.00299)
  * Planck-ATCA Co-eval Observations (PACO) sample: 20GHz上明亮的compact source
  * ALMA+ATCA+MWA: We present spectra over more than 3 decades in frequency in total intensity and over about 1.7 decades in polarization
  * The spectra of our sources are smooth over the whole frequency range, with no sign of dust emission from the host galaxy at mm wavelengths nor of a sharp high frequency decline

* [Calibration of the virial factor f in supermassive black hole masses of reverberation-mapped AGNs](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.00315)
  * We calculate the virial factor f by assuming that the RM AGNs intrinsically obey the same MBH − σ∗ relation as quiescent galaxies
  * The deprojected molecular mass outflow rate is in the range ∼ 14 − 39 M⊙ yr−1 with an uncertainty of 0.4 dex.

* [Far-Infrared Properties of the Bright, Gravitationally Lensed Quasar J0439+1634 at z=6.5](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.00385)

* [The molecular outflow in NGC253 at a resolution of two parsecs](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.00731)
  * We decompose the emission into a disk and non–disk component: ∼ 7 − 16% of the CO luminosity to be associated with the non-disk component
  * The majority of this outflow rate is contributed by distinct outflows perpendicular to the disk, with a significant contribution by diffuse molecular gas. 

* [A new estimator for gravitational lensing using galaxy and intensity mapping surveys](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.00071)
  * Propose a new tomographic estimator for the gravitational lensing potential, based on a combination of intensity mapping (IM) and galaxy counts.
  * The estimator can be written schematically as IM×galaxy − galaxy×IM; this combination allows to greatly reduce the contamination by density-density correlations, thus isolating the lensing signal.
  * For cosmic variance dominated surveys the signal-to-noise ratio is improved by a factor of around 20-30 on linear scales (ℓmax=200), with a lower improvement of around 5-10 if one includes smaller scales (ℓmax=1000).

* [Chandra observation of a cold front in Abell 2554](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.00499)
  * We confirm that A2554 is a dynamically disturbed system. We detect two dominant structures; a main cluster at z = 0.1108 and a foreground northern substructure at z = 0.1082
  * 在距离星系团中心60kpc出有一个X-ray面亮度的不连续，consistent with the definition of a cold front with a Mach number M=0.94
  * If the northern substructure was not related to the cold front, we conclude that the transonic motion of the cloud is caused by a merger, which was weak or occurred long ago.

* [GASP. XX. From the loose spatially-resolved to the tight global SFR-Mass relation in local spiral galaxies](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.00976)
  * 看局部的SFR-M*关系，重点看星系外围的：Our observational strategy allows us to detect Hα out to more than 2.7re for 75% of the sample. 关系的scatter很大
  * 星系和星系间的差异很大。The scatter of the relation mainly arises from the existence of bright off-center star-forming knots whose ΣSFR-Σ∗ relation is systematically broader than that of the diffuse component

* [Rapid early coeval star formation and assembly of the most massive galaxies in the universe](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.00977)
  * **Interesting, Relevant**
  * 用模拟展示高红移可以非常有效地聚集起质量很大的星系: we show that the stellar assembly time of a sub-set of brightest cluster galaxies occurs at high redshifts (z > 3) rather than at low redshifts (z < 1)
  * highly overdense protoclusters assemble their stellar mass into brightest cluster galaxies within ∼ 1 Gyr of evolution – producing massive blue elliptical galaxies at high redshifts (z 􏰅 3).
  * On the cluster scale wherein the brightest cluster galaxies in the cores of the most-massive clusters assemble earlier than those in lower-mass clusters.
    - What we have demonstrated in the previous section is the possibility of a downsizing effect (Bower et al. 2006; Cimatti et al. 2006; Neistein et al. 2006; Fontanot et al. 2009; Oser et al. 2010) on the cluster scale, where the cores of these massive clusters could be much older than the cores of less-massive clusters, beginning to assemble at redshifts z 􏰅 2 at the minimum

* [Galactic cirri in deep optical imaging](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.00978)
  * **Interesting, Relevant**
  * We have explored the optical properties of cirri using g, r, i and z bands in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) Stripe82 region.
  * We find that their optical colors are driven by the dust column density: the cirri become redder as their 100 μm emission increases. This could explain the extended red emission previously found in dust clouds.
  * The optical colors of the Galactic cirri differ significantly from those of extragalactic sources (但其实在g-r和g-i color上差别不大)

* [Evolution of black hole and galaxy growth in a semi-numerical galaxy formation model](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.00981)
  * This method builds on a previous model for black hole accretion that uses a semi-numerical galaxy formation model and universal Eddington ratio distribution to describe the full AGN population by independently connecting galaxy and AGN growth to the evolution of the host dark matter halos.

* [Positive and negative feedback of AGN outflows in NGC 5728](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.00982)
  * VLT+ALMA观测：We find ionized gas outflows out to ∼2 kpc scales, which encounter the star formation ring at 1 kpc radius.
  * 相遇区域的SFR显著地比周围要高；但是CO辐射更弱，说明恒星形成效率更高 --> 正向的反馈
  * In addition, we detect outflow regions outside of spiral arms, in which gas is likely to be removed from the spiral arms and no clear sign of star formation is detected.

* [Constraining nuclear star cluster formation using MUSE-AO observations of the early-type galaxy FCC47](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.01007)
  * The large NSC (reff = 66 pc) and rich GC system of the early-type Fornax cluster galaxy FCC 47 (NGC 1336) render this galaxy an ideal laboratory to constrain NSC formation.
  * FCC 47 shows two decoupled components (KDCs): a rotating disk and the NSC.
  * 史瓦西轨道模型现实NSC是一个独立成分，且代表了星系里最高的金属丰度和最老的年龄
  * The GC system is bimodal with a dominant metal-poor population and the total GC system mass is ∼ 17% of the NSC mass
  * 不太能用GC向中心掉落并合的模型来解释NSC的形成; 需要高效的 in-situ SF，可能和并合有关

* [Discovery of geometry transition in nearby AGN jets](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.01485)
  * We have performed an automated search for jet shape breaks in a sample of 367 AGN using VLBA data at 2 cm and 22 cm.
  * This search has found ten nearby jets at redshifts z < 0.07 with a transition from a parabolic to conical shape 可能是一种普遍现象
  * We estimate that the break typically occurs at a distance of 10^5–10^6 gravitational radii from the nucleus.
  * We suggest that the jet shape transition happens when the bulk plasma kinetic energy flux becomes equal to the Poynting energy flux, while the ambient medium pressure is assumed to be governed by Bondi accretion.

* [Beyond two-point statistics: using the Minimum Spanning Tree as a tool for cosmology](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.00989)
  * 利用Minimum Spanning Tree (MST)探索大尺度结构: N-body particles or haloes are used as nodes to construct a unique graph, the MST, which is defined to be the minimum weighted spanning graph.
  * 利用COLA宇宙模拟中的不同宇宙学下的功率谱和Bispectrum，加上MST探索对宇宙学参数的限制：MST is providing additional information not present in the power spectrum and bispectrum

* [Constraints on dark matter annihilation in dwarf spheroidal galaxies from low frequency radio observations](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.00979)
  * First observational limits on the predicted synchrotron signals from particle Dark Matter annihilation models in dwarf spheroidal galaxies at radio frequencies below 1 GHz.
  * For in-situ magnetic fields of 1 μG and any plausible value for the diffusion coefficient, our limits do not constrain any Dark Matter models.
    -  The synchrotron radiation produced because of self-annihilating dark matter (DM) candidate particles in dwarf spheroidal (dSph) galaxies (objects with high mass-to-light ratios indicating a high abundance of DM) can be a promising probe of DM models

* [Estimating black hole masses: Reverberation Mapping versus Accretion Disk Fitting](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.00986)
  * 对一批有RM黑洞质量估计的Type I AGN进行光谱的吸积盘模型拟合：KERRBB，估计黑洞质量和吸积率
  * The two estimates are compatible within the uncertainties, assuming a black hole with a spin in the range 0 ≤ a ≤ 0.9982 and a viewing angle of the system ≤ 45◦
  * The overall uncertainty on the black hole mass estimated through the disk fitting procedure is ∼ 0.45 dex

* [A fast radio burst localised to a massive galaxy](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.01542)
  * Here we report the localisation of a fast radio burst (FRB 190523) to a few-arcsecond region containing a single massive galaxy at a redshift of 0.66
  * This galaxy is in stark contrast to the host of FRB 121102, being a thousand times more massive, with a greater than hundred times lower specific star-formation rate. The properties of this galaxy highlight the possibility of a channel for FRB production associated with older stellar populations.
