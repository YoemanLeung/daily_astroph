### July 1

* [The MOSDEF Survey: Direct-Method Metallicities and ISM Conditions at z∼1.5−3.5](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.00013)
  * MOSFIRE探测z>1星系的[OIII] 4363线：We find that strong-line calibrations based on local analogs of high-redshift galaxies reliably reproduce the metallicity of the z > 1 sample on average.
  * 但是只用直接方法得到z>1的质量-金属丰度关系的slope和强发射线方法的不一样
  * 需要用O/Fe超过太阳丰度和考虑双星演化的模型才能解释发射线
  * We find that the z>1 sample falls on the z∼0 relation between ionization parameter and O/H, suggesting no evolution of this relation from z∼0 to z∼2.
  * 高红移的harder ionizing spectrum at fixed nebular metallicity可以用高红移快速形成时标下导致的高O/Fe来解释

* [The Gemini/HST Galaxy Cluster Project: Environment Effects on the Stellar Populations in the Lynx Clusters at z=1.27](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.00121)
  * **Relevant, Interesting**
  * z = 1.27 clusters Lynx E and Lynx W中的星系星族。
  * We find that Lynx E has a well-defined core of red passive galaxies, while Lynx W lacks such a core.
  * 对平均的ETG来说， 到z=0似乎需要size增大0.1dex；但是似乎BCG还需要有很明显的size evolution
  * The galaxies in the outskirts of the clusters contain younger stellar populations than found in the cluster cores. However, when evolved passively to z~0 both populations are consistent with the observed populations in the Coma cluster galaxies.

* [Axisymmetric Schwarzschild models of an isothermal axisymmetric mock dwarf spheroidal galaxy](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.00156)
  * When assuming the true functional form of the potential, the Schwarzschild modelling technique is able to provide an accurate and precise measurement of the characteristic mass parameter
  * When assuming a different functional form for the potential, such as a flattened NFW profile, we also constrain the mass and scale radius to their expected values.
  * We find that the flattening parameter remains largely unconstrained. This is likely because the information content of the velocity dispersion on the geometric shape of the potential is too small, since σ is constant across our mock dSph.

* [Enhanced X-ray emission from candidate Lyman continuum emitting galaxies](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.00225)
    * X-ray binaries may have helped reionize the early Universe by enabling Lyman continuum escape.
    * 8个Local LyC星系的X-ray观测：Five of the galaxies feature X-ray sources, while three galaxies are not significantly detected in X-rays
    * The presence of detected X-ray sources within the galaxies is found to correlate with the ratio of the star formation rate estimated from the near-ultraviolet flux to that estimated from the infrared.

* [ALMA Band 3 polarimetric follow-up of a complete sample of faint PACO sources](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.00299)
  * Planck-ATCA Co-eval Observations (PACO) sample: 20GHz上明亮的compact source
  * ALMA+ATCA+MWA: We present spectra over more than 3 decades in frequency in total intensity and over about 1.7 decades in polarization
  * The spectra of our sources are smooth over the whole frequency range, with no sign of dust emission from the host galaxy at mm wavelengths nor of a sharp high frequency decline

* [Calibration of the virial factor f in supermassive black hole masses of reverberation-mapped AGNs](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.00315)
  * We calculate the virial factor f by assuming that the RM AGNs intrinsically obey the same MBH − σ∗ relation as quiescent galaxies
  * The deprojected molecular mass outflow rate is in the range ∼ 14 − 39 M⊙ yr−1 with an uncertainty of 0.4 dex.

* [Far-Infrared Properties of the Bright, Gravitationally Lensed Quasar J0439+1634 at z=6.5](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.00385)

* [The molecular outflow in NGC253 at a resolution of two parsecs](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.00731)
  * We decompose the emission into a disk and non–disk component: ∼ 7 − 16% of the CO luminosity to be associated with the non-disk component
  * The majority of this outflow rate is contributed by distinct outflows perpendicular to the disk, with a significant contribution by diffuse molecular gas.

* [A new estimator for gravitational lensing using galaxy and intensity mapping surveys](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.00071)
  * Propose a new tomographic estimator for the gravitational lensing potential, based on a combination of intensity mapping (IM) and galaxy counts.
  * The estimator can be written schematically as IM×galaxy − galaxy×IM; this combination allows to greatly reduce the contamination by density-density correlations, thus isolating the lensing signal.
  * For cosmic variance dominated surveys the signal-to-noise ratio is improved by a factor of around 20-30 on linear scales (ℓmax=200), with a lower improvement of around 5-10 if one includes smaller scales (ℓmax=1000).

* [Chandra observation of a cold front in Abell 2554](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.00499)
  * We confirm that A2554 is a dynamically disturbed system. We detect two dominant structures; a main cluster at z = 0.1108 and a foreground northern substructure at z = 0.1082
  * 在距离星系团中心60kpc出有一个X-ray面亮度的不连续，consistent with the definition of a cold front with a Mach number M=0.94
  * If the northern substructure was not related to the cold front, we conclude that the transonic motion of the cloud is caused by a merger, which was weak or occurred long ago.

### July 2

* [GASP. XX. From the loose spatially-resolved to the tight global SFR-Mass relation in local spiral galaxies](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.00976)
  * 看局部的SFR-M*关系，重点看星系外围的：Our observational strategy allows us to detect Hα out to more than 2.7re for 75% of the sample. 关系的scatter很大
  * 星系和星系间的差异很大。The scatter of the relation mainly arises from the existence of bright off-center star-forming knots whose ΣSFR-Σ∗ relation is systematically broader than that of the diffuse component

* [Rapid early coeval star formation and assembly of the most massive galaxies in the universe](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.00977)
  * **Interesting, Relevant**
  * 用模拟展示高红移可以非常有效地聚集起质量很大的星系: we show that the stellar assembly time of a sub-set of brightest cluster galaxies occurs at high redshifts (z > 3) rather than at low redshifts (z < 1)
  * highly overdense protoclusters assemble their stellar mass into brightest cluster galaxies within ∼ 1 Gyr of evolution – producing massive blue elliptical galaxies at high redshifts (z 􏰅 3).
  * On the cluster scale wherein the brightest cluster galaxies in the cores of the most-massive clusters assemble earlier than those in lower-mass clusters.
    - What we have demonstrated in the previous section is the possibility of a downsizing effect (Bower et al. 2006; Cimatti et al. 2006; Neistein et al. 2006; Fontanot et al. 2009; Oser et al. 2010) on the cluster scale, where the cores of these massive clusters could be much older than the cores of less-massive clusters, beginning to assemble at redshifts z 􏰅 2 at the minimum

* [Galactic cirri in deep optical imaging](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.00978)
  * **Interesting, Relevant**
  * We have explored the optical properties of cirri using g, r, i and z bands in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) Stripe82 region.
  * We find that their optical colors are driven by the dust column density: the cirri become redder as their 100 μm emission increases. This could explain the extended red emission previously found in dust clouds.
  * The optical colors of the Galactic cirri differ significantly from those of extragalactic sources (但其实在g-r和g-i color上差别不大)

* [Evolution of black hole and galaxy growth in a semi-numerical galaxy formation model](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.00981)
  * This method builds on a previous model for black hole accretion that uses a semi-numerical galaxy formation model and universal Eddington ratio distribution to describe the full AGN population by independently connecting galaxy and AGN growth to the evolution of the host dark matter halos.

* [Positive and negative feedback of AGN outflows in NGC 5728](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.00982)
  * VLT+ALMA观测：We find ionized gas outflows out to ∼2 kpc scales, which encounter the star formation ring at 1 kpc radius.
  * 相遇区域的SFR显著地比周围要高；但是CO辐射更弱，说明恒星形成效率更高 --> 正向的反馈
  * In addition, we detect outflow regions outside of spiral arms, in which gas is likely to be removed from the spiral arms and no clear sign of star formation is detected.

* [Constraining nuclear star cluster formation using MUSE-AO observations of the early-type galaxy FCC47](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.01007)
  * The large NSC (reff = 66 pc) and rich GC system of the early-type Fornax cluster galaxy FCC 47 (NGC 1336) render this galaxy an ideal laboratory to constrain NSC formation.
  * FCC 47 shows two decoupled components (KDCs): a rotating disk and the NSC.
  * 史瓦西轨道模型现实NSC是一个独立成分，且代表了星系里最高的金属丰度和最老的年龄
  * The GC system is bimodal with a dominant metal-poor population and the total GC system mass is ∼ 17% of the NSC mass
  * 不太能用GC向中心掉落并合的模型来解释NSC的形成; 需要高效的 in-situ SF，可能和并合有关

* [Discovery of geometry transition in nearby AGN jets](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.01485)
  * We have performed an automated search for jet shape breaks in a sample of 367 AGN using VLBA data at 2 cm and 22 cm.
  * This search has found ten nearby jets at redshifts z < 0.07 with a transition from a parabolic to conical shape 可能是一种普遍现象
  * We estimate that the break typically occurs at a distance of 10^5–10^6 gravitational radii from the nucleus.
  * We suggest that the jet shape transition happens when the bulk plasma kinetic energy flux becomes equal to the Poynting energy flux, while the ambient medium pressure is assumed to be governed by Bondi accretion.

* [Beyond two-point statistics: using the Minimum Spanning Tree as a tool for cosmology](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.00989)
  * 利用Minimum Spanning Tree (MST)探索大尺度结构: N-body particles or haloes are used as nodes to construct a unique graph, the MST, which is defined to be the minimum weighted spanning graph.
  * 利用COLA宇宙模拟中的不同宇宙学下的功率谱和Bispectrum，加上MST探索对宇宙学参数的限制：MST is providing additional information not present in the power spectrum and bispectrum

* [Constraints on dark matter annihilation in dwarf spheroidal galaxies from low frequency radio observations](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.00979)
  * First observational limits on the predicted synchrotron signals from particle Dark Matter annihilation models in dwarf spheroidal galaxies at radio frequencies below 1 GHz.
  * For in-situ magnetic fields of 1 μG and any plausible value for the diffusion coefficient, our limits do not constrain any Dark Matter models.
    -  The synchrotron radiation produced because of self-annihilating dark matter (DM) candidate particles in dwarf spheroidal (dSph) galaxies (objects with high mass-to-light ratios indicating a high abundance of DM) can be a promising probe of DM models

* [Estimating black hole masses: Reverberation Mapping versus Accretion Disk Fitting](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.00986)
  * 对一批有RM黑洞质量估计的Type I AGN进行光谱的吸积盘模型拟合：KERRBB，估计黑洞质量和吸积率
  * The two estimates are compatible within the uncertainties, assuming a black hole with a spin in the range 0 ≤ a ≤ 0.9982 and a viewing angle of the system ≤ 45◦
  * The overall uncertainty on the black hole mass estimated through the disk fitting procedure is ∼ 0.45 dex

* [A fast radio burst localised to a massive galaxy](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.01542)
  * Here we report the localisation of a fast radio burst (FRB 190523) to a few-arcsecond region containing a single massive galaxy at a redshift of 0.66
  * This galaxy is in stark contrast to the host of FRB 121102, being a thousand times more massive, with a greater than hundred times lower specific star-formation rate. The properties of this galaxy highlight the possibility of a channel for FRB production associated with older stellar populations.

### July 3

* [Neutron star mergers and rare core-collapse supernovae as sources of r-process enrichment in simulated galaxies](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.01557)
  * 利用Auriga模拟研究银河系类型星系里r过程的增丰过程：from both binary neutron star mergers and rare core-collapse supernovae
  * We find that the majority of metal-poor stars are r-process enriched in all our enrichment models.
  * The scatter in r-process abundance increases for models with longer delay times or lower rates of r-process producing events.
  * Current (sparse and potentially biased) observations of metal-poor stars in the Milky Way seem to prefer rare core-collapse supernovae over neutron star mergers as the dominant source of r-process elements.

* [Observational Properties of Ultra-Diffuse Galaxies in the Field: Field-UDGs are Predominantly Blue and Starforming](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.01559)
  * **Relevant**
  * We have used the public Kilo-Degree Survey (KiDS) together with the Hyper Suprime-Cam Subaru Strategic Program (HSC-SSP) to constrain the abundance and properties of UDGs in the field
  * We show that a scenario in which cluster-like red sequence UDGs occupy a significant number of field galaxies is unlikely, with most field UDGs being significantly bluer and showing signs of localised star formation. 能给出field里面UDG密度的上限估计
  * UDGs are much more efficiently quenched in high-density environments
  * We also compare the total field abundance of UDGs to a measurement of the abundance of HI-rich UDGs from the literature, suggesting that they occupy at least one-fifth of the overall UDG population

* [The Fundamental Relations between Halo Mass and Galaxy Group Properties](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.01560)
  * **Interesting**
  * 具有blue和red central的星系群可能有着不同的聚集历史：blue的星系和halo都能继续增长质量；而red的星系的质量可能已经基本停滞，但halo还可以继续成长 (but mergers?)
  * 对SAM模型L-Galaxies给出的groups利用随机森林进行对group质量的回归分析：the results given by RF regressor are fully consistent with the prediction from our simple scenario and hence provide strong support to it
  * 除了RF预测外，还用ordinary least squared (OLS) regression model给出了经验公式的预测。对red和blue groups采用了不同的参数选择；使用 Schwarz information criterion (SIC)来判断拟合好坏。

* [The Dependence of AGN Activity on Environment in SDSS](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.01563)
  * At a given stellar mass, the specific star formation rate distribution of the AGN host galaxies remains unchanged with over-density, with the peak of the distribution around the Green Valley.
  * 给定恒星质量上，由卫星星系数量定义的overdensity影响AGN比例：overdensity越高，AGN比例越高; 但在传统等一下，这个其实是由passive星系的比例驱动的
  * 作者认为AGN比例应该定义在AGN对SF星系上: With the new definition, we find little dependence of AGN fraction on over-density, central/satellite, and group halo mass.
  * Our results support the scenario that internal secular evolution is the predominant mechanism of triggering AGN activity, while external environment related processes only play a minor role.

* [The Southern Photometric Local Universe Survey (S-PLUS): improved SEDs, morphologies and redshifts with 12 optical filters](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.01567)
  * **Interesting, Important**
  * Imaging ~9300 deg^2 of the celestial sphere in twelve optical bands using a dedicated 0.8 m robotic telescope, the T80-South
  * A field-of-view of 2 deg^2 with a plate scale of 0.55"/pixel.
  * S-PLUS uses the Javalambre 12-band magnitude system, which includes the 5 u', g', r', i', z' broad-band filters and 7 narrow-band filters centered on prominent stellar spectral features: the Balmer jump/[OII], Ca H+K, H-delta, G-band, Mg b triplet, H-alpha, and the Ca triplet.
  * S-PLUS delivers accurate photometric redshifts (delta_z/(1+z) = 0.02 or better) for galaxies with r' < 20 AB mag and redshift < 0.5

* [Multi-wavelength Campaign on NGC 7469 VI. Photoionisation Modelling of the Emission Line Regions and the Warm Absorber](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.01946)
  * We apply the photoionisation model, PION, within the spectral fitting code SPEX to analyse the 640 ks RGS spectrum of NGC 7469
  * We find the emission line region in NGC 7469 to be multiphased, consisting of two narrow components with ionisation parameters of logξ=0.4 and 1.6. 同时还有一个宽线外流成分
  * In addition, we model the photoionised plasma of the warm absorber (WA) in NGC 7469, and find that it consists of three photoionised phases
  * The environment of NGC 7469 is a complex mix of plasma winds absorbing and emitting X-rays. We find the picture painted by our results can be attributed to line emitting plasma located at distances ranging from near the black hole to the torus and beyond the ionised outflows.

* [The dwarf galaxy satellite system of Centaurus A](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.02012)
  * **Interesting**
  * Deep FORS2观测15个dwarf候选，利用Bayesian方法通过TRGB定距离，确认了9个dwarf是真的卫星星系
  * The properties of the new dwarfs are similar to those in the Local Group in terms of their sizes, luminosities, and mean metallicities. 没有被潮汐扰动的迹象
  * 通过isochrones定金属丰度没有发现丰度在卫星星系里变化很大，但是有些dwarf中有extended SF （as evidenced by a population of asymptotic giant branch stars brighter than the red giant branch tip）
  * 和TNG模拟星系的光度函数比较：CenA seems to be missing its brightest satellites and has an overabundance of the faintest dwarfs in comparison to its simulated analogs.

* [Constraining the inner density slope of massive galaxy clusters](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.01680)
  * **Relevant, Interesting**
  * Cluster-EAGLE中大质量星系团的模拟，看能不能通过恒星运动学以及引力透镜估计出中心的质量分布轮廓：可以
  * 和Andrew Newman的结果比较，发现C-EAGLE星系团的gNFW质量分布拟合给出的profile明显比观测得到的要陡
  * The mean mass-weighted dark matter density slopes, γ¯dm, are remarkably similar in the simulated and real clusters.
  * Slope的估计对于WL测量scale radius很敏感

* [The Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array Sky Survey (VLASS). Science case, survey design and initial results](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.01981)
  * The Very Large Array Sky Survey (VLASS) is a synoptic, all-sky radio sky survey with a unique combination of high angular resolution (≈2.5"), sensitivity (a 1σ goal of 70 μJy/beam in the coadded data), full linear Stokes polarimetry, time domain coverage, and wide bandwidth (2-4 GHz).
  * 到2024年将覆盖VLA能观测的全天，33885 deg^2；分三次观测

### July 4

* [Radiation hydrodynamics simulations of the evolution of the diffuse ionized gas in disc galaxies](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.02067)
  * 关于在盘星系中，盘上方kpc以上的地方，是什么样的机制给DIG提供了足够的压力。we investigate if the pressure increase caused by photoionization can provide this support.
  * We find that photoionization feedback can drive low levels of turbulence in the dense galactic disc, and that it provides pressure support for an extended diffuse gas layer.
  * 在星系能提供的电离能量和不同电离态的ISM中气体质量之间有一点精细调节的感觉

* [The prevalence of pseudo-bulges in the Auriga simulations](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.02082)
  * The bulges of the Auriga galaxies show a large variety in their shapes, sizes and formation histories
  * 按Sersic index和规则旋转运动等特征区分，大部分属于“伪核球”
  * Auriga bulges show mostly an in-situ origin, 21% of them with a negligible accreted fraction ( facc < 0.01).
  * Their in-situ component was centrally formed, with ∼ 75% of the bulges forming most of their stars inside the bulge region at z = 0.
  * In 90% of the Auriga bulges, the accreted bulge component originates from less than four satellites.
  * 核球质量和吸积比例没有明显相关。

* [Exploring a new definition of the green valley and its implications](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.02093)
  * **Interesting**
  * We exploit an alternative definition of the GV using the 4,000A break strength, an indicator that is more resilient than colour to dust attenuation.
  * By use of high SNR stacked spectra of the quiescent GV subsample, we derive the simple stellar population (SSP) age difference across the GV, a rough proxy of the quenching timescale (∆t).
  * We obtain an increasing trend with velocity dispersion (σ), from ∆t∼1.5Gyr at σ=100kms−1, up to 3.5 Gyr at σ=200 km s−1, followed by a rapid decrease in the most massive GV galaxies 

* [Early-type galaxies in low-density environments: NGC 6876 explored through its globular cluster system](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.02108)
  * **Relevant**
  * Pavo Group的中心星系，光度很高；CGS中的星系
  * The selected globular cluster (GC) candidates present a clear bimodal colour distribution at different galactocentric radii
  * The azimuthal projected distribution shows an overdensity in the red subpopulation in the direction of a trail observed in X-ray that could be evidence of interactions with its spiral neighbour NGC6872.
  * 用GC数量估计halo质量10^13左右，确实是group里面的大质量星系

* [J-PLUS: Synthetic galaxy catalogues with emission lines for photometric surveys](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.02111)
  * **Relevant, Important**
  * A synthetic galaxy lightcone specially designed for narrow-band optical photometric surveys
  * Millennium模拟+L-Galaxies SAM；加入一系列发射线
  * We study the ability of the survey to correctly identify, with a simple three filter method, a population of emission-line galaxies at various redshifts.
  * We show that the 4000Å break in the spectral energy distribution of galaxies can be misidentified as line emission. However, all significant excess (larger than 0.4 magnitudes) can be correctly and unambiguously attributed to emission line galaxies.

* [Clues on Arp 142: The Spiral-Elliptical merger](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.02193)
  * 相互作用区域的HII区的Gemini观测，发现SFR和整体比有显著的提升。Star-forming regions on this galaxy display oxygen abundances that are consistent with solar metallicities
  * Diagnostic diagrams suggest that the central region of NGC 2936 is ionized by AGN activity and the eastern tidal plume in NGC 2936 is experiencing a burst of star formation, which may be triggered by the gas compression; shock可以解释这些区域的电离

* [On the nature of a shell of young stars in the outskirts of the Small Magellanic Cloud](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.02264)
  * We present new deep images of a shell-like over-density of stars in the outskirts of the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC). SMASH测光+Gaia2运动学
  * The shell is composed of a young population with an age ~ 150 Myr, with no contribution from an old population. 不像是潮汐瓦解形成的。
  * The spatial distribution of the young main-sequence stars shows a rich sub-structure, with a spiral arm-like feature emanating from the main shell
  * we suggest that the shell formed in a recent star formation event, likely triggered by an interaction with the Large Magellanic Cloud and/or the Milky Way, ~150 Myr ago.

* [The missing dwarf galaxies of the Local Group](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.02463)
  * The simulations, from the APOSTLE project, indicate that the total mass within 3 Mpc of the pair’s midpoint (M3Mpc) typically exceeds ∼ 3 times the sum of the virial masses of the two primaries and that the dwarf galaxy formation efficiency per unit mass is uniform throughout the volume.
  * At lower galaxy masses, however, the satellite fraction is sub- stantially higher (42 per cent for M∗ > 10^5 M⊙, or 42 out of 99) 按照这个估计，∼ 50 dwarf galaxies at least as massive as the Draco dwarf spheroidal are missing from our current LG field dwarf inventory
  * The simulations indicate that most missing dwarfs should lie near the virial boundaries of the two LG primaries

* [Reflection geometries in absorbed and unabsorbed AGN](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.02523)
  * NuStar观测83个AGN: Our main goal is to investigate the variation of the Compton hump amongst a population of sources and correlate it with other spectral properties to constrain the source geometry.
  * We found a stronger reflection in mildly obscured sources
  * 不同类型的AGN中，反射体可能不同；非遮挡的AGN里，可能主要看到的是来自吸积盘的反射；而obscured AGN中可能主要还是clumpy torus的贡献。
  * The filling factor of the clouds surrounding the active nucleus is a key parameter that drives the appearance of AGN.

* [Three- and two-point spatial correlations of intergalactic medium at z∼2 using projected quasar triplets](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.02086)
  * X-Shooter spectra of three background quasar triplets probing transverse separations of 0.5-1.6 pMpc.
  * 2P和3P相关分析：statistics based on transmitted flux and clouds identified using Voigt profile fitting. Q: reduced 3-p correlation
  * Our simulations suggest an increase in correlation amplitudes and Q with increasing N_HI
  * Additionally, we conclude a positive Civ-Lyα correlations for higher NHI thresholds up to a scale of ∼ 1000 kms−1both in transverse and longitudinal directions. 

* [Detection of anti-correlation of hot and cold baryons in galaxy clusters](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.02502)
  * **Relevant, Interesting**
  * Hydrodynamic simulations indicate that the highest-mass systems retain the cosmic fraction of baryons, a natural consequence of which is anti-correlation between the masses of hot gas and stars within dark matter halos of fixed total mass.
  * We report observational detection of this anti-correlation based on 4 elements of a 9×9 element covariance matrix for nine cluster properties
  * Our detection of anti-correlation is consistent with predictions from contemporary hydrodynamic cosmological simulations that were not tuned to reproduce this signal.

### July 7

* [Resolved [CII] Emission from z>6 Quasar Host -- Companion Galaxy Pairs](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.02536)
  * 在高红移QSO host里进行高分辨[CII]观测：physical extents of 3.2 − 5.4 kpc
  * The dust continuum is on-average 40% more compact, which results in larger [C II] deficits in the center of the galaxies.
  * Four of the galaxies show [C II] velocity fields that are consistent with ordered rotation, while the remaining six galaxies show no clear velocity gradient.
  * 速度弥散度很高，说明星系里的ISM非常turbulent
  * Tidal interactions are not the only viable method for fueling their active centers.

* [Clustering with JWST: Constraining Galaxy Host Halo Masses, Satellite Quenching Efficiencies, and Merger Rates at z=4-10](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.02546)
  * 用UniverseMachine预测z=4-10的星系clustering，以及JWST的观测
  * We find that galaxy clustering will be measured with 􏰅5σ significance at z∼4−10. Halo mass precisions resulting from Cycle 1 angular clustering measurements will be ∼0.2 dex for faint (-18<MUV<-19) galaxies at z∼4−10 as well as ∼0.3 dex for bright (MUV ∼ -20) galaxies at z∼4−7.
  * Future JWST observations will therefore provide the first constraints on the stellar-halo mass relation in the epoch of reionization and substantially clarify how this relation evolves at z>4
  * We also find that ∼1000 individual satellites will be identifiable at z∼4−8 with JWST, enabling strong tests of satellite quenching evolution beyond currently available data (z􏰄<2).

* [Spectral Energy Distributions of Companion Galaxies to z∼6 Quasars](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.02607)
  * 对ALMA探测到的z>6的QSO的富尘埃的伴星系进行各种follow-up观测。
  * Three companion galaxies do not show significant emission in the observed optical/IR wavelength range. The photometric limits suggest that these galaxies are highly dust–enshrouded
  * However, the companion to PJ167-13 shows bright rest–frame UV emission (F140W AB = 25.48). 质量不低，恒星形成率在50 Msun/yr左右。

* [Are Narrow Line Seyfert 1 Galaxies powered by low mass black holes?](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.02683)
  * The broad band spectral energy distribution of the γ-ray emitting NLS1s are found to be similar to flat spectrum radio quasars. 也许说明有些NLS1的黑洞质量不高
  * 对不同的NLS1的SED进行标准吸积盘的拟合，估计黑洞质量：NLS1s the derived MAD values are about an order of BH magnitude larger than their virial estimates. 和宽线Type 1黑洞质量类似。

* [A luminous molecular gas pair beyond redshift 7](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.02721)
  * 第一次在z>7发现分子气体：属于一个高红移QSO host和其伴星系
  * The molecular gas of both companions is detected in two rotational transition lines of carbon monoxide, CO(6–5) and CO(7–6) 总分子气体质量可能在10^10 Msun左右
  * The detected CO and Lyα emission likely originate from a system of interacting star-forming galaxies that might host a quasar(s).

* [UV regulated star formation in high-redshift galaxies](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.02958)
  * We aim to systematically study the role of UV radiation in suppressing star formation in primordial galaxies by means of destroying molecular hydrogen
  * To accomplish this goal, we perform three dimensional cosmological simulations of minihalos in different environments forming at z ∼ 25 immersed in a background radiation field with varying strength of UV flux below the Lyman limit between 0.01-1000 in units of J21 = 10^−21 erg/cm2/s/Hz/sr.
  * Our results show that H2 formation is suppressed, delaying gravitational collapse until halos reach the atomic cooling limit.
  * 冷致密分子气体的形成被延迟了100-230 Myr.

* [A SHARP view of H0LiCOW: H0 from three time-delay gravitational lens systems with adaptive optics imaging](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.02533)
  * **Important**
  * Present the measurement of the Hubble Constant, H0, with three strong gravitational lens systems.
  * we combine new adaptive optics (AO) imaging from the Keck Telescope, obtained as part of the SHARP AO effort, with Hubble Space Telescope (HST ) imaging, velocity dispersion measurements, and a description of the line-of-sight mass distribution to build an accurate and precise lens mass model.
  * The joint AO only result for the three lenses is H = 75.6+3.2 kms−1 Mpc−1.

* [Beyond UVJ: More Efficient Selection of Quiescent Galaxies With UV / Mid-IR Fluxes](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.02970)
  * **Useful, Interesting**
  * 用Bayesian方法，prospector，研究UVJ和full SED的区别: Notably this model uses both nonparametric SFHs and a flexible dust attenuation curve, both of which have the potential to `break' the typical correlations observed in UVJ color-color space
  * These fits confirm observed trends between UVJ colors and observed galaxy properties, including specific star formation rate (sSFR), dust attenuation, stellar age, and stellar metallicity. They also demonstrate that UVJ colors do not, on their own, constrain stellar age or metallicity
  * UVJ plane随着红移演化，而且在非常低的sSFR上饱和。
  * We show that far-UV and/or MIR fluxes continue to correlate with sSFR down to low sSFRs and can be used in color-color diagrams to efficiently target galaxies with much lower levels of ongoing star formation

* [Dark and luminous satellites of LMC-mass galaxies in the FIRE simulations](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.02979)
  * CDM下面，LMC这样的矮星系也应该有很多subhalo，也应该有自己的矮星系：像LMC和Carina, Fornax, Car2/3, Hor1, Hyd1那样。
  * FIRE模拟：we find that, within 0.2 r200, LMC-mass hosts deplete ~30% of their substructure, significantly lower than the ~70% of substructure depleted by Milky Way (MW) mass hosts.
  * satellite数量和LMC基本符合，但是LF过陡
  * We predict that tidal stripping within the LMC potential lowers the inner dark matter density of ultra faint companions of the LMC.

* [The Evolution of O I over 3.2 < z < 6.5: Reionization of the Circumgalactic Medium](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.02983)
  * Keck+VLT观测，用中性氧示踪高红移金属演化：detect 74 O I absorbers, of which 57 are separated from the background QSO by more than 5000 km/s.
  * 数密度不是简单单调随着红移降低而升高：在高红移OI吸收系统更多；说明高红移处于低电离态的金属更多。
  * Absorption from highly ionized metals traced by C IV is also weaker in higher-redshift O I systems, supporting this picture.

* [Extragalactic thick disc properties recovered from ultra-deep Stripe82 imaging](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.02995)
  * **Interesting, Relevant**
  * IAC-S82 gri合并图像，深度达到了 r~29 mag/arcsec^2. 5个侧向星系
  * The galaxy disc components are fitted considering that the thin and thick discs are two stellar fluids that are gravitationally coupled in hydrostatic equilibrium
  * We find that effects due to the PSF are significant when low surface brightness is reached, especially in the vertical profiles, but it can be accounted for by careful modelling.
  * 如果不考虑PSF，面亮度会被高估很多。
  * The thick disc component is required to reach satisfactory fit results in the more complex galaxies in our sample, although it is not required for all galaxies.

* [NGC 326: X-shaped no more](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.03274)
  * LOFAR观测典型的X-shape射电星系，show that the formerly known wings of the radio lobes extend smoothly into a large-scale
  * 认为这个结构更可能是halo并和导致，而不是jet的重定向
  * Some X-shaped sources may be signposts of cluster merger activity, and it would be useful to investigate the environments of these objects more generally.

* [3C 294 revisited: Deep Large Binocular Telescope AO NIR images and optical spectroscopy](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.03293)
  * We resolve the 3C~294 system into three distinct components separated by a few tenths of an arcsecond on our images. One is compact, the other two are extended, and all appear to be non-stellar. 但这些成分的具体性质并不清楚，可能是merger
  * We can now uniquely associate the radio source of 3C~294 with one of the extended components. Based on our spectroscopy, we determined a redshift of z = 1.784+-0.001

* [Simulations Find Our Accounting of Dust-Obscured Star Formation May Be Incomplete](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.03354)
  * 用Hydro模拟看探测尘埃遮挡的SF的bias：We find that for IR luminous galaxies that are in rapidly quenching systems (e.g. post-coalescence) standard luminosity-to-SFR relations can strongly overestimate the true SFRs.
  * 用IR/1.6 micron的颜色可以更好的找到这些系统。UVJ plane会误认一些dusty SB系统，可能是因为消光率的问题
  * Our results support the view that we need a panchromatic approach from the rest-frame UV through the IR and SED modeling that includes realistic SFHs and allows for variable attenuation curves

* [Star formation in low-redshift cluster dwarf galaxies](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.03400)
  * CFHT观测的15个星系团的LF：Marginal evidence was found for an increase in the faint-end slope of the u-band LF relative to the r-band with increasing cluster-centric radius.
  * The dwarf-to-giant ratio (DGR) was found to increase toward the cluster outskirts, with the u-band DGR increasing faster with cluster-centric radius compared to the r-band.
  * 试图用concentration来区分有nuclei和没有的dwarf：The ratio of high-C to low-C dwarf galaxies was found to be ~2 times greater in the inner cluster region compared to the cluster outskirts (2.8sigma level).
  * The faint-end slope of the r- and u-band LF for the cluster outskirts (0.6 < r/r_200 < 1.0) is steeper than the SDSS field LF.

* [Isolated dark matter deprived galaxies in hydrodynamical simulations: real objects or artefacts?](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.03542)
  * **Interesting**
  * 在hydro模拟里面找孤立的，DM被耗尽的系统：found a handful of promising objects in all except Horizon-AGN.
  * All of them were located at the edge of their respective simulation boxes. 
  * We provide strong evidence that these oddballs were created from regular galaxies that get torn apart due to unphysical processes when crossing the edge of the simulation box

* [Revisiting the Fanaroff-Riley dichotomy and radio-galaxy morphology with the LOFAR Two-Metre Sky Survey (LoTSS)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.03726)
  * We revisit this canonical relationship with a sample of 5805 extended radio-loud AGN from the LOFAR Two-Metre Sky Survey (LoTSS)
  * 在LOFAR数据下，射电光度不能简单预测FR I/II的形态类型: 有很多FR II是低光度的：extending three orders of magnitude below the traditional FR break, and demonstrate that their host galaxies are on average systematically fainter than those of high-luminosity FRIIs and of FRIs matched in luminosity. 
  * low-power jets may remain undisrupted and form hotspots in lower mass hosts.
  * 还有很多不能简单分类的hybrid类型：we identify 459 bent-tailed sources, which we find to have a significantly higher SDSS cluster association fraction (at z<0.4) than the general radio-galaxy population

* [Inferring high redshift large-scale structure dynamics from the Lyman-alpha forest](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.02973)
  * We present a fully Bayesian approach to infer the three-dimensional cosmic matter distribution and its dynamics at z>2 from observations of the Lyman-α forest.
  * 方法能unbiased的给出质量分布和各个尺度上的功率谱。
  * 但其实还是要在LOS观测中间进行差值的。。。

* [The impact of baryonic physics and massive neutrinos on weak lensing peak statistics](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.03161)
  * BAHAMAS模拟：We present the first study of weak lensing peaks in simulations that include both baryonic physics and massive neutrinos
  * As higher neutrino mass tends to suppress the formation of massive structures in the Universe, the halo mass function and lensing peak counts are therefore modified as a function of Mν
  * Over most of the S/N range, the impact of fiducial baryonic physics is greater (less) than neutrinos for 0.06 and 0.12 (0.24 and 0.48) eV models.
