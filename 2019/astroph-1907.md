* [The MOSDEF Survey: Direct-Method Metallicities and ISM Conditions at z∼1.5−3.5](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.00013)
  * MOSFIRE探测z>1星系的[OIII] 4363线：We find that strong-line calibrations based on local analogs of high-redshift galaxies reliably reproduce the metallicity of the z > 1 sample on average.
  * 但是只用直接方法得到z>1的质量-金属丰度关系的slope和强发射线方法的不一样
  * 需要用O/Fe超过太阳丰度和考虑双星演化的模型才能解释发射线

* [A new estimator for gravitational lensing using galaxy and intensity mapping surveys](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.00071)
  * Propose a new tomographic estimator for the gravitational lensing potential, based on a combination of intensity mapping (IM) and galaxy counts.
  * The estimator can be written schematically as IM×galaxy − galaxy×IM; this combination allows to greatly reduce the contamination by density-density correlations, thus isolating the lensing signal.
  * For cosmic variance dominated surveys the signal-to-noise ratio is improved by a factor of around 20-30 on linear scales (ℓmax=200), with a lower improvement of around 5-10 if one includes smaller scales (ℓmax=1000). 

* [Chandra observation of a cold front in Abell 2554](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.00499)
  * We confirm that A2554 is a dynamically disturbed system. We detect two dominant structures; a main cluster at z = 0.1108 and a foreground northern substructure at z = 0.1082
  * 在距离星系团中心60kpc出有一个X-ray面亮度的不连续，consistent with the definition of a cold front with a Mach number M=0.94 
  * If the northern substructure was not related to the cold front, we conclude that the transonic motion of the cloud is caused by a merger, which was weak or occurred long ago.
