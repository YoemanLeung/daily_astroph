    * Here we report our discovery that the stars in the two RCs show a significant (> 5.3σ) difference in CN-band strength, in stark contrast to that expected in the X-shaped bulge scenario.
    * The difference in CN abundance and the population ratio between the two RCs are comparable to those observed in GCs between the first- and later generation stars. 
        - Double RCs来自多个星族，而不是X-shape bulge
    * a significant population of stars in the Milky Way bulge were assembled from disrupted proto-GCs.
