#### [Assembling the Milky Way bulge from globular clusters: Evidence from the double red clump](https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.00004)
    * Here we report our discovery that the stars in the two RCs show a significant (> 5.3σ) difference in CN-band strength, in stark contrast to that expected in the X-shaped bulge scenario.
    * The difference in CN abundance and the population ratio between the two RCs are comparable to those observed in GCs between the first- and later generation stars. 
        - Double RCs来自多个星族，而不是X-shape bulge
    * a significant population of stars in the Milky Way bulge were assembled from disrupted proto-GCs.

    * We test the performance of DL models, trained with Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) data, on Dark Energy survey (DES) using images for a sample of 5000 galaxies with a similar redshift distribution to SDSS
    * A fast domain adaptation step, consisting in a further training with a small DES sample of galaxies (∼500-300), is enough for obtaining an accuracy > 95% and a sig- nificant improvement in the completeness and purity values.

## July 3:

#### [The stellar mass function of galaxies in Planck-selected clusters at 0.5 < z < 0.7: new constraints on the timescale and location of satellite quenching](https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.00820)
    - **Relevant**
    * study the abundance of star-forming and quiescent galaxies in a sample of 21 clusters at 0.5 < z < 0.7 by Planck
    * find that the shape of the SMF of star-forming galaxies does not depend on environment, while the SMF of quiescent galaxies has a significantly steeper low-mass slope in the clusters compared to the field
    * 环境quenching的效率： The fEQ shows no stellar-mass dependence in any environment, but it increases from 40% in the cluster outskirts to ∼ 90% in the cluster centres.
    * 在模型里，environment quenching开始的radius和作用的timescale有简并



#### [The Close AGN Reference Survey (CARS): No evidence of galaxy-scale hot outflows in two nearby AGN](https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.00839)
    * We aimed to detect hot gas bubbles that would indicate the existence of powerful, galaxy-scale outflows in our target: 但没有探测到，只能给出上限
    * highly-ionized gas structures on kpc scales are not inflated by a hot outflow in either target, and instead are likely caused by photo-ionization of pre-existing gas streams of different origins.


#### [Barlenses in the CALIFA survey: combining the photometric and stellar population analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.01092)
    - **Relevant**
    * barlenses account for a significant portion of light of photometric bulges: 说明bar对聚集中心质量很重要
    * We find that 25 ± 2% of the 1064 galaxies in the whole CALIFA sample show either X-shape or barlens feature. 光度贡献占13%左右

## July 4:

#### [On the shape and evolution of a cosmic ray regulated galaxy-wide stellar initial mass function](https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.01319)
    - **Relevant**
    * a new derivation of the shape and evolution of the integrated galaxy- wide initial mass function (IGIMF), incorporating explicitly the effects of cosmic rays (CRs) as regulators of the chemical and thermal state of the gas in the dense cores of molecular clouds.
    * we focus on the physical conditions corresponding to IGIMF shapes that are simultaneously shallower at high-mass end and steeper at the low-mass end than a Kroupa IMF. 
    * 要解释椭圆星系的alpha abundance和excess of low mass stars
    * 基本上就是设计出了一种新的IGIMF，在SFR高的时候，既能top heavy，又能bottom heavy


#### [The structure of post-starburst galaxies at 0.5<z<2: evidence for two distinct quenching routes at different epochs](https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.01325)
    * At high redshift (z > 1), PSBs are typically massive (M∗ > 10^10 M⊙), very compact and exhibit high Sérsic indices, with structures that differ significantly from their star-forming progenitors but are similar to massive passive galaxies.
    * at lower redshift (0.5 < z < 1), PSBs are generally of low mass (M∗ < 10^10 M⊙) and exhibit compact but less concentrated profiles
    * Our results suggest that high-z PSBs are an intrinsically different population to those at lower redshifts, and indicate different quenching routes are active at different epochs.


#### [ALMA CO(2-1) observations in the XUV disk of M83](https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.01373)
    * We obtained CO(2-1) observations with ALMA of a small region in a 1.5’× 3’ rectangle located at rgal = 7.85′ over a bright UV region of M83. There is no CO detection
    * We obtained CO(2-1) observations with ALMA of a small region in a 1.5’× 3’ rectangle located at rgal = 7.85′ over a bright UV region of M83. There is no CO detection


#### [Intrinsic and observed dual AGN fractions from major mergers](https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.01490)
    * 用Spiral pair major merger看并合导致的dual AGN比例


#### [The SAMI Galaxy Survey: Spatially Resolved Metallicity and Ionization Mapping](https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.01522)
    * 25个Face on spiral的SAMI数据分析：We find a weak trend of steepening metallicity gradient with galaxy stellar mass, with values ranging from -0.03 to -0.20 dex/Re
    * We find that the ionization parameter has no significant correlation with either SFR, sSFR (specific star formation rate), or metallicity.
    * We find a typical ionization parameter range of 7.0 < log(q) < 7.8 for our galaxy sample with no significant overall structure -- 电离参数变化这么大，使用金属丰度诊断的时候要格外小心


#### [Hierarchical modeling and statistical calibration for photometric redshifts](https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.01391)
    * Standard template fitting delivers interpretable models and errors, but lacks flexibility to learn inaccuracies in the observed photometry or the spectral templates
    * Machine learning addresses those issues, but requires representative training data, and the resulting models and uncertainties cannot be interpreted in the context of a physical model or outside of the training data.
    * 用一个Hierarchical Bayesian model: By optimizing the full posterior distribution of the model and solving for its (thousands of) parameters, one can perform a global statistical calibration of the data and the SED model. 在DES数据上测试

#### [Constraints on reionisation from the z=7.5 QSO ULASJ1342+0928](https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.01593)

## July 5:

#### [Optical spectroscopy of local type-1 AGN LINERs](https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.01717)
    * We study the 22 local (z < 0.025) type-1 LINERs from the Palomar Survey, on the basis of opti- cal ground- and space-based long-slit spectroscopic observations taken with TWIN/CAHA and ALFOSC/NOT.
    * We found that the broad Hα component is sometimes elusive in our ground-based spectroscopy whereas it is ubiquitous for space-based data
    * we exclude the pAGBs-stars scenario in favor of the AGN as the dominant mechanism of ionisation in these LINERs, being shocks however relevant.


#### [Disentangling the AGN and Star-Formation connection using XMM-Newton](https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.01723)
    * In this work, we use data from the X-ATLAS and XMM-XXL North fields and compile the largest X-ray sample up to date, to investigate how X-ray selected AGN affect the star-formation of their host galaxies in a wide redshift and luminosity baseline
    * Our results show a correlation between the X-ray Luminosity (LX ) and the SFR of the host galaxy, at all redshifts and luminosities spanned by our sample.
    * Our analysis reveals that the AGN enhances the star-formation of its host galaxy, when the galaxy lies below the main sequence and quenches the star-formation of the galaxy it lives in, when the host lies above the main sequence. ---> 这个结论因果有问题的样子...


#### [Stellar masses, metallicity gradients and suppressed star formation revealed in a new sample of absorption selected galaxies](https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.01755)
    * We spectroscopically confirm seven galaxies harbouring damped absorbers (a 70% success-rate)
    * Absorbing galaxies with log10[M⋆ (M⊙)] > 10 have star formation rates that are lower than predicted for the main sequence of star formation. 


#### [Investigating kpc-scale radio emission properties of narrow-line Seyfert 1 galaxies](https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.01945)
    * Using 1.4 GHz FIRST, 1.4 GHz NVSS, 327 MHz WENNS, and 150 MHz TGSS catalogues we find the radio- detection of merely ∼ 4.5 per cent (498/11101) NLS1s, with majority (407/498 ∼ 81.7 per cent) of them being RL-NLS1s.
    * We find that the most of our radio-detected NLS1s are compact (< 30 kpc), exhibit both flat as well as steep radio spectra, and are distributed across a wide range of 1.4 GHz radio luminosities
    * The diagnostic plots based on the mid-IR colours suggest that the radio emission in NLS1s is mostly powered by AGN, while nuclear star-formation may have a significant contribution in NLS1s of low radio luminosities.


#### [The Evolution of Chemical Abundance in Quasar Broad Line Region](https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.01978)
    * We find a significant correlation between quasar BLR metallicity and BH mass (bolometric luminosity) but no correlation between quasar BLR metallicity and redshift. 
    * We find quasar BLR metallicity is 0.3 ∼ 1.0 dex higher than their host galaxies.
    * We propose a possibility that the high metallicity in quasar BLR might be caused by metal enrichment from massive star formation in the nucleus region of quasars or even the accretion disk.


#### [Azimuthal variations of gas-phase oxygen abundance in NGC 2997](https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.02043)
    * Here, we report the discovery of pronounced azimuthal variations of H ii region oxygen abundance in NGC 2997, a spiral galaxy at approximately 11.3 Mpc
    * We find 0.06 dex azimuthal variations in the oxygen abundance on top of a radial abundance gradient that is comparable to those seen in other star-forming disks.
    * 在旋臂上更高，在臂间更低


#### [Bayesian bulge-disc decomposition of galaxy images](https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.02097)
    - **Relevant, Important**
    * We introduce PHI, a fully Bayesian Markov-chain Monte Carlo algorithm designed for the structural decomposition of galaxy images.
    * In two-component bulge+disc galaxies we find that the bulge structural parameters are recovered less well than those of the disc, particularly when the bulge contributes a lower fraction to the luminosity
