#### [Assembling the Milky Way bulge from globular clusters: Evidence from the double red clump](https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.00004)
    * Here we report our discovery that the stars in the two RCs show a significant (> 5.3σ) differen
    * ce in CN-band strength, in stark contrast to that expected in the X-shaped bulge scenario.
    * The difference in CN abundance and the population ratio between the two RCs are comparable to those observed in GCs between the first- and later generation stars. 
        - Double RCs来自多个星族，而不是X-shape bulge
    * a significant population of stars in the Milky Way bulge were assembled from disrupted proto-GCs.


#### [The Detection of Intergalactic Halpha Emission from the Slug Nebula at z~2.3](https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.00054)
    * Slug Nebular: Characterized by high surface brightnesses over intergalactic scales, its Lyα emission may either trace high-density ionized gas (“clumps”) or large column densities of neutral material.
    * 可以用Halpha line区分这两种情况：用MOSFIRE的观测
    * Our measurements argue for the origin of the Lyα emission being recombination radiation, suggesting the presence of high-density ionized gas. 
    * our high-resolution spectroscopic study of the Lyα emission does not show evidence of a rotating disk pattern and suggest a more complex origin for at least some parts of the Slug Nebula.


#### [The Kinematics of Extended Lyman-alpha Emission in a Low Mass, Low Metallicity Galaxy at z = 2.3](https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.00065)
    - Chen Yu-Guang
    * Lyα halo of Q2343-BX418, a low mass (M⋆ = 5×10^8 M⊙), low metallicity (Z ≈ 0.25 Z⊙) star-forming galaxy at z = 2.3 的KCWI观测
    * we detect Lyα in emission to a radius of 23 kpc, and measure an exponential scale length of 6 kpc in the outer region of the extended halo.
    * Lyman alpha线双峰，且两个peak的间距和比例随位置变化：these observations are consistent with a model in which the peak ratio is largely determined by the radial component of the outflow velocity

#### [The Probability Distribution Function of Gas Surface Density in M33](https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.00166)
    * The probability distribution functions (PDFs) for atomic, molecular, and total gas surface densities are determined at a resolution of about 50 pc from available HI and CO emission line data
    * Most of the total gas PDFs from the central region to the edge of the star-forming disk are well-fitted by log-normal functions whose width decreases radially outwards.
    * HI气体速度弥散度在整个盘上都差不多；在large radius上，turbulent ISM的Mach数更低，更多的HI气体处于Warm phase
    * The molecular gas PDFs do not show strong deviations from log-normal functions in the central region where molecular fractions are high
    * Southern spiral arm和dense filament上的分子气体的PDF是power law的 --> Self-gravity dominance


#### [Investigation of dust attenuation and star formation activity in galaxies hosting GRBs](https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.00635)
    * The most extinguished GRBs are preferentially found in the more massive hosts and the UV bump is preferentially found in the most extinguished GRB l.o.s. 
    * We find a great variety in the derived attenuation curves of GRBHs, the UV slope can be similar, flatter or even steeper than the extinction curve slope. Half of the attenuation curves are consistent with the Calzetti attenuation law and there is evidence of a UV bump in only one GRBH.
    * We find that the flatter (steeper) attenuation curves are found in galaxies with the highest (lowest) SFR and stellar masses.


#### [Tidally induced bars in gas-rich dwarf galaxies orbiting the Milky Way](https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.00674)
    * Dwarf围着大质量星系引力势orbit的模拟：In all cases bars of similar length formed in the stellar disk of the dwarfs at the first pericenter passage. However, unexpectedly, the gaseous component remained approximately axisymmetric and unaffected by the bar potential.
    * When the bar is spun up by the tidal force torque, it is also shortened. Conversely, if it is slowed down, it gets longer.
    * In the models with a low gas fraction the bars were more pronounced and survived until the end of the simulations, while in the dwarfs with a high gas fraction the bars were destroyed after the second or third pericenter passage. 


#### [On the observational diagnostics to separate classical and disk-like bulges](https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.00806)
    - **Relevant**
    * We argue that the bulge Sérsic index is a poor diagnostics to discriminate different bulge types.
    * We find that the combination of line-strength with either kinematic or photometric diagnostics does not provide a clear separation for half of the sample bulges.
    * All bulges turn out to be thick oblate spheroids, but only one has a flattening consistent with that expected for outer disks.


#### [Knowledge transfer of Deep Learning for galaxy morphology from one survey to another](https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.00807)
    * We test the performance of DL models, trained with Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) data, on Dark Energy survey (DES) using images for a sample of 5000 galaxies with a similar redshift distribution to SDSS
    * A fast domain adaptation step, consisting in a further training with a small DES sample of galaxies (∼500-300), is enough for obtaining an accuracy > 95% and a sig- nificant improvement in the completeness and purity values.


#### [Lyα emitters in a cosmological volume I: the impact of radiative transfer](https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.00006)
    * Here we develop a physically-motivated scheme to predict LAEs in cosmological simulations. The escape of Lyα photons is computed using a Monte Carlo radiative transfer code which outputs a Lyα escape fraction.
    * The Lyα photons escape through an outflowing neutral gas medium, implemented assuming different geometries. 
    * Our full models populate LAEs in less massive haloes than what is obtained with abundance matching.


#### [Constraining the Stellar Mass Function from the Deficiency of Tidal Disruption Flares in the Nuclei of Massive Galaxies](https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.00029)
    * The rate of tidal disruption flares (TDFs) per mass of the disrupting black hole encodes information on the present-day mass function (PDMF) of stars in the clusters surrounding super massive black holes.
    * 用TDF rate对SMBH质量的依赖看星团的PDMF，对黑洞自旋只有很小的依赖
    * We show that existing data can marginally constrain the minimum and maximum masses of stars in the cluster, and the high- mass end of the PDMF slope, as well as the overall TDF rate. 


#### [A new powerful and highly variable disk wind in an AGN-star forming galaxy, the case of MCG-03-58-007](https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.00548)
    * Discovery of a new candidate for a fast disk wind, in the nearby Seyfert 2 galaxy MCG-03-58-007
    * two deep absorption troughs at E = 7.4 ± 0.1 keV and E = 8.5 ± 0.2 keV. 对应蓝移的Fe XXVI线，可以用告诉，高度电离，高柱密度的outflow absorber解释
    * The presence of the lower velocity component of the disk wind is independently confirmed by the analysis of a follow-up XMM-Newton & NuSTAR observation 


#### [Polarimetric and spectroscopic study of radio-quiet weak emission line quasars](https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.00630)
    * A small subset of optically selected radio-quiet quasars showing weak or no emission lines may turn out to be the elusive radio-quiet BL Lac objects, or simply be radio- quiet QSOs with a still-forming/shielded broad line region (BLR) --> 如果是BL Lac，应该有很高的偏振

## July 3:

#### [The stellar mass function of galaxies in Planck-selected clusters at 0.5 < z < 0.7: new constraints on the timescale and location of satellite quenching](https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.00820)
    - **Relevant**
    * study the abundance of star-forming and quiescent galaxies in a sample of 21 clusters at 0.5 < z < 0.7 by Planck
    * find that the shape of the SMF of star-forming galaxies does not depend on environment, while the SMF of quiescent galaxies has a significantly steeper low-mass slope in the clusters compared to the field
    * 环境quenching的效率： The fEQ shows no stellar-mass dependence in any environment, but it increases from 40% in the cluster outskirts to ∼ 90% in the cluster centres.
    * 在模型里，environment quenching开始的radius和作用的timescale有简并



#### [The Close AGN Reference Survey (CARS): No evidence of galaxy-scale hot outflows in two nearby AGN](https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.00839)
    * We aimed to detect hot gas bubbles that would indicate the existence of powerful, galaxy-scale outflows in our target: 但没有探测到，只能给出上限
    * highly-ionized gas structures on kpc scales are not inflated by a hot outflow in either target, and instead are likely caused by photo-ionization of pre-existing gas streams of different origins.


#### [Barlenses in the CALIFA survey: combining the photometric and stellar population analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.01092)
    - **Relevant**
    * barlenses account for a significant portion of light of photometric bulges: 说明bar对聚集中心质量很重要
    * We find that 25 ± 2% of the 1064 galaxies in the whole CALIFA sample show either X-shape or barlens feature. 光度贡献占13%左右

## July 4:

#### [On the shape and evolution of a cosmic ray regulated galaxy-wide stellar initial mass function](https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.01319)
    - **Relevant**
    * a new derivation of the shape and evolution of the integrated galaxy- wide initial mass function (IGIMF), incorporating explicitly the effects of cosmic rays (CRs) as regulators of the chemical and thermal state of the gas in the dense cores of molecular clouds.
    * we focus on the physical conditions corresponding to IGIMF shapes that are simultaneously shallower at high-mass end and steeper at the low-mass end than a Kroupa IMF. 
    * 要解释椭圆星系的alpha abundance和excess of low mass stars
    * 基本上就是设计出了一种新的IGIMF，在SFR高的时候，既能top heavy，又能bottom heavy


#### [The structure of post-starburst galaxies at 0.5<z<2: evidence for two distinct quenching routes at different epochs](https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.01325)
    * At high redshift (z > 1), PSBs are typically massive (M∗ > 10^10 M⊙), very compact and exhibit high Sérsic indices, with structures that differ significantly from their star-forming progenitors but are similar to massive passive galaxies.
    * at lower redshift (0.5 < z < 1), PSBs are generally of low mass (M∗ < 10^10 M⊙) and exhibit compact but less concentrated profiles
    * Our results suggest that high-z PSBs are an intrinsically different population to those at lower redshifts, and indicate different quenching routes are active at different epochs.


#### [ALMA CO(2-1) observations in the XUV disk of M83](https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.01373)
    * We obtained CO(2-1) observations with ALMA of a small region in a 1.5’× 3’ rectangle located at rgal = 7.85′ over a bright UV region of M83. There is no CO detection
    * We obtained CO(2-1) observations with ALMA of a small region in a 1.5’× 3’ rectangle located at rgal = 7.85′ over a bright UV region of M83. There is no CO detection


#### [Intrinsic and observed dual AGN fractions from major mergers](https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.01490)
    * 用Spiral pair major merger看并合导致的dual AGN比例


#### [The SAMI Galaxy Survey: Spatially Resolved Metallicity and Ionization Mapping](https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.01522)
    * 25个Face on spiral的SAMI数据分析：We find a weak trend of steepening metallicity gradient with galaxy stellar mass, with values ranging from -0.03 to -0.20 dex/Re
    * We find that the ionization parameter has no significant correlation with either SFR, sSFR (specific star formation rate), or metallicity.
    * We find a typical ionization parameter range of 7.0 < log(q) < 7.8 for our galaxy sample with no significant overall structure -- 电离参数变化这么大，使用金属丰度诊断的时候要格外小心


#### [Hierarchical modeling and statistical calibration for photometric redshifts](https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.01391)
    * Standard template fitting delivers interpretable models and errors, but lacks flexibility to learn inaccuracies in the observed photometry or the spectral templates
    * Machine learning addresses those issues, but requires representative training data, and the resulting models and uncertainties cannot be interpreted in the context of a physical model or outside of the training data.
    * 用一个Hierarchical Bayesian model: By optimizing the full posterior distribution of the model and solving for its (thousands of) parameters, one can perform a global statistical calibration of the data and the SED model. 在DES数据上测试

#### [Constraints on reionisation from the z=7.5 QSO ULASJ1342+0928](https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.01593)
    * we quantify the presence of Lyα damping wing absorption from the EoR in the spectrum of ULASJ1342+0928.
    * 用Bayesian模型同时考虑了QSO本征辐射的不确定性和再电离时期的HII分布 (使用了大数值模拟)

## July 5:

#### [Optical spectroscopy of local type-1 AGN LINERs](https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.01717)
    * We study the 22 local (z < 0.025) type-1 LINERs from the Palomar Survey, on the basis of opti- cal ground- and space-based long-slit spectroscopic observations taken with TWIN/CAHA and ALFOSC/NOT.
    * We found that the broad Hα component is sometimes elusive in our ground-based spectroscopy whereas it is ubiquitous for space-based data
    * we exclude the pAGBs-stars scenario in favor of the AGN as the dominant mechanism of ionisation in these LINERs, being shocks however relevant.


#### [Disentangling the AGN and Star-Formation connection using XMM-Newton](https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.01723)
    * In this work, we use data from the X-ATLAS and XMM-XXL North fields and compile the largest X-ray sample up to date, to investigate how X-ray selected AGN affect the star-formation of their host galaxies in a wide redshift and luminosity baseline
    * Our results show a correlation between the X-ray Luminosity (LX ) and the SFR of the host galaxy, at all redshifts and luminosities spanned by our sample.
    * Our analysis reveals that the AGN enhances the star-formation of its host galaxy, when the galaxy lies below the main sequence and quenches the star-formation of the galaxy it lives in, when the host lies above the main sequence. ---> 这个结论因果有问题的样子...


#### [Stellar masses, metallicity gradients and suppressed star formation revealed in a new sample of absorption selected galaxies](https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.01755)
    * We spectroscopically confirm seven galaxies harbouring damped absorbers (a 70% success-rate)
    * Absorbing galaxies with log10[M⋆ (M⊙)] > 10 have star formation rates that are lower than predicted for the main sequence of star formation. 


#### [Investigating kpc-scale radio emission properties of narrow-line Seyfert 1 galaxies](https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.01945)
    * Using 1.4 GHz FIRST, 1.4 GHz NVSS, 327 MHz WENNS, and 150 MHz TGSS catalogues we find the radio- detection of merely ∼ 4.5 per cent (498/11101) NLS1s, with majority (407/498 ∼ 81.7 per cent) of them being RL-NLS1s.
    * We find that the most of our radio-detected NLS1s are compact (< 30 kpc), exhibit both flat as well as steep radio spectra, and are distributed across a wide range of 1.4 GHz radio luminosities
    * The diagnostic plots based on the mid-IR colours suggest that the radio emission in NLS1s is mostly powered by AGN, while nuclear star-formation may have a significant contribution in NLS1s of low radio luminosities.


#### [The Evolution of Chemical Abundance in Quasar Broad Line Region](https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.01978)
    * We find a significant correlation between quasar BLR metallicity and BH mass (bolometric luminosity) but no correlation between quasar BLR metallicity and redshift. 
    * We find quasar BLR metallicity is 0.3 ∼ 1.0 dex higher than their host galaxies.
    * We propose a possibility that the high metallicity in quasar BLR might be caused by metal enrichment from massive star formation in the nucleus region of quasars or even the accretion disk.


#### [Azimuthal variations of gas-phase oxygen abundance in NGC 2997](https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.02043)
    * Here, we report the discovery of pronounced azimuthal variations of H ii region oxygen abundance in NGC 2997, a spiral galaxy at approximately 11.3 Mpc
    * We find 0.06 dex azimuthal variations in the oxygen abundance on top of a radial abundance gradient that is comparable to those seen in other star-forming disks.
    * 在旋臂上更高，在臂间更低


#### [Bayesian bulge-disc decomposition of galaxy images](https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.02097)
    - **Relevant, Important**
    * We introduce PHI, a fully Bayesian Markov-chain Monte Carlo algorithm designed for the structural decomposition of galaxy images.
    * In two-component bulge+disc galaxies we find that the bulge structural parameters are recovered less well than those of the disc, particularly when the bulge contributes a lower fraction to the luminosity

## July 8:

#### [Faraday rotation maps of disk galaxies](https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.02113)
    * Here we compute synthetic Faraday rotation maps at z = 0 for a set of disk galaxies from the Auriga high-resolution cosmological simulations
    * We also find that the structure and angular power spectra of the synthetic all-sky Faraday rotation maps vary strongly with azimuthal position along the solar circle.
    * Radial and vertical magnetic field components that are only ordered on scales of a few kpc.
    * This represents a severe obstacle for attempts to reconstruct the global magnetic field of the Milky Way from Faraday rotation maps alone without including additional observables.


#### [Testing the Breathing Mode in Intermediate Mass Galaxies and its Predicted Star Formation Rate-Size Anti-Correlation](https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.02118)
    - **Relevant**
    * One prediction of this quasi-periodic, galactic-scale “breathing” is an anti-correlation between star formation rate (SFR) and half-light radius as central gas overdensities lead to starbursts whose feedback drags stars to larger radii while star formation dwindles.
    * 用COSMOS星系来测试：中等质量, 0.3<z<0.4，sSFR越高，size越大，越disk dominated
        - 和模拟里给出的breathing model不一样


#### [Metallicity gradients in the globular cluster systems of early-type galaxies: In-situ and accreted components?](https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.02142)
    - **Relevant, Important**
    * The gradients in the metal-rich and metal-poor GC subpopulations are the same, within measurement uncertainties, in a given galaxy. 
    * These GC gradients are similar in strength to the stellar metallicity gradient of the host galaxy
    * At the very largest radii (e.g. greater than 8 galaxy effective radii) there is some evidence that the GC gradients become flat with near constant mean metallicity.
    * We conclude that although metal-rich GCs are predominately formed during the in-situ phase and metal-poor GCs during the accretion phase of massive galaxy formation, they do not have a strict one-to-one connection.


#### [Weak-lensing shear measurement with machine learning: teaching artificial neural networks about feature noise](https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.02120)
    * Crucially, the shear measurement must address and compensate for a range of interwoven nuisance effects related to the instrument optics and detector, noise in the images, unknown galaxy morphologies, colors, blending of sources, and selection effects.
    * We present a simple architecture that learns to regress shear point estimates and weights via shallow artificial neural networks. The networks are trained on simulations of the forward observing process, and take combinations of moments of the galaxy images as inputs.
    * To address this issue, the proposed training algorithm minimizes bias over multiple realizations of individual source galaxies, reducing the sensitivity to properties of the overall sample of source galaxies.


#### [Parsec-scale radio structure of 14 Fanaroff-Riley type 0 radio galaxies](https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.02505)
    * Compact Radio Source: FR0
    * The radio properties of fourteen FR 0s on parsec (pc) scales derived from their very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) imaging observations.
    * Four sources show relativistic beaming with Doppler boosting factors ranging from 1.7 to 6.
    * The radio properties of the FR 0s inferred from the VLBI data resemble GHz-peaked spectrum or compact steep-spectrum sources.

    * We present two ConvNet lens-finders which we have trained with a dataset composed of real galaxies from the Kilo Degree Survey (KiDS) and simulated lensed sources.
    * In particular, the single-band ConvNet can select a sample of lens candidates with ∼ 50% purity, retrieving 3 out of 4 of the confirmed gravitational lenses in the LRG sample


#### [Velocity-resolved reverberation mapping of five bright Seyfert 1 galaxies](https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.4784)
    * 一批AGN的反响映射成图，除了定黑洞质量外，to look for velocity-dependent time delays that might be indicators of the gross kinematics of the broad-line region.
    * We observe velocity dependent Hβ lags in each case, and find that the patterns have changed in the intervening five years for three AGNs that were also observed in 2007.


#### [Deep LOFAR 150 MHz imaging of the Boötes field: Unveiling the faint low-frequency sky](https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.4878)
    * LOw Frequency ARray (LOFAR) at 120-168 MHz of the Boötes field 巡天，10091射电源 (150MHz=1.998 meter)
    * The derived 150 MHz source counts present a flattening below sub-mJy flux densities, that is in agreement with previous results from high- and low- frequency surveys. This flattening has been argued to be due to an increasing contribution of star-forming galaxies and faint active galactic nuclei.


#### [Luminosity Profiles of Prominent Stellar Halos](https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.4922)
    - **Relevant**
    * 54个侧向盘星系，有很明显的halo结构
    * A single Sersic profile fitted to the surface brightness along the minor-axis of the disk shows a luminosity excess in the central regions for the majority of sample galaxies. This central excess is considered to be caused by the central bulge component
    * There is a weak tendency of increasing n with increasing luminosity and central velocity dispersion, but there is no dependence on the local background density


#### [Predictably Missing Satellites: Subhalo Abundance in Milky Way-like Halos](https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.5180)
    * Motivated by recent studies that identified ways in which the Milky Way is atypical (e.g., Licquia et al. 2015), we investigate how the properties of dark matter halos with mass comparable to our Galaxy’s — including concentration, spin, shape, and scale factor of the last major merger — correlate with the subhalo abundance.
    * Concentration is the most informative single parameter for predicting subhalo abundance. 
    * 用模拟看，银河系的subhalo abundance应当比类似的Vmax halo少一些


#### [The XXL Survey: XVI. The clustering of X-ray selected galaxy clusters at z~0.3](https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.04760)
    - **Relevant**
    * We measured the angle-averaged two-point correlation function of the XXL cluster sample. 
    * The XXL cluster clustering appears fully consistent with standard cosmological predictions. The analysis presented in this work demonstrates the feasibility of a cosmological exploitation of the XXL cluster clustering

#### [A Robust Tip of the Red Giant Branch Distance to the Fireworks Galaxy (NGC 6946)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.05229)
    * We employ a Bayesian maximum-likelihood modeling method that incorporates the completeness of the photometry, and allows us to model the luminosity function of the RGB population.
    * Our final distance of 7.72 ± 0.32 Mpc is higher than most values published previously in the literature. 
    * 这个星系里有10个观测到的超新星


#### [Λ CDM Predictions for the Satellite Population of M33](https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.05318)
    * M33也应该有几个自己的卫星，但没有观测到：This ‘satellites of satellites’ hierarchy has recently been explored in the context of the dwarf galaxies discovered around the Milky Way’s Magellanic Clouds in the Dark Energy Survey. 
    * If M33 is on its first infall into M31’s halo, its proposed satellites are expected to remain bound to M33 today. However, if M33 experienced a recent tidal interaction with M31, the number of surviving satellites depends strongly on the distance achieved at pericenter due to the effects of tidal stripping.


#### [A highly magnified gravitationally lensed red quasar at z = 2.5 with significant flux anomaly: Uncovering a missing population](https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.05434)
    * The discovery of a gravitationally lensed dust-reddened QSO at z = 2.517 discovered in a survey for red QSOs by infrared selection.
    * We find that compared to the central image of the cusp, the nearby, brightest image is anomalous by a factor of ∼ 7 − 11. Although the source is extremely bright in the mid-infrared, a magnification by a factor of ∼ 50 − 120 places an upper limit of 1.35 mJy on the intrinsic mid-infrared brightnes


#### [SHARP - V. Modelling gravitationally-lensed radio arcs imaged with global VLBI observations](https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.05566)
    * We present milliarcsecond (mas) angular resolution observations of the gravitationally lensed radio source MG J0751+2716 (at z = 3.2) obtained with global Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) at 1.65 GH
    * By identifying compact sub-components in the multiple images, we constrain the mass distribution of the foreground z = 0.35 gravi- tational lens using analytic models: find an inner mass-density slope steeper than isothermal for the main lensing galaxy
    * We find randomly distributed image position residuals of about 3 mas, which are much larger that the measurement errors (40 μas on average). 在mas精度上，smooth质量分布假设不正确

    * 模拟研究z=10的一个星系里面的100 Msun的黑洞在不同情况下的质量增长
    * We find that, within the limits of our model, BH seeds cannot grow by more than 30%, suggesting that accretion on light-seed models are inadequate to explain high-z SMBH. 
    * 早期黑洞会用X-ray假设IGM，也许会在HI 21cm的功率谱里面留下信号

#### [AutoSpec: Fast Automated Spectral Extraction Software for IFU Datacubes](https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.05922)
    * However, a great deal of information available within these datacubes is overlooked in favor of photometrically based spatial information
    * Further, implementing our custom designed algorithms also improves the signal-to-noise of the extracted spectra and successfully deblends sources from nearby contaminants


#### [Are NLS1s highly accreting low black hole mass AGNs?](https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.05260)
    * To test this, we use a sample of 35 NLS1s and 54 BLS1s with similar X-ray luminosity distributions and good XMM-Newton observations.
    * 用X-ray scaling relation得到黑洞质量
    * On average, NLS1s have lower BH masses, but the difference between the average MBH of NLS1s and BLS1s in our sample is only marginally significant
    * Even stronger differences between NLS1s and BLS1s are inferred when the accretion rate distributions of NLS1s are compared to BLS1s, suggesting that the two populations are indeed distinct
