## Mass-richness calibration

#### Murata et al. 2019: The mass–richness relation of optically selected clusters from weak gravitational lensing and abundance with Subaru HSC first-year data
    * 1747 CAMIRA clusters in S16A at 0.1<z<1.0 with N>15
    * Jointly constraint using abundance and weak lensing profiles.
    * About CAMIRA catalog:
        - The richness corresponds to the number of red member galaxies with stellar mass $M_{\star} > 10^{10.2} M_{\odot}$ ($> 0.2 L_{\star}$) in 1 Mpc.
        - CAMIRA algorithm does not include a richness-dependent scale radius to define the richness, unlike the redMaPPer algorithm
        - The HSC images are deep enough to detect cluster member galaxies down to M∗ ∼ 10^10.2 M⊙ even at a cluster redshift $z_{\rm cl} \sim 1$
        - The CAMIRA algorithm identifies a brightest cluster galaxy (BCG) for each cluster candidate that is defined by a peak in the three-dimensional richness map in RA, Dec, and redshift space
    * About the off-center BCGs:
        - The identified BCGs as cluster centers can be off-centered from the true halo centers (e.g., Lin et al. 2004; Rozo & Rykoff 2014; Oguri 2014; Oguri et al. 2018a).
        - Oguri et al. (2018a) investigated the offset distribution of centers detected using the CAMIRA algorithm from centers of matched X-ray clus- ters, and showed that in most cases the offset is less than $0.5 h^{−1}$ Mpc in physical transverse distances

#### Murata et al. 2018: Constraints on the Mass–Richness Relation from the Abundance and Weak Lensing of SDSS Clusters
    * 8312 SDSS redMaPPer clusters with 20 < λ < 100 and 0.10 < zλ <0.33.
    * We find that a large scatter in halo masses is required at the lowest-richness bins in order to reproduce the measurements
    * 在$3 \times 10^{14} h^{-1} M_{\odot}$处，$\ln \lambda$的scatter是0.46 dex.
    * 如果不考虑很高的scatter，模型会高估DSigma profile
