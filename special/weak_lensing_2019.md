* Planck + Different WL surveys, tension is real.
* Raveri & Hu 2018: What is tension? or consistency
    - Concordance and Discordance in Cosmology
* The Universe is much different at the last scattering
    - Unusual dark energy properties / modified gravity / early Universe physics
* New data could sharpen or resolve the tension
    - 2PCF from larger area / better modeling / beyond 2PCF
* Shear 2PCF --> S/N approaching 100
* Tomography: the evolution of S8: Chang + 2018 (DES)
* Combined approach:
    - galaxy positions; galaxy shear; CMB lensing --> 6 different 2PCF
    - 5 x 2pt
    - SZ contamination of CMB lensing map / small scale issues / cosmic infrared map
* DES Y1: combined with CMB lensing, able to test the calibration and improved parameter constraints

* Multi-probe: independent observations; multiple likelihood
* Large list of systematics + nuisance parameters
    - galaxies: LF, bias
    - cluster mass-observable relation
    - shear calibration, photo-z uncertainties, IA
* DES Y1, marginalization over 20 parameters
    - linear bias of lens galaxies; photo-z of lens and source; IA
    - "stress-test" parameters; test of prior choices
* Blinding analysis:
    - Two stages; only blind to cosmology parameters
    - Null tests are essential
    - Shear catalogs scaled by unknown factor
    - Cosmological parameters shifted
* DES Y1: Most stringent constraint today
    - WL is consistent with galaxy clustering
* LSST: 1809.01669
    - prepare the known systematics
    - For data, need to define the data vector clearly
    - Besides multiple probes, could use different observables from the same data or split the data
* Unknown systematics or new physics?
    - Dependence on scale, galaxy/cluster selection, use better calibration


* Galaxy-Lensing Cross-Correlation: Sukhdeep Singh
    - Robust to additive lensing bias
    - Galaxy lensing --> difficult to model, including small scale physics
    - Using ADSD estimator: remove information from scale < r0
    - Lower impact of non-linear bias, baryon effects, RSD, galaxy-matter correlation
    - But remove some data, so lower S/N
* BOSS LOWZ x SDSS lensing; or BOSS CMASS x Planck lensing
* Clustering + lensing breaks bias-sigma8 degeneracy
