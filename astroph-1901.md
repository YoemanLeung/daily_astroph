#### [Space Telescope and Optical Reverberation Mapping Project. X. The Hidden Life of "the Obscurer" in NGC 5548 and Understanding the Absorption-Line Holiday](https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.11578)
    * The Space Telescope and Optical Reverberation Mapping Project (AGN STORM) on NGC 5548 in 2014 is the most intensive multi-wavelength AGN monitoring campaign ever.
    * The lines varied independently of the observed UV-optical continuum during a 60 -- 70 day "holiday."
    * In our model, variations in this obscurer's line-of-sight covering factor modify the soft X-ray continuum. This leads to changes in the ionization of helium gas in the broad-line region.


#### [The SAMI Galaxy Survey: Exploring the gas-phase Mass-Metallicity Relation](https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.11263)
    * we do not find any significant secondary relation of the MZR with either the star formation rate (SFR) nor the specific SFR (SFR/Mass) for any of the calibrators used in this study
    * if there is a dependence with the SFR, it is weaker than the reported one, it is confined to the low mass regime (M*<10^9Msun) or high SFR regimes


#### [Galaxy assembly bias of central galaxies in the Illustris simulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.11210)
    * Galaxy stellar mass Mstar is found to have a tighter correlation with peak maximum halo circular velocity Vpeak than with halo mass Mh. Once the correlation with Vpeak is accounted for, Mstar has nearly no dependence on any other halo assembly variables.

#### [Near-Infrared Survey and Photometric Redshifts in the Extended GOODS-North field](https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.00013)
    * WIRCam拍的GOODS-N的J和H图像; 更好的Photo-z，尤其是加了GALEX的UV数据后
    * we cross-matched our catalog with the updated 2M-CDFN X-ray catalog from Xue et al. (2016) and found that 658 out of 683 X-ray sources have counterparts.


#### [WALLABY Early Science - II. The NGC 7232 galaxy group](https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.00241)
    * 36 beams to map a field of view of 30 square degrees.
    * we detect 17 HI sources. Eleven of these detections are identified as galaxies and have stellar counterparts, of which five are newly resolved HI galaxy sources. The other six detections appear to be tidal debris in the form of HI clouds that are associated with the central triplet, NGC 7232/3, comprising the spiral galaxies NGC 7232, NGC7232B and NGC7233
    * The remaining HI clouds are likely transient tidal knots that are possibly part of a diffuse tidal bridge between NGC 7232/3 and another group member, the lenticular galaxy IC 5181.

#### [Detecting Dark Matter Cores in Galaxy Clusters with Strong Lensing](https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.00507)
    * modeling a cluster halo with ellipticity in the gravitational potential can bias the inferred mass and concentration, which may bias the inferred central density when weak lensing or X-ray data are added.
    * 如果真的density profile和假设不符合，也会引起spurious detection of core的可能
    * Central image 对定模型特别关键
    * Applying our methodology to Abell 611 and imposing a reasonable prior on the stellar mass-to-light ratio restricts the core size to be less than about 4 kpc

#### [Analysis of the spatially-resolved V-3.6um colors and dust extinction in 257 nearby NGC and IC galaxies](https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.00565)
    * spatially-resolved maps for the observed V and g to 3.6um flux ratios and the inferred dust extinction values, A_V, for a sample of 257 nearby NGC and IC galaxies.  SDSS+Spitzer
    * By applying the "Beta_V method" (Tamura et al. 2009, 2010), which was recently calibrated as a function of redshift and morphological type by Kim et al. (2017), dust extinction maps for each galaxy were created.
    * We highlight noticeably redder V-3.6um colors in the center of star-forming galaxies and galaxies with a weak AGN.

#### [Dynamical Histories of the Crater II and Hercules Dwarf Galaxies](https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.00594)
    * 考察这两个UFD之前被银河系strip的可能性; 通过成员星得到速度弥散度，质光比，和金属丰度
    * Crater II在动力学冷的DM halo中;
    * Given the available kinematic data, we find a probability of ∼ 40% that Hercules has suffered tidal stripping. The proper motion of Crater II makes it almost certain to be stripped.


#### [CO Multi-line Imaging of Nearby Galaxies (COMING). VII. Fourier decomposition of molecular gas velocity fields and bar pattern speed](https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.00640)
    * On average, the investigated barred (SAB and SB) galaxies exhibit a ratio of noncircular to circular velocities of molecular gas larger by a factor of 1.5-2 than non-barred (SA) spiral galaxies at radii within the bar semimajor axis ab at 1 kpc
    * this trend is caused by kpc-scale streaming motions of molecular gas in the bar region.

#### [Bar properties and photometry of barred low surface brightness disc galaxies](https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.00762)
    * We find that bars in LSBs are shorter and weaker when compared with those in HSBs galaxies.
    * We also find that bars in LSBs have comparable relative bar pattern speeds to those in HSBs, the majority of which we find to be ‘fast’ (i.e. R < 1.4).
    * n general, we find that our barred LSBs have comparable central surface brightnesses and total magnitudes to unbarred LSBs, albeit slightly brighter.

#### [The Data Analysis Pipeline for the SDSS-IV MaNGA IFU Galaxy Survey: Overview](https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.00856)
    * For DR15, these measurements include stellar kinematics (velocity and velocity dispersion), emission-line properties (kinematics, fluxes, and equivalent widths), and spectral indices (e.g., D4000 and the Lick indices).
    * 关于匹配 spectral resolution 的 appendix很有用

#### [The Data Analysis Pipeline for the SDSS-IV MaNGA IFU Galaxy Survey: Emission-Line Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.00866)
    * some have suggested that shielding of dense gas by dust grains is the key factor enabling the presence of both. We present a sub-grid model for use in galaxy formation simulations in which star formation is linked explicitly to local dust shielding.
    * We find that the shielding-based model allows for star formation at higher temperatures and lower densities than a model in which star formation is tied directly to H2 abundance
    * However, the resulting galaxies are very similar for both the shielding and H2-based star formation models, and both models reproduce the resolved Kennicutt-Schmidt law.


#### [The Data Analysis Pipeline for the SDSS-IV MaNGA IFU Galaxy Survey: Emission-Line Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.00866)
    * We describe the algorithmic choices made in the DAP with regards to measuring emission-line properties, and the effect of our adopted strategy of simultaneously fitting the continuum and line emission.
    * Stellar template很重要：In particular, we test the effect of using different stellar libraries and simple stellar-population models on the derived emission-line fluxes and the effect of introducing different tying prescriptions for the emission-line kinematics. We show that these effects can generate large (> 0.2 dex) discrepancies at low signal-to-noise and for lines with low equivalent width (EW); however, the combined effect is noticeable even for Hα EW > 6 Å.


#### [Ionisation of the atomic gas in redshifted radio sources](https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.00887)
    * a survey for H I 21-cm absorption at z ∼< 0.4 in a new sample of radio sources with the Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope. --> Zero detection
    * we confirm that the non-detection of 21-cm absorption in active sources at high redshift is due to photo-ionisation of the gas rather than excitation by 21-cm photons
    * We also confirm a strong correlation between the absorption strength and the reddening of the source, suggesting that dust plays a significant role in shielding the gas from the ambient ultra-violet field.


#### [High-Precision Dark Halo Virial Masses from Globular Cluster Numbers: Implications for Globular Cluster Formation and Galaxy Assembly](https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.00900)
    - **Interesting, Relevant**
    * 依然是说GC数量和Mvir之间有很好的，与星系形态无关的log-linear关系：The linearity is most simply explained as a result of hierarchical cosmological merging of a high-redshift halo seed population that hosted on average one GC per 5×10^9 M⊙ ×(1−ηsmooth) of dark matter mass.
    * 对GC瓦解这样的过程有一定的限制能力：Strong secular evolution of the GC system requires significant fine-tuning as processes like GC disruption generate non-linear correlations that are not observed.
    * GCs in dwarf satellite galaxies pose a serious problem for high-redshift GC formation scenarios. The dark halo masses of dwarf galaxies hosting GCs therefore might have been one order of magnitude larger than currently estimated.


#### [The imprint of clump formation at high redshift. I. A disc alpha-abundance dichotomy](https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.00931)
    * 关于银河系恒星a/Fe的dichotomy: Here we demonstrate that a dichotomy arises naturally if the early gas-rich disc fragments, leading to some fraction of the star formation occurring in clumps of the type observed in high-redshift galaxies.
    * These clumps have high star formation rate density. They, therefore, enrich rapidly, moving from the low-alpha to the high-alpha sequence, while more distributed star formation produces the low-alpha sequence.


#### [SEAGLE--II: Constraints on feedback models in galaxy formation from massive early type strong lens galaxies](https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.01095)
    - **Interesting**
    * 在EAGLE模拟环境下测试不同星系形成模型，尤其是Feedback，对于强引力透镜的影响 (中心质量分布profile)
    * We find significant variation in the total mass density slope at the Einstein radius and in the projected stellar mass-size relation, mainly due to different implementations of stellar and AGN feedback.
    * 要解释观测到的mass-density slope relation，需要合适的feedback模型 (Key figure 是图7)
    * 目前最合适的模型： Models in which stellar feedback becomes inefficient at high gas densities, or weaker AGN feedback with a higher duty cycle
    * the GLAMER ray-tracing pack- age (Metcalf & Petkova 2014; Petkova et al. 2014), and the LENSED lens-modeling code (Tessore et al. 2016)


#### [The HI Morphology and Stellar Properties of Strongly Barred Galaxies: support for bar quenching in massive spirals](https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.01164)
    * GMRT和VLA观测一批富气体的棒旋星系的HI分布
    * The HIRB galaxies presented here support a picture in which bar quenching is playing, or will soon play an important role in their evolution. They also support models which show how the presence of cold gas delays and slows the development of a strong bar.
    * those with the highest gas fractions show little impact from their bar on the HI morphology, and are still actively star-forming.


#### [Star Formation Stochasticity Measured from the Distribution of Burst Indicators](https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.01192)
    * We define a burst indicator (η), which compares a galaxy’s star formation rates on short (∼ 10 Myr) and long (∼ 100 Myr) timescales.
    * 用模拟中的Halpha和NUV测试：We find that the average value of η is not itself a good indicator of star formation stochasticity (burstiness); indeed we show that this average should be close to zero unless the population being studied has an average SFH which is rising or falling rapidly.
    * 但对于一族星系的η的分布的宽度却可以反映这群星系统计上的burstness; 而且对IMF和金属丰度不敏感

## Jan 7:


#### [Black hole obscuration and duty cycles mediated by AGN feedback in high redshift galaxies](https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.01261)
    * 模拟研究：We find that the feedback from the AGN efficiently controls the growth of the black hole and limits the duration of the high accretion episodes by emptying the gas reservoir.
    * As the galaxy grows in mass, the production of metals results in the presence of dust-enriched gas in the galaxy centre that can obscure highly accreting black holes enough to strongly reduce their UV/optical visibility.
    * 中心周围的尘埃一样可以产生obscuration: We suggest that this explains the different duty cycles required to explain the masses of high redshift quasars and the observed UV/optical luminosity functions

#### [The MASSIVE Survey - XII Connecting Stellar Populations of Early-Type Galaxies to Kinematics and Environment](https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.01271)
    - **Relevant, Interesting**
    * Focusing on ~R_e (~10 kpc), we find significant correlations between the abundance ratios, sigma, and M* at large radius, but we also find that the abundance ratios saturate in the highest-mass bin.
    * We see a strong correlation between the kurtosis of the line of sight velocity distribution (h4) and the stellar population parameters beyond R_e.
    * Galaxies with higher radial anisotropy appear to be older, with metal-poorer stars and enhanced [alpha/Fe]. 高的非各项同性可能来自不断吸积小星系


#### [Probing Cosmic Dawn with Emission Lines: Predicting Infrared and Nebular Line Emission for ALMA and JWST](https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.01272)
    * 模拟研究：Many of the simulated systems exhibit transient but well defined gaseous disks that appear as velocity gradients in [CII] 158.6μm emission.
    * Spatial and spectral offsets between [CII] 158.6μm and [OIII] 88.33μm are common, but not ubiquitous, as each line probes a different phase of the ISM.
    * We predict that local calibrations between Hα and [OII] 3727 ̊A luminosity and galaxy SFR apply up to z > 10, as do the local relations between certain strong line diagnostics (R23 and [OIII] 5007 ̊A/Hβ) and galaxy metallicity.


#### [Revisiting the Integrated Star Formation Law. Paper I: Non-Starbursting Galaxies](https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.01283)
    * We use new and updated gas and dust-corrected SFR surface densities to revisit the integrated star formation law for local “quiescent” spiral, dwarf, and low-surface-brightness galaxies.
    * Many dwarf galaxies lie below the star formation law defined by spirals, suggesting a low-density threshold in the integrated star formation law.
    * Our improved measurement precision also allows us to determine that much of the scatter in the star formation law is intrinsic
    * We find that dwarf galaxies exhibit second-order correlations with total gas fraction, stellar mass surface density, and dynamical time that may explain much of the scatter in the star formation law.


#### [Hadronic Interactions of Energetic Charged Particles in Protogalactic Outflow Environments and Implications for the Early Evolution of Galaxies](https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.01411)
    * 早期星系中恒星形成的外流中高能强子粒子与环境的碰撞可以加热外流，还可以被带出星系外，传递能量到CGM
    * 模拟研究：Around 10\% of the cosmic rays injected into the system can escape by advection with the outflow wind, while the remaining cosmic rays deliver an important interstellar heating effect
    * Advection and diffusion are the two main mechanisms for the transportation of high-energy charged hadronic (cosmic ray) 水平对流和扩散
        - CR heating of the ISM could lead to the distortion of the stellar initial mass function (IMF) and even quench the star formation process entirely (see Pfrommer et al. 2007b; Chen et al. 2016).


#### [Age, metallicity and star formation history of spheroidal galaxies in cluster at z~1.2](https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.01595)
    - **Relevant, Interesting**
    * XLSSJ0223 at z∼1.22中七个椭球星系的LBT光谱研究
    * We find a significant scatter in age, showing that massive spheroids, at least in our targeted cluster, are not coeval.
    * The median metallicity is [Z/H]=0.09±0.16, as for early-types in clusters at 0<z<0.9. This lack of evolution of [Z/H] over the range 0<z<1.3, corresponding to the last 9 billions years, suggests that no significant additional star formation and chemical enrichment are required for cluster spheroids to reach the present-day population.
    * We do not detect significant correlation between age and velocity dispersion σe, or dynamical mass Mdyn, or effective stellar mass density Σe.
    * the metallicity [Z/H] of the seven spheroids is correlated to their dynamical mass Mdyn, according to a relation similar to the one for local spheroids. [Z/H] is also anticorrelated to stellar mass density Σe because of the anticorrelation between Mdyn and Σe.

#### [Galaxy And Mass Assembly (GAMA): Environmental Quenching of Centrals and Satellites in Groups](https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.01640)
    - **Relevant**
    * 主要是看Quenching过程对central和satellite星系 (在相同的恒星或者Halo质量上) 是否有区别
    * Central和Satellite的quenched fraction很不一样：We also find that our passive fractions increase with both halo-to-satellite mass ratio and central-to-second rank mass ratio.
    * This suggests that quenching is more efficient in satellites that are low-mass for their halo and are more likely to be passive in older groups - forming a consistent picture of environmen- tal quenching of satellites.


#### [Interpreting the star formation - extinction relation with MaNGA](https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.01707)
    * Balmer decrement measurements imply an extinction of the Hα line emission which scales approximately linearly with the logarithm of the star formation surface density: AHα = 0.46 log(ΣSF R) + 1.53.
    * Secondary dependencies are observed such that, at a given ΣSFR, regions of lower metallicity and/or enhanced Hα equivalent width (EW) suffer less obscuration than regions of higher metallicity and/or lower Hα EW.
    * We present a simple model in which the observed trends can be accounted for by a metallicity-dependent scaling between ΣSFR and Σdust via a super- linear Kennicutt-Schmidt relation (nKS ∼ 1.47) and a dust-to-gas ratio which scales linearly with metallicity (DGR(Z⊙) = 0.01).


#### [G.A.S. II: Dust extinction in galaxies; Luminosity functions and InfraRed eXcess](https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.01747)
    * We present the complete prescription of dust attenuation implemented in the new semi-analytical model: G.A.S. 
    * Dust impact is treated by taking into account three dust components: Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons, Very Small Grains, and Big Grains. All three components evolve in both a diffuse and a fragmented/dense gas phase.
    * Our model predicts large scatters for relations based on IRX, especially for the IRX-β relation. Our analysis reveals that the slope of the attenuation curve is more driven by absolute attenuation in the FUV band than by disk inclination


#### [G.A.S. I: A prescription for turbulence-regulated star formation and its impact on galaxy properties](https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.01906)
    * The fundamental underpinning of our new model is the development of a multi-phase interstellar medium (ISM) in which energy produced by supernovae and active galaxy nuclei maintains an equilibrium between the diffuse, hot, stable gas and a cooler, clumpy, low-volume filling factor gas.
    * We show that rapid and multiple exchanges between gas phases strongly regulates star-formation rates in galaxies because only a small fraction of the unstable gas is forming stars.
    * 模型特别强调了turbulent的重要性


#### [Accurate Identification of Galaxy Mergers with Imaging](https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.01975)
    * SUNRISE模拟并合星系图像，测量得到多个参数，用LDA进行分类
    * We find that the classification depends strongly on mass ratio and depends weakly on the gas fraction of the simulated mergers; asymmetry is more important for the major mergers, while concentration is more important for the minor mergers.

#### [Data-Driven Reconstruction of Gravitationally Lensed Galaxies using Recurrent Inference Machines](https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.01359)
    *  This method treats the source as a pixelated image and utilizes the Recurrent Inference Machine (RIM) to iteratively reconstruct the background source given a lens model.

#### [High Redshift Massive Quiescent Galaxies are as Flat as Star Forming Galaxies: The Flattening of Galaxies and the Correlation with Structural Properties in CANDELS/3D-HST](https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.02009)
    - **Interesting, Relevant**
    * Quiescent galaxies at z < 1 and M∗ > 10^11M⊙ are rounder than those at lower masses, consistent with the hypothesis that they have grown significantly through dry merging.
    * The massive quiescent galaxies at higher redshift become flatter, and are as flat as star forming massive galaxies at 2.5 < z < 3.5, consistent with formation through direct transformations or wet mergers.
    * 对quiescent星系，认为背后的驱动是Sersic index随着minor merger演化；而对恒星形成星系则不是
    * Instead, the strongest predictor of q in star-forming galaxies is the effective radius, where larger galaxies are flatter.

    * observational evidence for the coherence between galaxy rotation and the average line-of-sight motion of neighbors.


#### [Quantifying star formation activity in the inner 1kpc of local MIR bright QSOs](https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.02158)
    * QSO中的恒星形成率：Mid-infrared (MIR) spectral diagnostics at high spatial resolution (∼ 0.4 arcsec) yield star formation rates (SFRs) in the inner regions (∼300 pc to 1 kpc) for 13 of 20 of the sample members.
    * Using the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) feature at 11.3 μm, we measure SFRs around 0.2 and 1.6 M⊙yr−1.
    * 在不同尺度上的测量比较发现差不多，说明SF是比较在中心集中的：inner region (  1 kpc) accounting for the majority of star formation measured on these scales
    * PAH molecules can be present in most local MIR-bright QSOs within a few hundred pc from the central engine.

    * 一维数值模拟：energy released by an AGN pushes the surrounding gas outward in a bubble until this reaches transparency. AGN episode时长五万年
    * The typical radii of 0.1 − 1 kpc, velocities of 100 − 1000 km s−1 and resulting optical depths are consistent with observations of warm absorbers.
    * AGN can feed very efficiently by agitating this surrounding dense material.


#### [Extremely Massive Quasars are not Good Proxies for Dense Environments Compared to Massive Galaxies: Environments of Extremely Massive Quasars and Galaxies](https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.02267)
    - **Interesting, Relevant**
    * Here, we study the environments of 9461 galaxies and 2943 quasars at 0.24 ≤ z ≤ 0.40, among which 52 are extremely massive quasars with log(MBH/M⊙) ≥ 9.4 
    * We find that, on average, both massive quasars and massive galaxies reside in environments more than ∼ 2 times as dense as those of their less massive counterparts with log(MBH/M⊙) > 9.0.
    * However, massive quasars reside in environments about half as dense as inactive galaxies with log(MBH/M⊙) ≥ 9.4, and only about one third of massive quasars are found in galaxy clusters


#### [AGN torus detectability at sub-millimeter wavelengths: What to expect from ALMA continuum data](https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.02280)
    * With estimated sizes of less than 10 pc, as constrained by mid-infrared high angular resolution data, only the superb spatial resolution achieved by ALMA is able to actually image this dusty structure 但是尘埃的起源还不清楚
    * 用CLUMPY模型看：We find that it is more likely to detect bigger and denser dusty tori at the highest ALMA frequency (666 GHz/450 μm).
    * 用观测的AGN的MIR+FIR SED模型拟合外推submm贡献：We combined and extrapolated both fits to compare the extrapolation of both torus and jet contributors at sub-mm wavelengths with data at these wavelengths.
        - We use the well established mid-IR to X-ray scaling relation for AGN (Lutz et al. 2004; Gandhi et al. 2009) to estimate the F12μm/F[2−10keV] ratio.


#### [Dark Matter Response to Galaxy Assembly History](https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.02269)
    * We study the properties of four Milky Way mass dark matter haloes from the Aquarius project during their assembly history
    * 暗物质质量profile的演化和星系assembly有关：We find that the dark matter profiles do not significantly change with time, hence they become stable, when the fraction of baryons accumulated in the central regions reaches 80 percent of its present mass within the virial radius.
    * The mass accretion history shows that the haloes that assembled earlier are those that contain a larger amount of baryonic mass aforetime, which in turn allows the dark matter halo profiles to reach a stable configuration earlier. 


#### [The Buzzard Flock: Dark Energy Survey Synthetic Sky Catalogs](https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.02401)

#### [High-redshift quasars and their host galaxies I: kinematical and dynamical properties and their tracers](https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.02464)
    - **Interesting**
    * We perform a very-high resolution cosmological zoom-in simulation of a z = 7 quasar including state-of-the-art non-equilibrium chemistry, MBH formation, growth and feedback
    * We measure both the stellar-based quantities used to establish the z = 0 correlations, as well as the gas-based quantities available in z >6 observations
    * In our analysis, we find that the high-redshift population sits on the same correlations as the local one, when using the same tracers used at z = 0. When using the gas- based tracers, however, we recover the results of observations that MBHs appear to be over-massive.


#### [The Impact of Environment on Late Time Evolution of the Stellar Mass - Halo Mass Relation](https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.02568)
    - **Relevant, Interesting**
    * Using galaxy clusters from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, we measure the SMHM-mgap relation and its evolution out to z = 0.3.
    * we report statistically significant negative evolution in the slope of the SMHM relation to z = 0.3 (> 3.5σ). The steepening of the slope over the last 3.5 Gyrs can be explained by late-time merger activity at the cores of galaxy clusters.
    * At small radii (20kpc), the slope of the SMHM relation is shallow, indicating that the core of the central galaxy is less related to the growth of the underlying host halo.


#### [Rapid Black Hole Growth at the Dawn of the Universe: A Super-Eddington Quasar at z=6.6](https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.02615)
    * z = 6.621 quasar PSO J006+39的NIR光谱; 黑洞质量 > 10^8 Msun
    * This NIR (rest-frame ultraviolet, UV) spectrum shows blue continuum slope and rich metal emission lines in addition to Lyα line.
    * Continuum slope和薄盘模型不一致：The power-law slope index (αλ) of the continuum emission is −2.94 ± 0.03, significantly bluer than the slope of αλ = −7/3 predicted from standard thin disc models.
    * SED拟合，考虑了吸积流产生的warm and hot Comptonisation: SED models require that the source is super-Eddington (Lbol/LEdd   9), so the apparently small disc may simply be the inner funnel of a puffed up flow, and clearly the SMBH in this quasar is in a rapid growth phase.
        - 大部分SDSS QSO蓝端连续谱slope在 -1.5左右，比SS73薄盘模型预测的要shallow
        - Slope和黑洞质量关系不大，消光肯定有影响；吸积盘的角度以及BH自旋有影响，倾角越小，自旋越高，连续谱越蓝；吸积率有一定的影响


#### [Asymmetric jet production in the Active Galactic Nucleus of NGC1052](https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.02639)
    * Few Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) reveal a double sided jet system. However, these are crucial to understand basic physical properties of extragalactic jets.
    * We monitored the sub-parsec scale morphology of NGC 1052 with the VLBA at 43 GHz from 2005 to 2009
    * show a remarkable asymmetry between both jets. A kinematic analysis of the outflows reveals higher apparent velocities for the eastern (approaching) jet as compared to the western (receding) one


#### [Deconstructing double-barred galaxies in 2D and 3D. I. Classical nature of the dominant bulges](https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.02684)
    * 二维多成分分解，结合统计上的三维去投影
    * we analyse the nature of the dominant bulges within double-barred systems by using several photometric diagnostics, namely S ́ersic index, Kormendy relation, colours, and the better suited intrinsic flattening.
    * almost all bulges in our sample are classical, whereas only 2 out of the 17 galaxies under study appear as potential candidates to host secularly-formed disc-like bulges
        - In this project we derive the 3D shape of bulges and (inner and outer) bars with the code galaXYZ (M ́endez-Abreu et al. 2010; Costantin et al. 2018).


#### [Non-parametric Star Formation History Reconstruction with Gaussian Processes I: Counting Major Episodes of Star Formation](https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.02877)
    - **Relevant， Interesting**
    * The method uses Gaussian Processes to create smooth SFHs that are independent of any functional form, with a flexible number of parameters that is adjusted to extract the maximum possible amount of SFH information from the SEDs being fit.
    * 拟合大批CANDELS星系：We quantify the fraction of galaxies that show multiple major episodes of star formation, finding that the median time between two peaks of star formation is ∼ 0.42+0.15t Gyr


#### [Are LGRBs biased tracers of star formation? Clues from the host galaxies of the Swift/BAT6 complete sample of bright LGRBs III: Stellar masses, star formation rates and metallicities at z>1](https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.02457)
    * Previous studies we carried out at z ă 1 supported the hypothesis that the conditions necessary for the progenitor star to produce an LGRB (e.g. low metallicity), were challenging the use of LGRBs as star-formation tracers, at least at low redshift.
    * 在 1 < z < 2: LGRBs do not directly trace star formation at 1 ă z ă 2, and they tend to avoid high- mass, high-metallicity host galaxies. 
    * we demonstrate that the driving factor ruling the LGRB efficiency is metallicity. The LGRB host distributions can be reconciled with the ones expected from galaxy surveys by imposing a metallicity upper limit of 12+log(O/H) ~ 8.55
    * 金属丰度决定了LGRB的产生效率；可能还是trace z>3的恒星形成，因为 Z< 0.7 Zsun
    * 金属丰度的作用可能和产生produce a fast-rotating Wolf-Rayet stars in close binary systems有关
