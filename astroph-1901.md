#### [Space Telescope and Optical Reverberation Mapping Project. X. The Hidden Life of "the Obscurer" in NGC 5548 and Understanding the Absorption-Line Holiday](https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.11578)
    * The Space Telescope and Optical Reverberation Mapping Project (AGN STORM) on NGC 5548 in 2014 is the most intensive multi-wavelength AGN monitoring campaign ever.
    * The lines varied independently of the observed UV-optical continuum during a 60 -- 70 day "holiday."
    * In our model, variations in this obscurer's line-of-sight covering factor modify the soft X-ray continuum. This leads to changes in the ionization of helium gas in the broad-line region.


#### [The SAMI Galaxy Survey: Exploring the gas-phase Mass-Metallicity Relation](https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.11263)
    * we do not find any significant secondary relation of the MZR with either the star formation rate (SFR) nor the specific SFR (SFR/Mass) for any of the calibrators used in this study
    * if there is a dependence with the SFR, it is weaker than the reported one, it is confined to the low mass regime (M*<10^9Msun) or high SFR regimes


#### [Galaxy assembly bias of central galaxies in the Illustris simulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.11210)
    * Galaxy stellar mass Mstar is found to have a tighter correlation with peak maximum halo circular velocity Vpeak than with halo mass Mh. Once the correlation with Vpeak is accounted for, Mstar has nearly no dependence on any other halo assembly variables.

#### [Near-Infrared Survey and Photometric Redshifts in the Extended GOODS-North field](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.00013)
    * WIRCam拍的GOODS-N的J和H图像; 更好的Photo-z，尤其是加了GALEX的UV数据后
    * we cross-matched our catalog with the updated 2M-CDFN X-ray catalog from Xue et al. (2016) and found that 658 out of 683 X-ray sources have counterparts.


#### [WALLABY Early Science - II. The NGC 7232 galaxy group](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.00241)
    * 36 beams to map a field of view of 30 square degrees.
    * we detect 17 HI sources. Eleven of these detections are identified as galaxies and have stellar counterparts, of which five are newly resolved HI galaxy sources. The other six detections appear to be tidal debris in the form of HI clouds that are associated with the central triplet, NGC 7232/3, comprising the spiral galaxies NGC 7232, NGC7232B and NGC7233
    * The remaining HI clouds are likely transient tidal knots that are possibly part of a diffuse tidal bridge between NGC 7232/3 and another group member, the lenticular galaxy IC 5181.

#### [Detecting Dark Matter Cores in Galaxy Clusters with Strong Lensing](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.00507)
    * modeling a cluster halo with ellipticity in the gravitational potential can bias the inferred mass and concentration, which may bias the inferred central density when weak lensing or X-ray data are added.
    * 如果真的density profile和假设不符合，也会引起spurious detection of core的可能
    * Central image 对定模型特别关键
    * Applying our methodology to Abell 611 and imposing a reasonable prior on the stellar mass-to-light ratio restricts the core size to be less than about 4 kpc

#### [Analysis of the spatially-resolved V-3.6um colors and dust extinction in 257 nearby NGC and IC galaxies](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.00565)
    * spatially-resolved maps for the observed V and g to 3.6um flux ratios and the inferred dust extinction values, A_V, for a sample of 257 nearby NGC and IC galaxies.  SDSS+Spitzer
    * By applying the "Beta_V method" (Tamura et al. 2009, 2010), which was recently calibrated as a function of redshift and morphological type by Kim et al. (2017), dust extinction maps for each galaxy were created. 
    * We highlight noticeably redder V-3.6um colors in the center of star-forming galaxies and galaxies with a weak AGN. 

#### [Dynamical Histories of the Crater II and Hercules Dwarf Galaxies](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.00594)
    * 考察这两个UFD之前被银河系strip的可能性; 通过成员星得到速度弥散度，质光比，和金属丰度
    * Crater II在动力学冷的DM halo中;
    * Given the available kinematic data, we find a probability of ∼ 40% that Hercules has suffered tidal stripping. The proper motion of Crater II makes it almost certain to be stripped.


#### [CO Multi-line Imaging of Nearby Galaxies (COMING). VII. Fourier decomposition of molecular gas velocity fields and bar pattern speed](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.00640)
    * On average, the investigated barred (SAB and SB) galaxies exhibit a ratio of noncircular to circular velocities of molecular gas larger by a factor of 1.5-2 than non-barred (SA) spiral galaxies at radii within the bar semimajor axis ab at 1 kpc
    * this trend is caused by kpc-scale streaming motions of molecular gas in the bar region.

#### [Bar properties and photometry of barred low surface brightness disc galaxies](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.00762)
    * We find that bars in LSBs are shorter and weaker when compared with those in HSBs galaxies.
    * We also find that bars in LSBs have comparable relative bar pattern speeds to those in HSBs, the majority of which we find to be ‘fast’ (i.e. R < 1.4).
    * n general, we find that our barred LSBs have comparable central surface brightnesses and total magnitudes to unbarred LSBs, albeit slightly brighter.

#### [The Data Analysis Pipeline for the SDSS-IV MaNGA IFU Galaxy Survey: Overview](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.00856)
    * For DR15, these measurements include stellar kinematics (velocity and velocity dispersion), emission-line properties (kinematics, fluxes, and equivalent widths), and spectral indices (e.g., D4000 and the Lick indices).
    * 关于匹配 spectral resolution 的 appendix很有用
