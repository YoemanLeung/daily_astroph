#### [Near-Infrared Survey and Photometric Redshifts in the Extended GOODS-North field](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.00013)
    * WIRCam拍的GOODS-N的J和H图像; 更好的Photo-z，尤其是加了GALEX的UV数据后
    * we cross-matched our catalog with the updated 2M-CDFN X-ray catalog from Xue et al. (2016) and found that 658 out of 683 X-ray sources have counterparts.


#### [WALLABY Early Science - II. The NGC 7232 galaxy group](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.00241)
    * 36 beams to map a field of view of 30 square degrees.
    * we detect 17 HI sources. Eleven of these detections are identified as galaxies and have stellar counterparts, of which five are newly resolved HI galaxy sources. The other six detections appear to be tidal debris in the form of HI clouds that are associated with the central triplet, NGC 7232/3, comprising the spiral galaxies NGC 7232, NGC7232B and NGC7233
    * The remaining HI clouds are likely transient tidal knots that are possibly part of a diffuse tidal bridge between NGC 7232/3 and another group member, the lenticular galaxy IC 5181.
