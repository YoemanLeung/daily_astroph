### 1310.1396 Simulation of ICL and diffuse light 
  + 

### 1310.2239 Mergers and mass accretion for infalling halos end outside viral radius

### 1310.2255 Halo-driven size and velocity dispersion evolution of ETGs 

### 1310.2253: Metal budget at z~0 from COS-Halo survey 
  + 
  
### 1310.2770: Sub-arcsec N- and Q-band imaging atlas of nearby AGN 
  + Summary of all ground-base AO observations at 12 and 18 microns 
  + From arcsec to sub-arcsec, the continuum emission is 20% lower; the PAH 
    emission almost disappears 

### 1310.2607: SLUGGS survey: wide-field kinematics of ETGs 
  + Slit-masks spectra using DEIMOS Skims 
  + Kinematic homogeneity inside Re breaks down at larger radii, especially for 
    fast-rotators
  + The outer trends could depend on morphological types.  
  
### 1310.3255: UV color of ETGs and its connection to IMF by Dennis Zaritsky 
  + The UV-color-M/L relation is very tight 
  + The author think the slope of low-mass end of IMF has something to do with 
    the EBHB stars 
  + There are interrelated correlation among, sigma_star, UV-color, [Mg/Fe], and 
    M*/L 

### 1310.4177: Dust attenuation from 3D-HST survey at z~1.5 
  + Av_HII and Av_Stars --> two-component dust models 
  + Have different trends with sSFR: for high-sSFR: Av_HII ~ Av_Stars; 
    For low sSRF: Av_HII > Av_Stars

### 1310.4179: Decompostion of M31 into bulge+disk+halo using SB, star counts 
               and kinematics 
  + Affine-invariant MCMC algorithm; LF was modelled with broken Power-law 
  + kinematic evidence for a 'Kick-up disk' population in halo

### 1310.4834: Globular Cluster Scale Sizes in M87 
  + According to simple tidal theory, r_h \propto {R_gc}^0.4-0.5 
  + Observations revealed much shallower relation for massive ellipticals 
  + Could be understood by the case that outer halo clusters originally formed 
    tidally under-filling --> They could be captured from smaller galaxies.

### 1310.4950: FMOS-COSMOS Survey on the Mass-[O/H] Relation at z~1.6
  + A flattening of the MZ relation for massive galaxies at late time 
  + Possible evolution for the fundamental metallicity relation
