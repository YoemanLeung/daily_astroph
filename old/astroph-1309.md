### 1308.6581: SWIFT/IFS survey of 27 ETGs in Coma 
 + At environment much denser than galaxies in Atlas3D, the fraction of slow 
   rotators is very consistent (15%)
 + In cluster, the slow rotators are found in regions of higher projected 
   density

### 1308.6585: SLUGGS survey of NGC4278 using ACS/HST and Suprime-Cam/Subaru 
 + "Blue-tilt" in the CMR of blue GCs population  
 +  Negative color gradient for both color population
 +  Size of GCs decreases with redder colodr; and increase with radius

### 1308.6764: SAM studies of HI and H2 gas using both pressure- and metallicity-
  based recipe
 + High-mass end of HI mass function remains constant after z<2.0
 + The two recipes are different at low-mass end

### 1309.0004: Disk profiles in Dwarf Galaxies 
 + Nice introduction

### 1309.0006: PNe in the halo of M87
 + The PN number density profile is consistent with M87 halo + ICL

### 1309.0013: Molecular outflows in BCG of A1835
### 1309.0014: Molecular flows in BGC of A1664 
 + Both are from ALMA early science CO(1-0) and CO(2-1) observations
 + BCGs in the cooling flow clusters are probably the most gas rich ETGs 
 + The first one: outflow is closely related to X-ray cavities and could be 
   lauched by AGN --> Radio mode feedback not only couple to hot gas, but also 
   cold molecular gas

### 1309.0047: Primordial Helium Abundance 
 + From Planck: Y\_p = 0.2485 \pm 0.0002
 + This work: updated He emissivities; using metal poor extragalactic HII 
   regions --> Y\_p = 0.2465 \pm 0.0097

### 1309.0790: SkyNet: Network training tool for machine learning 
   
### 1309.1136: Environment effect on Mass-Size distribution by Cappellari 
 + Compare the mass-size distribution of Atlas3D and Coma galaxies 
 + At extremely dense environment, spiral --> bulge dominated fast rotators with 
   very similar properties on mass-size relation, the author thinks it is an 
   evidence of environment effect 
 + At extremely dense region, the slow rotators are segregated in mass with 
   fast rotators. M\_crit = 2x10^11 M\_sun
   
### 1309.1444: Morphological parameters of S4G galaxies: 
 + Including: C, A, S, G, M20, E, G_M 
 + Discuss the correlation between these parameters, and propose methods in 
   selecting outliers like mergering systems
   
### 1309.1298: SF Galaxies in a Young Cluster at z~0.86 
 + The cluster is still being assembled; the intermediate environemt is prefereed 
   by SF galaxies

### 1309.1183: Similarity of stellar mass fraction in group and cluster 
 + M* fraction depends weakly on total mass and ICL component is significant in 
   cluster
 + Group has much smaller baryons than massive clusters

### 1309.1166: Normal abundance of satellites in Fossil Group 
 + Deep photometry of NGC 6482 group by Subaru 
 + Evidence of recent and ongoing merger events among bright group members
 + Find an edge-on S0 galaxies is in the phase of minor merging

### 1309.4570: Stellar ages at the corners of the boxy bulge of Milky way 
 + Mean reddening and distance can be estimated by using the location of the 
   red-clump stars on the CMR 
 + Metallicity can be obtained using the color distribution of the upper 
   red giant branch 

### 1309.4448: SATMC: MCMC code for SED fitting
 + Brief introduciton about Bayesian MCMC 
 + Allow upper limit for observations: (! SHOULD LEARN )
   - The method for incorporating upper limits is to assume a one-side 
     Gaussian function describing the possiblity of acceptance for a model that 
     falls below the observed limit 

### 1309.4459: Role of interaction in the SFR-M* relation 
 + Herschel + COSMOS + visual classification 
 + At 0.2 < z < 1.5, 18% of main sequence galaxies show evidence of interaction 
 + Fraction of interaction increase with infrared luminosity, and distance from 
   main sequence 

### 1309.4458: M*-Z relation at high-z, low-mass end 
 + WISP WFC3/IR Grism stacking + R23 method

### 1309.4104: Catalogs of HVC from GASS DR2
 + AVC: Anomalous veclocity clouds which do not meet the traditional veclocity 
   criteria of HVC but deviate significantly from Galactic rotations
 + Type of clouds in the Milky Way: HVC, AVC, compact-HVC, ultra-compact-HVC, 
   (Braun & Burton 1999; Bruns & Westmeier 2004; Giovanelli+2010), projection-
   affected low velocity halo clouds (Peek+2010), and cold/warm low veclocity 
   clouds (Saul+2012)

### 1309.4331: 
 + To understand the nature and the origin of the halo gas that are responsible 
   to the DLA in Quasar spectrum, IFU kinematics of the central galaxies can be 
   very helpful 
 + The gas can be from outflows, or in corotation with their halo

### 1309.4381: Topology of SDSS LRG 
 + Topology statistics can be used to test the Gaussianity of initial density 
   field (Gott+1986) --> topology measurements at the current epoch should 
   reflect that of the intial conditions on smoothing scale considerably larger 
   than the correlation length --> becauss fluctuations that are still in 
   liner regimes maitain their initial topology
 + Genus-related statistics for topology (Avelino 1997)

### 1309.4093: Scatter around the star-forming main sequence increases with 
               stellar mass 
 + COSMOS + UVJ selection; SFR from IR+UV; Stacking Spitzer observations for 
   24mu undetected objects
 + M* > 10^(10.95); 0.6<z<0.8 
 + !!! E-mail the authors: Stellar mass uncertainties; Why not including 
   "Quiescent" galaxies into account ? ; More than just gaussian fit ? Better 
   method to decide the intrinsic scatter ? (Uncertainties of the scatter from 
   the separation of SFG to QG using UVJ plane ? Skewness of the distribution 
   as an indicator of something related to quenching? 2-D modelling?
