    * 61 nucleated dwarf galaxies in the central regions (􏰘 Rvir/4) of the Fornax galaxy cluster.
    * In general, nuclei are consistent with colors of confirmed metal-poor globular clusters, but with significantly smaller dispersion than other confirmed compact stellar systems in Fornax.
    * We find a bimodal nucleus mass distribution with peaks located at log(M∗/M⊙)≃5.4 and ∼ 6.3. These two nucleus sub-populations have different stellar population properties, the more massive nuclei are older than ∼ 2 Gyr and have metal-poor stellar populations (Z ≤ 0.02 Z⊙), while the less massive nuclei are younger than ∼ 2 Gyr with metallicities in the range 0.02 < Z/Z⊙ ≤ 1.

#### [On the Transition of the Galaxy Quenching Mode at 0.5<z<1 in CANDELS](https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.00595)

    * 对比有AGN和no-AGN feedback的模拟
    * Our MrAGN model launches galactic outflows which result in both “ejective” feedback — the outflows themselves which drive gas out of galaxies — and “preventative” feedback, which suppresses the inflow of new and recycling gas.
    * The histories of NoAGN galaxies are recycling-dominated, with ∼ 70% of material that leaves the galaxy eventually returning, and the majority of outflowing gas re-accretes on 1 Gyr timescales without AGN feedback.

#### [Unbiased clustering estimates with the DESI fibre assignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.00951)
    * Clustering of samples constructed using a limited number of passes will be strongly affected by missing targets.
    * The effect of missing galaxies can be corrected when calculating the correlation function using a weighting scheme for pairs
    * On BAO scales, we find that the error is a factor 2 worse after one pass, but that after three or more passes, the errors are very similar.

    - **Interesting**
    * We find that the range of UV upturn strengths in the population as a whole has not declined over the past 2.2 Gyrs. This is consistent with a model where hot horizontal branch stars, produced by a Helium-enriched population, provide the required UV flux.
    * Helium abundances of at least 1.5 times the primor- dial value for this HB population
    * 作者认为来自贫金属星的可能可以排除，但是富金属只是对平均星族而言

    * We find that the interstellar medium seen in absorption is dominated by outflowing material
    * Mass loss rates in the low ionization phase are comparable to or in excess of the star formation rate, with total outflow rates likely higher when accounting for ionized gas.
    * Gas phase Si abundances are significantly super-solar relative to Fe and Ni ([Si/Fe]~0.4), indicating a combination of α-enhancement and dust depletion.


#### [50% of Quasar Outflows are Situated at Least 100 Parsecs From the Central Source](https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.01543)
    * Our results show that Siv absorption is only detected in 25% of Civ BAL outflows. The smaller detection fraction is due to the higher total column density (NH) needed to detect Siv absorption.
    * We find that at least 50% of quasar outflows are at distances larger than 100 pc from the central source, and at least 12% are at distances larger than 1000 pc.

    * S iv and S iv* troughs, whose ratio can be used to determine the distance of the outflows from the central source (R)
    * At least two of the outflows have a kinetic luminosity greater than 0.5% of their Eddington luminosity, implying that they are able to provide significant AGN feedback.
    * most of these outflows are situated far away from the AGN accretion disk; and that a significant portion of them can contribute to AGN feedback processes.


#### [A Mini-BAL Outflow at 900 pc from the Central Source: VLT/X-shooter Observations](https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.01545)

#### [The origin of the mid-infrared nuclear polarization of active galactic nuclei](https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.01899)
    * For all radio quiet objects, we found that the nuclear polarization is low (< 1 per cent).
    * Only the radio-loud Cygnus A exhibits significant nuclear polarization (∼11 per cent), attributable to synchrotron emission from the pc-scale jet close to the core. 
    * For highly obscured objects arises from a self-absorbed MIR polarized clumpy torus and/or dichroism from the host galaxy, while for unabsorbed cores, MIR polarization arises from dust scattering in the torus and/or surrounding nuclear dust.

        - 所以z~1的SF星系的z~2前身可能质量要小很多 
    * we show that the current SF activity of massive galaxies (> L∗ ) at z ∼ 1 correlates with SF levels at least 3 Gyrs prior: SFHs retain ‘memory’ on a large fraction of the Hubble time.

#### [Quantifying the AGN-driven outflows in ULIRGs (QUADROS) III: Measurements of the radii and kinetic powers of 8 near-nuclear outflows](https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.02647)

    - by Yanxia Xie & Luis Ho
    * Decompose the emission features of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) from mid-infrared spectra using theoretical PAH templates in conjunction with modified blackbody components for the dust continuum and an extinction term.
    * In addition to providing accurate measurements of the PAH emission, including upper limits thereof, our fits can reproduce reasonably well the overall continuum shape and constrain the line-of-sight extinction


#### [Three dynamically distinct stellar populations in the halo of M49](https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.03092)
    - **Relevant, Interesting**
    * We study the position-velocity-plane for bright and faint PN populations out to 95 kpc radius, and employ a multi-Gaussian model for the velocity distribution to identify stellar populations with distinct kinematics and histories.
    * We find two kinematically distinct PN populations associated with the main M49 halo and the extended intra-group light (IGL).
    * The blue colours of the IGL component are consistent with a population of stars formed in low-mass galaxies at redshift ∼ 0.5 that has since evolved passively, as suggested by other data.

    * we derive the mass-to-light ratio vs. colour relation (MLCR) both for quiescent and star-forming galaxies.
    * The rest-frame i−band mass-to-light ratio of quiescent and star-forming galaxies presents a tight correlation with the rest-frame (g − i) colour up to z = 1.5. Such MLCR is linear for quiescent galaxies and quadratic for star-forming galaxies.
    * The derived MLCRs do not present a significant redshift evolution and are compatible with previous local results in the literature. Finally, these tight relations also hold for g− and r−band luminosities.

#### [The formation and hierarchical assembly of globular cluster populations](https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.03652)
    - **Interesting**
    * Many previous works have argued that the observed linear relation between total GC mass and halo mass points to a fundamental GC – dark matter connection or indicates that GCs formed at very high redshift before feedback processes introduced nonlinearity in the baryon-to-dark matter mass relation
    * Constant mass ratio来自中心极限定理：by the central limit theorem, it is expected at z = 0 independent of the GC-to-halo mass relation at the time of GC formation.
    * It predicts that the cosmic GC formation rate peaked at z ∼ 4, too late for GCs to contribute significantly to the UV luminosity density during reionization.

    * The mass outflow rates are 12 − 400 M⊙ yr−1 and the inclination corrected average velocity of the outflowing gas 350 − 550 km s−1 (vmax = 500 − 900 km s−1 ). The origin of these outflows can be explained by the strong nuclear starbursts although the contribution of an obscured AGN can not be completely ruled out.
    * The outflow depletion times are 15 − 80 Myr.
    * The majority of the outflowing gas will return to the disk after 5 − 10 Myr and become available to form new stars.

#### [The Dearth of Difference between Central and Satellite Galaxies I. Perspectives on star formation quenching and AGN activities](https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.04004)

    * The gas component appears to have a significant role in producing the structure, so if there is little feedback, both the gas and stars organise into clear spiral arms, likely due to a lower combined Q

    * We show that while previous BoRG results favored a shallow power-law decline in the bright end of the luminosity function prior to reionization, there is now no evidence for departure from a Schechter function form and therefore no evidence for a difference in galaxy formation processes before and after reionization.


#### [A Likely Super Massive Black Hole Revealed by its Einstein Radius in Hubble Frontier Fields Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.05051)

    * An intrinsically compact region in one of the spiral arms is lensed into an arc that curves towards the BCG center. Crucially, this arc has a radius of curvature of only ∼0".6, betraying the presence of a local compact deflector.
    * The SMBH is noticeably offset by 4.4±0.3 kpc from the BCG light centre, plausibly the result of a kick imparted ∼ 2.9×107 years ago during the merger of two SMBHs, placing it just beyond the stellar core.

    * We find that, when limited to a certain stellar mass range and matched in color and concentration, all the samples present similar clustering amplitudes and neighbour counts on scales above ∼ 0.1h−1Mpc.
    * On smaller scales, in contrast, pseudo-bulge and pure-disk galaxies similarly show strong excess in close neighbour count when compared to control galaxies, at all masses probed.
    * These results imply strong connections between galactic bulges and galaxy-galaxy interactions in the local Universe, although it is unclear how they are physically linked in the current theory of galaxy formation.

    * An oscillating recoiled supermassive black hole (rSMBH) scenario is proposed to explain the observed velocity offset in broad emission lines.

    * We first show that the different redshift and mass distributions of radio–loud and –quiet NLS1s could be ascribed to observational biases.
    * Most of the different observational features of radio–loud and radio–quiet NLS1s are ascribed to the orientation of an intrinsically structured jet.

    * Eulerian code athena using high-resolution Godunov methods with low numerical diffusion.
    * We find that successful regulation of the cooling flow can be achieved with kinetic jets. Heating is anisotropic and is mostly distributed along the jet axis where the cooling flow is suppressed
    * Away from the jet axis the cooling flow is reduced by weak shock heating, but not fully suppressed
    * Turbulence is a significant source of heating only near the cluster centre, but this mechanism becomes inefficient at ∼ 50 kpc scales

    * The nuclear regions of IRAS 00183-7111 are likely stratified into different layers of matter: one inner and highly ionized by the strong radiation field of the AGN (as inferred from the high-ionization iron line found in the X-ray spectra), and one outer and colder, extending more than 5 kpc from the nucleus (as traced by the molecular gas observed with ALMA).


#### [The Fraction of Active Galactic Nuclei in the USS 1558-003 Protocluster at z = 2.53](https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.06569)
    * We have identified two X-ray AGN at the redshift of USS 1558−003, one of which is the radio galaxy.
    * USS 1558−003 does not have a significantly higher fraction of AGN than field galaxies at similar redshifts.
        - Those measurements have shown that while luminous AGN are substantially rarer in clusters than the field in the local universe, the AGN fraction is approximately the same in clusters and the field by 1 < z < 1.5, and there is some evidence that the AGN fraction is greater in dense environments at z > 2 (Martini et al. 2013; Alberts et al. 2016).


#### [The role of environment in the observed Fundamental Plane of radio Active Galactic Nuclei](https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.06600)

    * The lens redshifts of the sample have a mean value of 0.52, but the source redshifts span a wide range from 0.8 to 3.5, which leads to a wide range of Einstein radii up to three effective radii.
    * The total mass distribution is very close to isothermal one with the average logarithmic density slope gamma=2.0

#### [A scenario on the power-law total mass-density profile of the inner regions of early-type-galaxies](https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.06629)

    * We tested initial mass functions already used in a previous work, as well as two new models, based on low-mass tapered (”bimodal”) IMFs, where the IMF becomes either (1) bottom-heavy in more massive galaxies, or (2) is time-dependent, switching from top-heavy to bottom-heavy in the course of galactic evolution.
    * 和观测比，最好的模型是 either by models with a constant, Salpeter IMF, or by those with a time-dependent distribution.

    * The slopes of normalized attenuation laws depend primarily on the complexities of star-dust geometry. Increasing fractions of unobscured young stars flatten normalized curves, while increasing fractions of unobscured old stars steepen curves.
    * we find dramatic variation in the 2175A ̊ ultraviolet (UV) bump strength, including a subset of curves with little to no bump.

    * We find that a large fraction (81%) of these AGN have bi-conical NLR morphology.
    * Our inferred opening angle distribution implies a number ratio of type I to type II AGN of 1:1.6–2.3, consistent with other measurements of the type I / type II ratio at low AGN luminosities

    * Is best explained by dramatic changes in the innermost regions of the accretion disk.

    * Low-mass haloes in the most dense environments are more likely to host a central galaxy than those in the least dense environments
    * At a fixed low halo mass, early-formed haloes are more likely to host a central galaxy than late- formed haloes since they have had more time to assemble.
    * The satellite occupation shows a reverse trend where early-formed haloes host fewer satellites due to having more time to merge with the central galaxy.

    * The COS-LRG survey shows that massive quiescent halos contain widespread chemically- enriched cool gas and that little distinction between LRG and star-forming halos is found in their H I and C III content.


#### [Variable broad lines and outflow in the weak blazar PBC J2333.9-2343](https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.07364)

    * We find a decrease in the median star formation rate from low to high-density environments in all bins of stellar mass and a sharp rise of the quenched fraction (from ∼ 10% to ∼ 40 − 60%) of intermediate stellar mass galaxies
    * The quenched fraction for massive galaxies shows little dependence on environment being constant at ∼ 30 − 40%.

    * The most effective of the size-magnitude cuts considered recover the clustering signal around low-redshift primaries (z < 0.15) with about two-thirds of the signal and 80\%\ of the signal-to-noise ratio obtainable using the full COSMOS photometric redshifts. 


#### [A New Perspective on the Large-Scale Tidal Effect on the Galaxy Luminosity and Morphology](https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.07492)
    * Study the mean tidal coherence of galaxy environments as a function of intrinsic luminosity determined by the absolute r-band magnitude.
    * The tidal coherence of a galaxy environment is estimated as the cosine of the angle between two minor eigenvectors of the tidal field smoothed at the scales of 2 and 30 h−1Mpc centered on each of the local galaxies
    * It is found that the samples containing more luminous wall and field galaxies yield lower mean values of the tidal coherence
    * The early-type spiral field galaxies show no significant dependence on the tidal coherence, while both of the least and most luminous elliptical wall galaxies are found to dwell in the regions with highest tidal coherence.

    * The class ordering provided by the one-dimensional self-organizing maps corresponds to an ordering in physical prop- erties, a potentially important feature for the exploration of large datasets.

#### [Explaining changing-look AGN with state transition triggered by rapid mass accretion rate drop](https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.07873)
    * We suggest that all changing-look AGNs are similarly associated with the state transition at L/LEdd ∼ a few percent.


#### [A dynamical mechanism for the origin of nuclear rings](https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.07969)
    * Our theory is based on shear viscous forces among nested annuli of gas
    * The fact that gas follows non circular orbits in an external barred potential has profound consequences: instead of driving all the gas to the centre, viscosity creates a trapping region where it is energetically favourable to form a stable ring
    * We conclude that whether this mechanism for ring formation is relevant for real galaxies ultimately depends on the effective equation of state of the ISM.
