#### [The Sloan Digital Sky Survey Reverberation Mapping Project: Systematic Investigations of Short-Timescale CIV Broad Absorption Line Variability](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.00010)
    * investigate short-timescale (<10-day rest-frame) C iv broad absorption-line (BAL)
variability to constrain quasar-wind properties
    * These frequencies (50%) indicate that such variability is common among quasars and BALs
    * We also examine a variety of spectral characteristics and find that in some cases, BAL variability is best described by ionization-state changes, while other cases are more consistent with changes in covering fraction or column density.


#### [Roll of the Dice: A Stochastically Sampled IMF Alters the StellarContent of Simulated Dwarf Galaxies](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.00022)
    * We implement a self-consistent, stochastically populated IMF in cosmological hydrodynamic simulations
    * We find that a stochastic IMF in simulations makes feedback burstier, strengthening feed- back, and quenching star formation earlier in small dwarf galaxies.
    * For galaxies in halos with mass <10^8.5 M⊙, a stochastic IMF typically leads to lower stellar mass compared to a continuous IMF


#### [ZFOURGE: Extreme 5007Å emission may be a common early-lifetime phase for star-forming galaxies at z>2.5](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.00025)
    - **Interesting**
    * we analyze the properties of 19 Extreme Emission Line Galaxies (EELGs) identified in the bluest composite SED in the zfourge survey at 2.5 ≤ z ≤ 4.
    * Non-parametric SFH by prospector: The EELGs show evidence for a starburst in the most recent 50 Myr
    * We find that virtually all of our EELGs have rising SFHs, while most of our SFGs do not.
    * we hypothesize that many, if not most, star-forming galaxies at z ≥ 2.5 undergo an extreme Hβ+[Oiii] emission line phase early in their lifetimes.


#### [The Stellar Contents of Intermediate Mass Disk Galaxies in the Virgo Cluster. I. GMOS Spectra](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.00041)
    * Characteristic ages and metallicities are found by making comparisons with the strengths of lines measured from model spectra.
    * Rather, the central regions of four galaxies (NGC 4305, NGC 4306, NGC 4497, and NGC 4620) are dominated by populations with ages ∼ 1.5 − 3 Gyr.
    * The disks of these galaxies are dominated by populations that are at least 1 Gyr older than those near the centers, indicating that the quenching of star formation progressed from large radii inwards, and did not occur over a short timescale.


#### [Towards an informed quest for accretion disc winds in quasars: the intriguing case of Ton 28](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.00012)
    * Report on the detection of a blueshifted Fe K absorption feature in two consecutive XMM–Newton observations of the luminous blue quasar
    * The rest energy of 9.2 keV implies the presence of an accretion disc wind with bulk outflow velocity of ∼0.28c
    * Other peculiar optical/UV emissionline properties include narrow Hβ, strong Feii and blueshifted Civ. These are key parameters in the Eigenvector 1 formalism, and are frequently found in active galaxies with ongoing accretion disc winds

## Nov 4:

#### [A constant characteristic volume density of dark matter haloes from SPARC rotation curve fits](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.00553)
    * DM和disk星系盘的关系：We explore two cosmologically motivated DM halo profiles: the Einasto profile from DM-only simulations and the DC14 profile from hydrodynamic simulations.
    * We find that the characteristic volume density ρs of DM haloes is nearly constant over ∼5 decades in galaxy luminosity.
    * The scale radius rs and the characteristic surface density ρs · rs, instead, correlate with galaxy luminosity.


#### [The clustering of typical Lyα emitters from z∼2.5−6: host halo masses depend on Lyα and UV luminosities](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.00556)
    * We investigate the clustering and halo properties of ∼ 5000 Lyα-selected emission line galaxies (LAEs) from the Slicing COSMOS 4K (SC4K)
    * We measure clustering lengths of r0 ∼ 3 − 6 h−1 Mpc and typical halo masses of ∼ 10^11 M⊙ for our narrowband-selected LAEs
    * We find a strong, redshift-independent correlation between halo mass and Lyα luminosity normalized by the characteristic Lyα luminosity
    * Our results reveal that LAEs are the likely progenitors of a wide range of galaxies depending on their luminosity, from dwarf-like, to Milky Way-type, to bright cluster galaxies.


#### [GASP XIII. Star formation in gas outside galaxies](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.00823)
    * RPS气体：We demonstrate that the dominating ionization mechanism of this gas (between 64% and 94% of the Hα emission in the tails depending on the diagnostic diagram used) is photoion- ization by young massive stars due to ongoing star formation (SF) taking place in the stripped tails.
    * The tail clumps follow scaling relations (Mgas − M∗, LHα − σ, SFR-Mgas) similar to disk clumps, and their stellar masses are comparable to Ultra Compact Dwarfs and Globular Clusters.
    * The diffuse gas component in the tails is ionized by a combination of SF and composite/LINER-like emission likely due to thermal conduction or turbulence.


#### [ALMA observations of molecular tori around massive black holes](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.00984)
    * We report Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) observations of CO(3-2) emission in a sample of 7 Seyfert/LINER galaxies at the unprecedented spatial resolution


#### [Constraining the Mass Density of Free-Floating Black Holes using Razor-thin Lensing Arcs](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.00637)
    - **Interesting**
    * Strong lensing of AGNs in the radio can result in razor-thin arcs, with a thickness of less than a milli-arcsecond
    * Such razor-thin arcs provide a unique window on the coarseness of the matter distribution between source and observer
    * When sufficiently close to the line-of-sight, free-floating black holes cause kink-like distortions in the arcs, which are detectable by eye in the VLBI images as long as the black hole mass exceeds ∼ 1000 Solar masses.
    * we analytically compute constraints on the matter density of free-floating black holes resulting from null-detections of distortions along a realistic, fiducial arc, and find them to be comparable to those from quasar milli-lensing.

#### [Observational determination of the galaxy bias from cosmic variance with a random pointing survey: Clustering of z~2 galaxies from Hubble's BoRG survey](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.03265)
    * Gravitational clustering broadens the count-in-cells distribution of galaxies for surveys along uncorrelated (well-separated) lines of sight beyond Poisson noise.
    * measure this excess “cosmic” variance to constrain the galaxy bias --> 独立于2PCF的限制
    * we present an observational application of these methods using data from 141 uncorrelated fields, We detect a clear excess in the variance of the galaxy number counts distribution compared to Poisson expectations, from which we estimate a galaxy bias b ≈ 3.63 ± 0.57.
    * demonstrate that with N 􏰂 100 sight-lines, each containing N 􏰂 5 objects, the counts-in-cell analysis provides a robust measurement of the bias

    * We train two ensembles of neural networks on training sets consisting of simulated lenses, simulated non-lenses, and real sources.
    *  During visual inspection we rate 84 as "probably" or "definitely" lenses. Four of these are previously known lenses or lens candidates


#### [Inner bars also buckle. The MUSE TIMER view of the double-barred galaxy NGC 1291](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.03855)
    * We report on the discovery of the first Box-Peanut (B/P) structure in an inner bar detected in the face-on galaxy NGC 1291.
    * The B/P structure is detected as bi-symmetric minima of the h4 moment of the line-of-sight velocity distribution along the major axis of the inner bar, as expected from numerical simulations.
    * They also suggest that inner bars are long-lived structures, thus imposing tight constraints to their possible formation mechanisms.


#### [Initial Mass Function Variations Cannot Explain the Ionizing Spectrum of Low Metallicity Starbursts](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.03856)
    - **Interesting, Relevant**
    * We find that while the flux capable of ionizing hydrogen is only weakly dependent on IMF parameters, the photon flux responsible for the He II and O VI lines is far more sensitive to assumptions.
    * In our current models this flux arises primarily from helium and Wolf-Rayet stars which have partially or fully lost their hydrogen envelopes.
    * Even the most extreme IMFs cannot reproduce the He II ionizing flux observed in some high redshift galaxies, suggesting a source other than stellar photospheres.


#### [Powerful mechanical-driven outflows in the central parsecs of the Low-Luminosity Active Galactic Nucleus ESO428-G14](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.03985)
    * This work reports on the jet-driven mechanical energy and the corresponding mass outflow deposited by the jet in the central 170 parsecs of the nearby LLAGN ESO 428-G14.
    * The jet kinetic output is traced through the coronal line [Si vi] at 19641 Angstrom.
    * From the energetics of the ionized gas it is found that the mass outflow rate of the coronal gas is in the range from 3−8 Msun/yr


#### [CHANG-ES XII: A LOFAR and VLA view of the edge-on star-forming galay NGC 3556](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.04015)
    * We find that the spectral index in the galactic midplane is, as expected for young CRe, α ≈ −0.7 and steepens towards the halo of the galaxy as a consequence of spectral ageing.
    * While pure diffusion cannot explain our data, advection can, particularly if we assume a linearly accelerating wind.


#### [Detecting Radio-AGN signatures in Red geysers](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.04072)
    * We compare the nuclear radio activity of the red geysers to a matched control sample with similar stellar mass, redshift, rest frame NUV − r color, axis ratio and presence of ionized gas.
    * In addition to a 3 times higher FIRST detection rate, we find that red geysers have a 5σ higher level of average radio flux than control galaxies.
    * Red geysers and a possibly-related class with disturbed Hα emission account for 40% of all radio-detected red galaxies with log (M⋆/M⊙) < 11.
    * Our results support a picture in which episodic AGN activity drives large-scale-relatively weak ionized winds that may provide a feedback mechanism for many early-type galaxies.

    * Kinematics derived from near-IR and optical data from the SINFONI and MUSE IFUs on the VLT reveal AGN-driven outflows powered by a super-massive black hole
    * The symmetric bicone outflows show rapid acceleration to ±250 km s−1
    * Over the AGN active lifetime of ∼10^7 years, 1.6 × 108 M⊙ of gas can become gravitationally unbound from the galaxy, a large proportion of the gas mass available for star formation in the nuclear region.


#### [Constraining the three-dimensional orbits of galaxies under ram pressure stripping with convolutional neural networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.04553)
    - **Interesting**
    * For a given density of intracluster medium (ICM) and a given velocity of a disk galaxy, RPS can be controlled by two angles (θ and φ) that define the angular relationship between the direction vector of the galaxy’s three-dimensional (3D) motion within its host cluster and the galaxy’s spin vector
    * We first train a CNN by using ∼ 105 synthesized images of gaseous distributions of the galaxies from numerous RPS models with different θ and φ.
    * This result suggests that if the ICM is in hydrostatic equilibrium (thus not moving), the 3D orbit of a disk galaxy within its host cluster can be constrained by the spatial distribution of the gas being stripped by RPS.

## Nov 11:

#### [Weak lensing analysis of galaxy pairs using CS82 data](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.04940)
    - **Relevant**
    * We determine halo masses for the Total sample of pairs as well as for Interacting, Red and Higher luminosity pair subsamples with ∼ 3σ confidence
    * Derived lensing masses were compared to a proxy of the dynamical mass, obtaining a good correlation. However, there is a large discrepancy between lensing masses and the dynamical mass estimates, which could be accounted by astrophysical processes such as dynamical friction, by the inclusion of unbound pairs, and by significant deviations of the density distribution from a SIS and NFW profiles in the inner regions.


#### [Satellite galaxies in the Illustris-1 simulation: anisotropic locations around relatively isolated hosts](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.04942)
    - **Relevant**
    * As expected from previous studies, the satellites are distributed anisotropically in the plane of the sky, with a preference for being located near the major axes of their hosts.
    * When measured with respect to the hosts’ dark matter surface mass density, the mean satellite location depends strongly on host stellar mass and luminosity, with the satellites of the faintest, least massive hosts showing the greatest anisotropy.
    * The satellite locations are, however, dependent upon the stellar masses of the satellites, with the most massive satellites having the most anisotropic distributions.


#### [HST emission-line images of nearby 3CR radio galaxies: two photoionization, accretion and feedback modes](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.04946)
    * Based on nuclear emission line ratios, we divide the sample into High and Low Excitation Galaxies (HEGs and LEGs). We observe different line morphologies, extended line emission on kpc scale, large [O III]/Hα scatter across the galaxies, and a radio-line alignment.
    * We find evidence of correlations between line luminosities and (radio and X-ray) nuclear luminosities. All these results point to a main common origin, the active nucleus, which ionize the surrounding gas.
    * For LEGs (hot-gas accretors), the synchrotron emission from the jet represents the main source of ionizing photons. The lack of cold gas and star formation in their hosts accounts for the moderate ionized-gas masses and sizes.
    * For HEGs (cold-gas accretors), an ionizing continuum from a standard disk and shocks from the powerful jets are the main sources of photoionization, with the contribution from star formation.


#### [Detection of a Star Forming Galaxy in the Center of a Low-Mass Galaxy Cluster](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.04958)
    - **Interesting, Relevant**
    * In this work, we utilize XMM-Newton X-ray observations of five galaxy clusters to map the morphology of the intracluster medium (ICM), characterize the galaxy clusters, determine the position of the cluster center, and measure the offset between the cluster center and the superluminous disk galaxies.
    * We demonstrate that one superluminous lenticular galaxy, 2MASX J10405643-0103584, resides at the center of a low-mass (M500 = 1014 M⊙) galaxy cluster. This represents the first conclusive evidence that a superluminous disk galaxy is the central BCG of a galaxy cluster.


#### [Ambient Column Densities of Highly Ionized Oxygen in Precipitation-Limited Circumgalactic Media](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.04976)
    * This paper presents predictions for CGM absorption lines (O VI, O VII, O VIII, Ne VIII, N V) that are based on precipitation-regulated feedback models, which posit that the radiative cooling time of the ambient medium cannot drop much below 10 times the freefall time without triggering a strong feedback event.
    * Within the precipitation framework, the strongest O VI absorption lines result from vertical mixing of the CGM that raises low-entropy ambient gas to greater altitudes, because adiabatic cooling of the uplifted gas then lowers its temperature and raises the fractional abundance of O5+


#### [Dark matter stripping in galaxy clusters: a look at the Stellar to Halo Mass relation in the Illustris simulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.04996)
    * We find that subhaloes start losing their dark matter as soon as they reach ∼ 1.5 × Rvir from the centre of their host, and that up to 80% of their dark matter content get stripped during infall.


#### [Direct Detection of Quasar Feedback Via the Sunyaev-Zeldovich Effect](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.05023)
    - **Interesting**
    * The nature and energetics of feedback from thermal winds in quasars can be constrained via observations of the Sunyaev-Zeldovich Effect (SZE) induced by the bubble of thermal plasma blown into the intergalactic medium by the quasar wind.
    * we have made the first detection of such a bubble, associated with the hyperluminous quasar HE 0515-4414
    * Our detection appears on only one side of the quasar, consistent with the SZE signal arising from a combination of thermal and kinetic contributions.


#### [Figuring Out Gas & Galaxies in Enzo (FOGGIE). II. Emission from the z = 3 Circumgalactic Medium](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.05060)
    * We present mock emission- line maps of highly resolved CGM gas from the FOGGIE project
    * By increasing the spatial resolution alone, the total luminosity of the line emission increases by an order of magnitude. This increase arises in the abundance of dense small-scale structure resolved when the CGM gas is simulated to <100 pc scales
    * We conclude that accounting for small-scale structure well below the level of instrument spatial resolution is necessary to properly interpret such observations in terms of the underlying gas structure driving observable emission.


#### [Hierarchical Bayesian approach for estimating physical properties in nearby galaxies: Age Maps (Paper II)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.05273)
    - **Interesting**
    * We present a hierarchical Bayesian model to compute age maps from images in the Hα line (taken with Taurus Tunable Filter, TTF), ultraviolet band (GALEX far UV, FUV), and infrared bands
    * The Hα to FUV flux ratio is a good relative indicator of the very recent star formation history (SFH).
    * We propose a Bayesian hierarchical model where a joint probability distribution is de- fined to determine the parameters (age, metallicity, IMF) from the observed data (the observed flux ratios Hα/FUV).

#### [Dust in and around galaxies: dust in cluster environments and its impact on gas cooling](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.05477)
    - **Interesting** 可以看成是cluster环境下尘埃形成和摧毁的综述
    * Here we present cosmological hydrodynamical simulations of a cluster of galaxies, M200,crit = 6 × 10^14 M⊙, including a novel dust model for the moving mesh code AREPO.
    * Dust production, growth, supernova-shock-driven destruction, ion-collision-driven thermal sputtering, and high temperature dust cooling through far infrared re-radiation of collisionally deposited electron energies.
    * This results in noticeable changes of the entropy, temperature, and density profiles of cluster gas once dust formation is included.
    * We conclude that dust can survive sufficiently long in the intracluster medium to reach a small but significant abundance with implications for the thermodynamic properties of the cluster.


#### [The LoTSS view of radio AGN in the local Universe. The most massive galaxies are always switched on](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.05528)

    * a study of the local radio source population, by cross-comparing the data from the first data release (DR1) of the LOFAR Two-Metre Sky Survey (LoTSS) with the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) DR7 main galaxy spectroscopic sample
    * An improved method to separate active galactic nuclei (AGN) accurately from sources with radio emission powered by star formation (SF) is developed and applied, leading to a sample of 2121 local (z < 0.3) radio AGN.
    * The prevalence of radio AGN activity is confirmed to show a strong dependence on both stellar and black hole masses, remarkably reaching a fraction of 100 per cent of the most massive galaxies (> 10^11M⊙) displaying radio-AGN activity
    * More than 50 per cent of the energy is released during the ≤ 2 per cent of the time spent at the highest accretion rates

    * A systematic search of X-ray cavities, density jumps and shocks in the inter-galactic environment of the galaxy group IC 1262
    * X-ray imaging analysis reveals a pair of X-ray cavities on the north and south of the X-ray peak
    * The X-ray cavity at the position of southern radio lobe probably represents a first generation X-ray cavity. Two surface brightness edges are evident to the west and east−north of the center of this group.


#### [Correlation between SFR surface density and thermal pressure of ionized gas in local analogs of high-redshift galaxies](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.05663)
    - **姜天星**
    * We explore the relation between the star formation rate surface density (ΣSFR) and the interstellar gas pressure for nearby compact starburst galaxies
    * The high gas pressure and the correlation, are in agreement with those found in star-forming galaxies at z ∼ 2.5.
    * These extreme pressures are shown to be responsible for driving galactic winds in nearby starbursts. These outflows may be a crucial in enabling Lyman-α and Lyman-continuum to escape.

    * We report a new empirical calibration of R23 for extreme emission-line galaxies using a large sample of about 800 star-forming green pea galaxies with reliable Te-based gas-phase metallicity measurements.
    * For galaxies with strong emission lines and large ionization parameter (which manifests as log [OIII]λλ4959,5007/[OII]λλ3726,3729 ≥ 0.6), R23 monotonically increases with log(O/H) and the double-value degeneracy is broken.
    * We also report on 15 galaxies with metallicities less than 1/12 solar, with the lowest metallicities being 12+log(O/H) = 7.25 and 7.26.


#### [Interstellar Medium and Star Formation of Starburst Galaxies on the Merger Sequence](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.05822)

    * We present a detailed study of the infrared (∼ 1 − 500 μm) spectral energy distributions of a large sample of 193 nearby (z<0.088) luminous infrared galaxies (LIRGs)
    * The radiation field of LIRGs tends to have much higher intensity than in quiescent galaxies, and it increases toward advanced merger stages as a result of central concentration of the interstellar medium and star formation.
    * We find that the gas fraction of LIRGs is on average ∼0.3 dex higher than that of main-sequence star-forming galaxies, rising moderately toward advanced merger stages.

#### [The X-ray Variability of AGN and its Implications for Observations of Galaxy Clusters](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.05786)
    * 用X-ray找星系团会受到点源影响，大多数都是AGN：This can be addressed by combining observations from a high angular resolution observatory (such as Chandra) with deeper data from a more sensitive observatory that may not be able to resolve the AGN (like XMM-Newton). However, this approach is undermined if the AGN varies in flux between the epochs of the observations
    * We find a fractional variability that increases with increasing interval between observations, from about 0.25 for observations separated by tens of days up to about 0.45 for observations separated by ∼ 10 years.
    * given the precise X-ray flux of a typical AGN at one epoch, its flux at a second epoch some years earlier or later can be predicted with a precision of about 60% due to its variability

#### [Inferring a difference in the star-forming properties of lower versus higher X-ray luminosity AGNs](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.05980)
    * when the SFR/SFR_MS distribution of AGN hosts is modelled as a log-normal distribution (i.e. the same shape as that of MS galaxies), galaxies hosting more powerful X-ray AGNs (i.e. LX > 2 × 10^43erg s−1) display a narrower RMS distribution that is shifted to higher values compared to their lower LX counterparts.
    * Our results suggest that the typical star-forming properties of AGN hosts change with LX, and that more powerful AGNs typically reside in more MS-like star-forming galaxies compared to lower LX AGNs.

    - **Interesting, PrettyFigure**
    * First galaxy–OVI absorption kinematic study for 20 absorption systems (EW>0.1 Å) associated with isolated galaxies (0.15 ≤ z ≤ 0.55) that have accurate redshifts and rotation curves obtained using Keck/ESI.
    * 把absorber按照major axis和minor axis划分：OVI absorption along the galaxy major axis is not correlated with galaxy rotation kinematics, with only 1/10 systems that could be explained with rotation/accretion models. 和MgII符合co-rotation很不一样
    * OVI along the minor axis could be modeled by accelerating outflows but only for small opening angles, while the majority of the OVI is decelerating
    * We conclude that OVI alone does not serve as a useful kinematic indicator of gas accretion, outflows or star-formation and likely best probes the halo virial temperature.

#### [A high space density of L* Active Galactic Nuclei at z~4 in the COSMOS field](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.06404)
    * We ended up with 16 spectroscopically confirmed AGNs at 3.6 < z < 4.2 down to a magnitude of iAB=23.0 for an area of 1.73 deg2. This leads to an AGN space density of ∼ 1.6 × 10−6Mpc−3 (corrected) at z ∼4 for an absolute magnitude of M1450 = −23.5. This is higher than previous measurements and seems to indicate that AGNs could make a substantial contribution to the ionizing background at z ∼ 4.


#### [SDSS-IV MaNGA: Signatures of halo assembly in kinematically misaligned galaxies](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.06408)

    * We select a sub-sample of ∼900 central galaxies from the MaNGA survey with defined global position angles (PA; angle at which velocity change is greatest) for their stellar and Hα gas components up to a minimum of 1.5 effective radii (Re).
    * We find, at fixed halo mass, no statistical difference in these properties between our kinematically aligned and misaligned galaxies. We suggest that the lack of correlation could be indicative of cooling flows from the hot halo playing a far larger role than ‘cold mode’ accretion from the cosmic web

    - **Relevant**
    * 模拟研究group尺度的上的预处理过程：We categorize galaxies that were always in distinct haloes as unaccreted, galaxies that were distinct before accretion onto the main group as single, and galaxies that were in external sub-groups before accretion onto the main group as grouped.
    * Both single- and group-accreted galaxies begin to lose dark matter and gas after first accretion onto any host but continue to grow in stellar mass.
    * Single galaxies continue to form stars until the group virial radius is crossed, when they begin to lose both dark matter and gas. Grouped galaxies peak in mass when joining their external sub-group, indicating that they experience preprocessing
    * These differing histories place unaccreted, single and grouped galaxies in distinct regions of the stellar mass-to-halo mass (SMHM) relation.


#### [The Non-Uniformity of Galaxy Cluster Metallicity Profiles](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.05987)
    - **Interesting**
    * On average, we find a mild dependence of the core metallicity with the average temperature
    * We identify the cause of this mild dependence to be due to relaxed systems only; disturbed systems do not show this trend
    * The radial profiles of relaxed systems are centrally peaked and show a steep decrease with radius, flattening beyond 0.3-0.4R500. The metallicity of disturbed systems is also higher in the center but at much lower values than what is observed for relaxed objects.
    * The scatter of the radial profiles is quite large, but while for relaxed systems it decreases almost monotonically as function of the radius, for disturbed systems it shows a significant boost at large radii.
    * Systems with a central radio source have a flatter profile indicat- ing that central AGNs are an efficient mechanism to uplift and redistribute the metals in the ICM.


#### [Measurement of the Splashback Feature around SZ-selected Galaxy Clusters with DES, SPT and ACT](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.06081)
    - **Relevant, Important**
    * We present a detection of the splashback feature around galaxy clusters selected using the Sunyaev-Zel’dovich (SZ) signal.
    * The SZ observable used to select clusters in this analysis is expected to have a tighter correlation with halo mass and to be more immune to projection effects and aperture-induced biases, potentially ameliorating causes of systematic error for optically selected clusters.
    * We find that the measured rsp for SZ-selected clusters is consistent with the expectations from simulations, although the small number of SZ-selected clusters makes a precise comparison difficult.
    * when using optically selected redMaPPer clusters with similar mass and redshift distributions, rsp is ∼2σ smaller than in the simulations.
    * blue galaxies have profiles close to a power law with no discernible splashback feature, which is consistent with them being on their first infall into the cluster.

    * We estimate the systematic uncertainty in the galaxy-galaxy lensing measurements to be ∼ 6% (dominated by photometric redshift uncertainties) and in the galaxy-CMB lensing measurements to be ∼ 3%, from small scale modeling uncer- tainties including baryonic physics.


#### [Probabilistic Random Forest: A machine learning algorithm for noisy datasets](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.05994)
    - **Useful**
    * However, since most ML algorithms are not designed to take data uncertainties into account, ML based studies are mostly restricted to data with high signal-to-noise ratio.
    * In this work we modify the long-established Random Forest (RF) algorithm to take into account uncertainties in the measurements (i.e., features) as well as in the assigned classes (i.e., labels)
    * To do so, the Probabilistic Random Forest (PRF) algorithm treats the features and labels as probability distribution functions, rather than deterministic quantities.
    * Apart from improving the prediction accuracy in noisy datasets, the PRF naturally copes with missing values in the data, and outperforms RF when applied to a dataset with different noise characteristics in the training and test sets, suggesting that it can be used for Transfer Learning.


#### [Morpho-Photometric Redshifts](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.06374)

    * Galaxy-integrated quantities are fed to a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) branch while images are fed to a convolutional (convnet) branch that can learn relevant morpholog- ical features.
    * This split MLP-convnet architecture, which aims to disentangle strong photometric features from comparatively weak morphological ones, proves important for strong performance

    * Several correlations between γ′ and galactic properties including stellar mass, effective radius, stellar surface density, central velocity dispersion, central dark matter fraction and in-situ-formed stellar mass ratio are compared to observations and other simulations, revealing that IllustrisTNG reproduce correlation trends qualitatively,
    * The power-law density profile of the ETG dark matter halos is steeper in the full physics (FP) run than their counterparts in the dark matter only (DMO) run.
    * The dark matter inner slope is also anti-correlated with the halo concentration parameter c200 in both runs.

    * We find a tighter correlation of αCO with the gas depletion time than with star formation rate, yet with deviations induced by the transitions to and from the starburst episodes.


#### [HST/WFC3 grism observations of z ∼ 1 clusters: The cluster vs. field stellar mass-size relation and evidence for size growth of quiescent galaxies from minor mergers](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.06548)
    - **Relevant, Interesting**
    * The stellar mass-size relation in ten clusters and in the field is measured and compared at z ∼ 1
    * On average, quiescent and star-forming cluster galaxies are smaller than their field counterparts by (0.08 ± 0.04) dex and (0.07 ± 0.01) dex respectively.
    * These size offsets are consistent with the average sizes of quiescent and star-forming field galaxies between 1.2 <z <1.5, implying the cluster environment has inhibited size growth between this period and z ∼ 1.
    * Using a toy model, we show this is possible if ∼40% of the most compact clus- ter galaxies merge with their brightest cluster galaxies (BCGs) and ∼60% are tidally destroyed into the intra-cluster light (ICL) between 0 < z <1

    * The legacy value of MUSE-Wide lies in providing “spectroscopy of everything” without photometric pre-selection.
    * Using a 3D matched filtering approach we detected 1,602 emission line sources, including 479 Lyman-α (Lyα) emitting galaxies with redshifts 2.9 <z <6.3.
    * We encounter a higher outlier rate and a systematic offset of ∆z≃0.2 when comparing our MUSE redshifts with photometric redshifts from the literature.
    * Stacking X-ray images centered on our Lyα emitters yielded no signal; the Lyα population is not dominated by even low luminosity AGN.


#### [Dark matter-baryon scaling relations from Einasto halo fits to SPARC galaxy rotation curves](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.06554)

    * We report that the density at the radius where the slope is −2 is strongly anticorrelated to this radius, and to the Einasto index.
    * We report a positive correlation between the core size of halos with small Einasto index and the stellar disk scale-length, as well as between the averaged dark matter density within 2 kpc and the baryon-induced rotational velocity at that radius.


#### [Global Correlations Between the Radio Continuum, Infrared and CO Emission in Dwarf Galaxies](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.06554)
    * The results demonstrate that the properties of dwarf galaxies are not simple extensions of those of more massive galaxies
    * It is found that dwarfs show increasingly weaker CO and infrared emission for their luminosity, as expected for galaxies with a low dust content, slower reaction rates, and a hard ionizing radiation field.
    * 对高光度的dwarf: the total and non-thermal radio continuum emission appear to adequately trace the star formation rate
    * 对低光度dwarf: the infrared emission ceases to adequately trace the star formation rate.
    * A lack of a correlation between the magnetic field strength and the star formation rate in low star formation rate dwarfs suggests a breakdown of the equipartition assumption.

    * We combine radial velocity measurements from five literature sources taken over the course of ∼ 30 years to yield the largest multi-epoch kinematic sample for stars in the dSphs Draco and Ursa Minor.
    * Assuming Duquennoy & Mayor (1991) period and mass ratio distributions, the binary fractions in Draco and Ursa Minor are 0.50 and 0.78.
    * We find that a normal mass ratio distribution is preferred over a flat distribution
    * This indicates that the binary populations in Milky Way dSphs are not identical in regard to their binary fractions, period distributions, or both

    * We suggest that the rings in NGC 6534 and MCG 11-22-015 have different natures: the former is a resonant one supplied with gas perhaps through tidal effects, and the latter has been produced by a satellite accretion. Recent outer gas accretion is implied in both cases.


#### [A Deeply Buried Narrow-Line Seyfert 1 Nucleus Uncovered in Scattered Light](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.06674)

    * However, its NELs are unprecedentedly strong when compared to type 1 AGNs. This, together with its large MIR excess (g − W4 = 13.172 mag), implies that the observer and the narrow emission line region (NELR) might see a different ionization continuum.
    * Our optical spectropolarimetry confirms its type 2 nature by detectingapolarizedbluecontinuumandBalmerBELs
    * Discovery of J1203+1624 suggests that NLS1 follows AGN unfication scheme, studying of its analogs could blaze a new trail for exploring the connection between black hole growth and star formation in the host galaxy.


#### [The Formation of Compact Elliptical Galaxies in The Vicinity of A Massive Galaxy: The Role of Ram-pressure Confinement](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.06778)
    - **Relevant, Interesting**
    * As the infalling low-mass galaxy passes through the host’s corona at supersonic speeds, its diffuse gas outskirts are stripped by ram pressure, as expected. However, the compactness increases rapidly because of bursty star formation in the gas tidally driven to the centre.
    * After the gas is depleted, tidal interactions enhance the metallicity further via the stripping of weakly-bound, old and metal-poor stars, while the size of the satellite is changed only modestly.
    * These results argue that classical cEs are neither the stripped remnants of much more massive galaxies nor the merger remnants of normal dwarfs. We present observable predictions that can be used to test our model.

    * Arp 187 is one of the fading active galactic nuclei (AGN), whose AGN activity is currently decreasing in luminosity.
    * The VLA 5 GHz, 8 GHz, and the ALMA 133 GHz images reveal bimodal jet lobes with ∼5 kpc size and the absence of the central radio-core.
    * These multi-wavelength signatures indicate that Arp 187 hosts a “dying” AGN: the central engine is already dead, but the large scale AGN indicators are still observable as the remnant of the past AGN activity.


#### [Spatially Resolved [CII] Emission in SPT0346-52: A Hyper-Starburst Galaxy Merger at z~5.7](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.07800)
    * In this paper, we present ∼ 0.15 ALMA observations of the [CII]158μm emission line in this z = 5.7 dusty star-forming galaxy.
    * The lensing reconstruction reveals two spatially and kinematically separated components (∼ 1 kpc and ∼ 500 km s−1 apart) connected by a bridge of gas.
    * Both components are found to be globally unstable, with Toomre Q instability parameters ≪ 1 everywhere. We argue that SPT0346-52 is undergoing a major merger, which is likely driving the intense and compact star formation.

    * The polarization morphology suggests that the emission is associated with an underlying limb- brightened jet.
    * Our Faraday depolarization modeling suggests that the RM most likely originates from an external screen with a highly uniform RM distribution.

    * We find good average agreement between observed velocity dispersions, with ⟨log(σ′g,int/σ′⋆,int)⟩=−0.003.

     * A near-infrared (NIR) spectrum of WISE J1042+1641, an extremely red dust-obscured galaxy (DOG), which has been observed with the LIRIS on the 4.2m William Hershel Telescope
     * Based on the LIRIS observation, we confirmed its redshift of 2.521 and total IR luminosity of log(L_IR/L_sun) = 14.57, which satisfies the criterion for an extremely luminous IR galaxy (ELIRG).
     * We indicate that this object seems to have an extremely massive black hole with M_BH = 10^10.92 M_sun based on the broad Halpha line
     * We find that the M_BH/M_star ratio (i.e., 0.0140-0.0204) is significantly higher than the local relation, following a sequence of unobscured quasars instead of obscured objects

    * To robustly classify the ionizing radiation of such metal-poor galaxies, which dominate in the early Universe, we confirm 3 previous, and propose 11 novel diagnostic diagrams based on equivalent widths and luminosity ratios of UV emission lines, such as EW(OIII]λ1663) versus OIII]λ1663/HeIIλ1640, CIII]λ1908/HeIIλ1640 versus OIII]λ1663/HeIIλ1640, and CIVλ1550/CIII]λ1908 versus CIII]λ1908/CIIλ2326


#### [The MAGNUM survey: different gas properties in the outflowing and disk components in nearby active galaxies with MUSE](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.07935)
    * We study the gas properties in the disk and in the outflow with spatially and kinematically resolved maps, by dividing the strongest emission lines in velocity bins.
    * We find that the outflowing gas is characterised by higher values of density and ionisation parameter than the disk, which presents a higher dust extinction.


#### [The ATESP 5 GHz radio survey IV. 19, 38, and 94 GHz observations and radio spectral energy distributions](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.07938)
    * It is now established that the faint radio population is a mixture of star-forming galaxies and faint active galactic nuclei (AGNs), with the former dominating below S(1.4GHz) \sim 100 muJy and the latter at larger flux densities
    * One of the major open questions regarding faint radio AGNs is the physical process responsible for their radio emission.
    * AGN component associated with red/early-type galaxies. Such AGNs show, on average, flatter radio spectra than radio galaxies and are mostly compact (<= 30 kpc in size).


#### [Do Spectroscopic Dense Gas Fractions Track Molecular Cloud Surface Densities?](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.07940)
    * We use ALMA and IRAM 30-m telescope data to investigate the relationship between the spectroscopically-traced dense gas fraction and the cloud-scale (120 pc) molecular gas surface density in five nearby, star-forming galaxies
    * On average, the dense gas fraction correlates with the mass-weighted average molecular gas surface density. Thus, parts of a galaxy with higher mean cloud-scale gas surface density also appear to have a larger fraction of dense gas
    * The normalization and slope of the correlation do vary from galaxy to galaxy and with the size of the regions studied.


#### [The spectacular cluster chain Abell 781 as observed with LOFAR, GMRT, and XMM-Newton](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.07930)
    - **Interesting**
    * The Abell 781 complex is a spectacular system composed of an apparent chain of clusters on the sky. Its main component is undergoing a merger and hosts peripheral emission that is classified as a candidate radio relic and a disputed radio halo
    * We used new LOw Frequency ARay (LOFAR) observations at 143 MHz and archival Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (GMRT) observations at 325 and 610 MHz to study radio emission from non-thermal components in the ICM of Abell 781.
    * We speculate that it is related to the interaction between a head tail radio galaxy and shock. However, the current data allow us only to set an upper limit of <1.4 on the Mach number of this putative shock.


#### [Cosmological Inference from Galaxy-Clustering Power Spectrum: Gaussianization and Covariance Decomposition](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.08155)
    * Likelihood fitting to 2-point clustering statistics made from galaxy surveys usually assumes a multivariate normal distribution for the measurements, with justification based on the central limit theorem given the large number of over-density modes. However, this assumption cannot hold on the largest scales where the number of modes is low
    * We derive a procedure suitable for analysing measured monopole power spectra with window effects, stochastic shot noise and the dependence of the covariance matrix on the model being fitted all taken into account
    * We find in numerical tests that our new procedure gives more accurate constraints on the local non-Gaussianity parameter fNL, which is sensitive to the large-scale power.


#### [A LOFAR study of non-merging massive galaxy clusters](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.08410)
    * We distinguish between giant radio haloes, which occur predominantly in merging clusters, and mini haloes, which are found in non-merging, cool-core clusters.
    * With this aim, we carried out a campaign of observations with the LOw Frequency ARay (LOFAR) in the frequency range 120 - 168 MHz of nine massive clusters selected from the Planck SZ catalogue, which had no sign of major mergers.
    * We discover large-scale steep-spectrum emission around mini haloes in the cool-core clusters PSZ1G139.61+24 and RXJ1720.1+2638, which is not observed around the mini halo in the non-cool-core cluster A1413. We also discover a new 570 kpc-halo in the non- cool-core cluster RXCJ0142.0+2131.
    * We conclude that radio emission in non-merging massive clusters is not common at the sensitivity level reached by our observations and that no clear connection with the cluster dynamical state is observed.

#### [The LOFAR Two-metre Sky Survey - II. First data release](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.07926)
    - **Important**
    * The LOFAR Two-metre Sky Survey (LoTSS) is an ongoing sensitive, high-resolution 120-168MHz survey of the entire northern sky for which observations are now 20% complete.
    * A total of 325,694 sources are detected with a signal of at least five times the noise, and the source density is a factor of ∼10 higher than the most sensitive existing very wide-area radio-continuum surveys.
    * The median sensitivity is S144MHz=71μJy beam−1 and the point-source completeness is 90% at an integrated flux density of 0.45mJy. The resolution of the images is 6″ and the positional accuracy is within 0.2″

#### [The LOFAR Two-metre Sky Survey (LoTSS) III. First Data Release: optical/IR identifications and value-added catalogue](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.07927)
    * We present the source associations and optical and/or IR identifications for sources in the first data release, which are made using a combination of statistical techniques and visual association and identification
    * The final LoTSS-DR1-IDs value-added catalogue presented contains 318,520 radio sources, of which 231,716 (73%) have optical and/or IR identifications in Pan-STARRS and WISE.


#### [The LOFAR Two-metre Sky Survey IV. First Data Release: Photometric redshifts and rest-frame magnitudes](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.07927)
    * In this paper we present photometric redshifts (photo-z) for 94.4% of optical sources over this region that are detected in the Panoramic Survey Telescope and Rapid Response System (Pan-STARRS) 3π steradian survey.
    * Combining the Pan-STARRS optical data with mid-infrared photometry from the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer, we estimate photo-zs using a novel hybrid photometric redshift methodology optimised to produce the best possible performance for the diverse sample of radio continuum selected sources.


#### [The LOFAR Two-metre Sky Survey IV. First Data Release: Photometric redshifts and rest-frame magnitudes](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.07927)
    - **Relevant, Interesting**
    * In preparation for a larger study, we selected three clusters -- Abell 1319, Abell 1314, and RXC J1501.3+4220 (Z7215) -- making use of the new LOFAR Two-Metre Sky Survey (LoTSS) at 120-168 MHz, and together with archival data, show that these clusters appear to be in pre-merging, merging, and post-merging states, respectively.
    * Systematic studies of this kind over a larger sample of clusters observed with LoTSS will help constrain the time scales involved in turbulent re-acceleration and the subsequent energy losses of the underlying electrons.


#### [The origin of radio emission in broad absorption line quasars: Results from the LOFAR Two-metre Sky Survey](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.07931)
    * We find that BALQSOs are twice as likely to be detected at 144MHz than their non-BAL counterparts, and BALQSOs with low-ionisation species present in their spectra are three times more likely to be detected than those with only high-ionisation species.
    * The BALQSO fraction at 144MHz is constant with increasing radio luminosity, which is inconsistent with previous results at 1.4GHz, indicating that observations at the different frequencies may be tracing different sources of radio emission.
    * The LDR1-detected BALQSOs in our sample are almost exclusively radio-quiet (\logr <2), with radio sizes at 144MHz typically less than 200kpc; these radio sizes tend to be larger than those at 1.4GHz, suggesting more extended radio emission at low frequencies.


#### [LoTSS/HETDEX: Disentangling star formation and AGN activity in gravitationally-lensed radio-quiet quasars](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.07932)
    * Here, we present the detection of the gravitationally-lensed radio-quiet quasars SDSS J1055+4628, SDSS J1313+5151 and SBS 1520+530 at 144 MHz that fall in the HETDEX Spring Field targeted in the LOFAR Two-metre Sky Survey (LoTSS) first full data release
    * Their radio luminosities can be explained by star formation.
    * These detections represent the first study of gravitationally lensed sources with LOFAR, opening a new frequency window for investigating the star-forming properties of high-redshift quasars at radio wavelengths


#### [LoTSS/HETDEX: Disentangling star formation and AGN activity in gravitationally-lensed radio-quiet quasars](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.07932)
    * To date, radio emission in quasars has been investigated almost exclusively using high-frequency observations in which the Doppler boosting might have an important effect on the measured radio luminosity, whereas extended structures, best observed at low radio frequencies, are not affected by the Doppler enhancement.
    * The examination of the radio continuum emission and RL/RQ dichotomy in quasars exhibits that quasars show a wide continuum of radio properties (i.e. no clear bimodality in the distribution of R). Radio continuum emission at low frequencies in low-luminosity quasars is consistent with being dominated by star formation.

#### [LOFAR observations of the XMM-LSS field](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.07942)
    * The low elevation of this field reduces the effective collecting area of the telescope, thereby reducing sensitivity. This low elevation also causes the primary beam to be elongated in the north-south direction


#### [Radio-loud AGN in the first LoTSS data release: The lifetimes and environmental impact of jet-driven sources](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.07943)
    * We constructed a sample of 23,344 radio-loud active galactic nuclei (RLAGN) from the catalogue derived from the LOFAR Two-Metre Sky Survey (LoTSS) survey of the HETDEX Spring field
    * We show that large or giant powerful RLAGN are probably the old tail of the general RLAGN population, but that the low-luminosity RLAGN candidates in our sample, many of which have sizes <100 kpc, either require a very different lifetime distribution or have different jet physics from the more powerful objects
    * We show that RLAGN in the local Universe are able to supply all the energy required per comoving unit volume to counterbalance X-ray radiative losses from groups and clusters and thus prevent the hot gas from cooling.


#### [The environments of radio-loud AGN from the LOFAR Two-Metre Sky Survey (LoTSS)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.07949)
    - **Interesting**
    * We cross-matched 8,745 radio-loud AGN with 0.08<z<0.4, selected from LoTSS, with two Sloan Digital Sky Survey cluster catalogues, and find that only 10 percent of LoTSS AGN in this redshift range have an association, so that the majority of low-redshift AGN (including a substantial fraction of the most radio-luminous objects) must inhabit haloes with M < 10^14 M_sun.
    * We find that the probability of a cluster association, and the richness of the associated cluster, is correlated with AGN radio luminosity, and for the cluster population, the number of associated AGN and the radio luminosity of the brightest associated AGN is richness-dependent.
    * At the lowest radio luminosities we find that the minority of objects with a cluster association are located at larger mean cluster-centre distances than more luminous AGN, which appears to be driven primarily by host-galaxy mass
    * Finally, we also find that FRI radio galaxies inhabit systematically richer environments than FRIIs.


#### [Calibrating the relation of low-frequency radio continuum to star formation rate at 1 kpc scale with LOFAR](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.07968)
    * 射电连续谱测SFR不受尘埃消光干扰，低频部分还不被射电热辐射污染 (free-free emision)
    * We calibrate the conversion from the spatially resolved 140 MHz RC emission to the SFR surface density (ΣSFR) at 1 kpc scale. We used recent observations of three galaxies (NGC 3184, 4736, and 5055) from the LOFAR Two-metre Sky Survey (LoTSS), and archival LOw-Frequency ARray (LOFAR) data of NGC 5194
    * The RC emission is smoothed with respect to the hybrid ΣSFR owing to the transport of cosmic-ray electrons (CREs).
    * We then simulate the effect of CRE transport by convolving the hybrid ΣSFR maps with a Gaussian kernel until the RC-SFR relation is linearised; CRE transport lengths are l=1-5 kpc.
    * A RC-SFR relation at 1.4 GHz can be exploited to measure SFRs at redshift z≈10 using 140 MHz observations.


#### [The first detection of radio recombination lines at cosmological distances](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.08104)
    * 低频射电复合线观测提供了独到的探测星系中冷-中性气体和热-电离气体的能力，可以用来确定线发射区域的温度和密度；这些线主要来自C和H
    * With LOFAR observations of the radio quasar 3C 190 (z=1.1946), we aim to demonstrate that the ISM can be explored out to great distances through low-frequency RRLs.  We report the detection of RRLs in the frequency range 112--163 MHz in the spectrum of 3C 190
    * We consider three interpretations of the origin of the RRL emission: an intervening dwarf-like galaxy, an AGN-driven outflow, and the inter-galactic medium. We argue that the RRLs most likely originate in a dwarf-like galaxy (M ~ 1e9 Msun) along the line of sight


#### [LoTSS DR1: Double-double radio galaxies in the HETDEX field](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.08194)
    * DDRG: 高能射电噪活动星系核生命周期中短暂和独特的一个阶段，前一次Jet活动停止，在IGM中留下了大尺度的残留射电辐射；新的射点活动周期又刚刚开始, 有两个射电瓣; 星系整体性质和非double的射电星系没有区别，导致jet停止又启动的原因应该不是星系的活动，而是黑洞附近吸积状态的变化
    * To confirm the restarted nature in each of the candidate sources, we obtained follow-up observations with the VLA at higher resolution to observe the inner lobes or restarted jets, the confirmation of which created a robust sample of 33 DDRGs.
    * We find that there is no statistically significant difference in the brightness of the host galaxies between double-doubles and single-cycle RLAGN. The DDRG and RLAGN samples also have similar distributions in WISE mid-infrared colours, indicating similar ages of stellar populations and dust levels in the hosts of DDRGs
    * Restarted jets, particularly for the class of low-excitation radio galaxies, rather than being a product of a particular event in the life of a host galaxy, must instead be caused by smaller scale changes, such as in the accretion system surrounding the black hole.

#### [The intergalactic magnetic field probed by a giant radio galaxy](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.7934)
    * we present the Faraday rotation measure (RM) and depolarisation properties of the giant radio galaxy J1235+5317, at a redshift of z=0.34 and 3.38 Mpc in size.
    * From a catalogue of LSS filaments based on optical spectroscopic observations in the local universe, we find an excess of filaments intersecting the line of sight to only one of the lobes.
    * Associating the entire RM difference to these LSS filaments leads to a gas density-weighted IGMF strength of ~0.3 {\mu}G. However, direct comparison with cosmological simulations of the RM contribution from LSS filaments gives a low probability (~5%) for an RM contribution as large as 2.5 rad/m2 可能有银河系的贡献


#### [Close-up view of an ongoing merger between the NGC 4839 group and the Coma cluster - a post-merger scenario](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.7934)
    * X-ray data show two prominent features: (i) a long (~600 kpc in projection) and bent tail of cool gas trailing (towards south-west) the optical center of NGC 4839, and ii) a "sheath" region of enhanced X-ray surface brightness enveloping the group, which is due to hotter gas.
    * While at first glance the X-ray images suggest that we are witnessing the first infall of NGC 4839 into the Coma cluster core, we argue that a post-merger scenario provides a better explanation of the observed features and illustrate this with a series of numerical simulations.


#### [The First Swift Intensive AGN Accretion Disk Reverberation Mapping Survey](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.7956)
    * The X-ray/UV correlations are much weaker than those within the UV/optical, posing severe problems for the lamp-post reprocessing model in which variations in a central X-ray corona drive and power those in the surrounding accretion disk.
    * The UV/optical interband lags are generally consistent with τ∝λ4/3 as predicted by the centrally illuminated thin accretion disk model.
    * The one exception is the U band lags, which are on average a factor of ∼2.2 larger than predicted from the surrounding band data and fits. This excess appears due to diffuse continuum emission from the broad-line region (BLR).


#### [Blazars in the LOFAR Two-Metre Sky Survey First Data Release](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.7956)
    * We identified radio counterparts to all 98 known sources from the Third \textit{Fermi}-LAT Point Source Catalogue (3FGL) or Roma-BZCAT Multi-frequency Catalogue of Blazars (5th edition) that fall within the LDR1 footprint.
    * We examined the redshift and radio luminosity distributions of our sample, finding flat-spectrum radio quasars (FSRQs) to be more distant and more luminous than BL Lacertae objects (BL Lacs) on average.
    * Blazars are known to have flat spectra in the gigahertz regime but we found this to extend down to 144 MHz

#### [Atomic gas fractions in active galactic nucleus host galaxies](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.08448)
    * We investigate fgas for 75 AGN host galaxies in the extended GALEX Arecibo SDSS Survey (xGASS), whose atomic gas fractions are complete to a few percent.
    * We construct H i spectral stacks of 1562 AGN from the Arecibo Legacy Fast ALFA (ALFALFA) survey, which enables us to extend the AGN sample to lower stellar masses.
    * AGN hosts with log (M⋆/M⊙) >10.2 are H i rich by a factor of ∼ 2. However, this gas fraction excess disappears when the control sample is additionally matched in star formation rate (SFR), indicating that these AGN hosts are actually H i normal
    * At lower stellar mass, the stacking analysis reveals that AGN hosts are H i poor at fixed stellar mass.

    * We newly discovered 10 quasars with −25<M1450<−23 at z∼5, among which three have been missed in a previous survey using the same optical data over the same area, implying the necessity for improvements in high redshift faint quasars selection.

    * Follow-up UV space spectroscopy of the Lyα region shows that all ten have damped Lyα (DLA) absorption,
    * The result is a representative sample of the highest Zn+ columns of gas within the DLA population. These ZnII-selected systems define the upper envelope of DLA metallicities near z=1.2.


#### [Ultra-steep spectrum emission in the merging galaxy cluster Abell 1914](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.08450)

    * Our analysis shows that the ultra-steep spectrum source (4C38.39; α≲−2), previously thought to be part of a radio halo, is a distinct source with properties that are consistent with revived fossil plasma sources.

    * These correlations do not appear to be expected in standard hierarchical galaxy formation. 本文用DM-only模拟研究
    * For this sample, we find an average trend (though with very large scatter) similar to the one observed in the LG; disk galaxies in heavier halos on average host heavier bulges and larger number of satellites.

    * At these high luminosities (g < 20.85 quasars), the MBII simulation volume (100 cMpc/h comoving boxsize) has only 3 quasar pairs at distances of 1 − 4 Mpc.
    * By modeling the central and satellite AGN CLFs as log-normal and Schechter distributions respectively (as seen in MBII AGNs), we arrive at CLF models which fit the simulation predictions and observed measurements of the luminosity function and the small-scale clustering measured for the SDSS samaple.
    * The small-scale clustering of our mock quasars is well-explained by central-satellite quasar pairs

    * 12 new candidates: Ten were rejected as core-jet or core-hotspot(s) systems

#### [The echo of the bar buckling: phase-space spirals in Gaia DR2](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.09205)
    * We use a self-consistent N-body simulation of an isolated Milky Way-type galaxy to show that the phase-space spirals develop naturally from vertical oscillations driven by the buckling of the stellar bar.
    * We claim that the physical mechanism standing behind the observed incomplete phase-space mixing process can be internal and not necessarily due to the perturbation induced by a massive satellite.
    * Once bending waves appear, they are supported for a long time via disk self-gravity. The underlying physical mechanism implies the link between in-plane and vertical motion that leads directly to phase-space structures whose amplitude and shape are in remarkable agreement with those of the phase-space spirals observed in the Milky Way disk

    * we employ near-infrared diagnostics such as Brγ and the ro-vibrationally excited H2 lines to quantify the nuclear star formation rate and identify feedback associated with shocked molecular gas seen in 21 nearby luminous infrared galaxies.
    * Shocked molecular gas is preferentially found in the ultraluminous infrared systems, but may also be triggered at a lower-luminosity, earlier merging stage.
    * On circumnuclear scales, AGN have a strong effect on heating the surrounding molecular gas, though their coupling is not simply driven by AGN strength but rather is complicated by orientation, dust shielding, density, and other factors.


#### [Starvation as the primary quenching mechanism in galaxies](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.09283)
    - **Relevant**
    * Our analysis reveals that the star-forming progenitors of massive (M∗ ∼ 10^11 M⊙) local passive galaxies quenched primarily through starvation over a time-scale of 2 Gyr, before any future star formation was abruptly halted by an ejective or heating mode.
    * Outflows played a minor role in quenching the progenitors of massive galaxies, but were of increasing importance in quenching the progenitors of low-mass
    * We find that the quenching of central galaxies is independent of the environment. In contrast, we find that environmental effects contributed to the starvation of low-mass satellite galaxies in very dense environments.

    * The misalignment fraction is 45 ± 6% in early-type galaxies, but only 5 ± 1% in late-type galaxies.
    * Slower dynamical settling time of the gas in elliptical stellar mass distributions accounts for a small increase in misalignment in early-type galaxies. 但不足以解释全部的形态差异
    * LTGs have primarily accreted gas close to aligned rather than settled from misaligned based on analysis of the skewed distribution of PA offsets compared to a dynamical settling model. LTG吸积的气体一般就是aligned。。。但是为什么气体一定是吸积来的?
    * Cluster environments are found to have gas misalignment driven primarily by cluster processes not by gas accretion.


#### [Interpretation of Departure from the Broad Line Region Scaling in Active Galactic Nuclei](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.09559)
    * A significant fraction of objects exhibit shorter lags than the previously found scaling of the time delay of the Hβ emission region with the monochromatic flux at 5100A ̊
    * These shorter largs can be explained by the old concept of scaling of the BLR size with the ionization paramete


#### [The Foundation Supernova Survey: Measuring Cosmological Parameters with Supernovae from a Single Telescope](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.09286)
    * Here, we combine the Foundation sample with SNe from the Pan-STARRS Medium Deep Survey and measure cosmological parameters with 1,338 SNe from a single telescope and a single, well-calibrated photometric system.
    * For the first time, both the low-z and high-z data are predominantly discovered by surveys that do not target pre-selected galaxies, reducing selection bias uncertainties
    * By combining the SN Ia data with cosmic microwave background constraints, we find w=−0.938±0.053, consistent with ΛCDM. With 463 spectroscopically classified SNe Ia alone, we measure w=−0.933±0.061.


#### [Deviations from tidal torque theory: environment dependences on halo angular momentum growth](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.09487)
    * The tidal torque theory (TTT) naturally relates the origin and evolution of angular momentum with the environment in which dark matter (DM) haloes form. However, the non-linear evolution of haloes introduces deviations that are commonly thought as noise in the theory.
    * We find that the classification of DM haloes according to their angular momentum growth results in samples with different internal alignment and spin parameter distributions
    * low mass haloes are embedded in denser environments if they have acquired angular momentum below the TTT expectations, whereas the opposite occurs at high masses, where higher angular momentum growths are typically associated with more clustering


#### [Dark Quest. I. Fast and Accurate Emulation of Halo Clustering Statistics and Its Application to Galaxy Clustering](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.09504)

    * We develop an emulator, Dark Emulator, which enables fast and accurate computations of halo clustering quantities, the halo mass function, halo-matter cross-correlation, and halo auto-correlation as a function of halo masses, redshift, separations and cosmological models, based on the Principal Component Analysis and the Gaussian Process Regression


#### [First Cosmology Results Using Type Ia Supernovae From the Dark Energy Survey: Survey Overview and Supernova Spectroscopy](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.09565)

#### [KiDS+GAMA: Intrinsic alignment model constraints for current and future weak lensing cosmology](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.09598)
    - **Relevant**
    * We measure the projected galaxy position-intrinsic shear correlations and the projected galaxy clustering signal using high-resolution imaging from the Kilo Degree Survey (KiDS) overlapping with the GAMA spectroscopic survey
    * Separating samples by colour, we make no significant detection of blue galaxy alignments
    * We make robust detections (∼9σ) for red galaxies, with ARIA=3.35+0.50−0.50, corresponding to a net radial alignment with the galaxy density field
    * Our results indicate, however, that the modelling of red/blue-split galaxy alignments may be insufficient to describe samples with variable central/satellite galaxy fractions.

    * Only 12±5\% of the stream density variations can be attributed to the sub-halos below 4x10^8 M_sun. The dominant source of density variations in streams is the varying tidal fields along the complex trajectories of the clusters and their streams as the galaxy assembles.

    - **Interesting**
    * Depending on the redshift distribution of FRBs and using the repeating FRB121102 as a model, we calculate a detection rate of multiply-imaged FRBs with their multiply-imaged hosts caused by the distribution of galaxy-cluster scale gravitational lenses of the order of 10−4 per square degree per year
    * Our comparison of estimated detection rates for quasars, supernovae, gamma ray bursts, and FRBs shows that multiple images of FRBs could be more numerous than those of gamma ray bursts and supernovae and as numerous as multiple images of quasars.
    * Time delays between the multiple images of an FRB break degeneracies in model-based and model-independent lens reconstructions as other time-varying sources do, yet without a microlensing bias as FRBs are more point-like and have shorter duration times.

    * These models are characterised by a cutoff in the linear power spectrum, followed by a series of 'dark acoustic oscillations' (DAOs) on sub-dwarf scales.

    * We examine how the equivalent widths of [O II]λλ3727, 3730, Hβ, [O III]λλ4960, 5008, [O III] + Hβ, Hα, and Hα + [N II]λλ6550, 6585, depend on stellar mass, UV slope, age, star-formation rate (SFR) and specific SFR (sSFR), ionization parameter and excitation conditions (O32 and [O III]/Hβ), gas- phase metallicity, and ionizing photon production efficiency (ξion).
    * The trend of increasing W with decreasing stellar mass is strongest for [O III] (and [O III]+Hβ).

    * The companion galaxy M51b, however, shows a deficit of [C ii] emission compared with the TIR emission and SFR surface density

#### [The large and small scale properties of the intergalactic gas in the Slug Ly-alpha nebula revealed by MUSE HeII emission observations](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.11783)

    * He ii/Lyα gradient is due to large variations in the physical distances between the associated quasar and these regions. This implies that the overall length of the emitting structure could extend to physical Mpc scales and be mostly oriented along our line of sight.
    * These results strengthen the possibility that the density distribution of intergalactic gas at high-redshift is extremely clumpy and multiphase on scales below our current observational spatial resolution of a few physical kpc.


#### [Dwarf Galaxies in CDM, WDM, and SIDM: Disentangling Baryons and Dark Matter Physics](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.11791)

    * the inclusion of self-interactions does little to affect the mass assembly of these halos (both dark matter and baryonic), while WDM mod- els generally delay dark matter halo formation and reduce galaxies’ stellar masses at z = 0.
    * Spatially-resolved rotation curves in the central regions (< 400 pc) of small dwarfs could provide a way to distinguish between CDM, WDM, and SIDM: at the masses probed in this simulation suite, cored density profiles in dwarfs with small r1/2 values can only originate from dark matter self-interactions.

    * A total of 22,426 Globular cluster candidates were selected through a detailed morphological inspection and the analysis of their magnitude and colors in two wavebands, F475W (Sloan g) and F814W (I).
    * The spatial distribution of globular clusters defines three main overdensities in Coma that can be associated with NGC 4889, NGC 4874, and IC 4051 but have spatial scales five to six times larger than individual galaxies.
    * Intracluster globular clusters also form clear bridges between Coma galaxies. Red globular clusters, which agglomerate around the center of the three main subgroups, reach higher surface densities than blue ones.

    * We report the initial discovery and spectroscopic confirmation of six new luminous quasars at z > 6.4, including an object at z = 7.02, the fourth quasar yet known at z > 7, from a small fraction of candidates observed thus far.
    * Based on the recent measurement of z ∼ 6.7 quasar luminosity function using the quasar sample from our survey in the northern sky, we estimate that there will be 􏰇 55 quasars at z > 6.5 at M1450 < −24.5 in the full DES footprint.

    * The IFRS redshift distribution overlaps with the high-z radio galaxy (HzRG) redshift distribution but is significantly narrower, suggesting that the IFRSs are a subset of the larger class of HzRGs

#### [The Ultraviolet Detection of Diffuse Gas in Galaxy Groups](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.12374)

    * At group-centric impact parameters of 0.3-2 Mpc, these S/N=15-30 spectra detected HI absorption in 7 of 12 groups; high (OVI) and low (SiIII) ion metal lines are present in 2/3 of the absorption components. None of the three most highly-virialized, ETG-dominated groups are detected in absorption.
    * Covering fractions ≳50% are seen at all impact parameters probed, but do not require large filling factors despite an enormous extent.
