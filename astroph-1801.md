    * We clearly detect a population of blue FUV-NUV BCGs in the redshift range 0.10-0.35
    * The existence of a large number of UV upturns around redshift 0.25 favors the existence of a binary channel among the sources proposed in the literature.

#### [Dark Matter Substructure in Numerical Simulations: A Tale of Discreteness Noise, Runaway Instabilities, and Artificial Disruption](https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.05427)
    - **Important, Relevant**
    * We confirm the conclusions from our more analytical assessment in van den Bosch et al. that most disruption is numerical in origin; as long as a subhalo is resolved with sufficient mass and force resolution, a bound remnant survives.
    * This implies that state-of-the-art cosmological simulations still suffer from significant overmerging. We demonstrate that this is mainly due to inadequate force-softening, which causes ex- cessive mass loss and artificial tidal disruption.

#### [The resolved stellar populations in the LEGUS galaxies](https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.05467)
    * we present the photometric catalogs for all the apparently single stars identified in the 50 LEGUS galaxies.
    * Our analysis shows that the fraction of massive stars forming in star clusters and stellar associations is about constant with the star formation rate.
    *  At low star formation rates this translates to an excess of mass in clustered environments as compared to model predictions of cluster evolution, suggesting that a significant fraction of stars form in unbound systems.


#### [Timing the formation and assembly of early-type galaxies via spatially resolved stellar populations analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.05486)
    **Relevant**
    * We find rather flat age and [Mg/Fe] radial gradients, weakly dependent on the effective velocity dispersion of the galaxy within half-light radius.
    * metallicity gradients become steeper with increasing galaxy velocity dispersion.
    * we find a tight age-[Mg/Fe] relation, supporting that the duration of the star formation is the main driver of the [Mg/Fe] enhancement in massive ETGs.

#### [The origin of ICM enrichment in the outskirts of present-day galaxy clusters from cosmological hydrodynamical simulations](https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.05425)
    * This confirms that the in situ enrichment of the ICM in the outskirts of present-day clusters does not play a significant role, and its uniform metal abundance is rather the consequence of the accretion of both low-metallicity and pre-enriched (at z > 2) gas

    * we find that the fraction of rotation dominated galaxies increases with the stellar mass, and decreases for galaxies with a positive offset from the main sequence (higher specific star formation rate).

    * merger-induced outflows can increase the CGM metallicity by 0.2−0.3 dex within 0.5 Gyr post-merger.

    * 按模拟里看，UDF也有可能有satellite，但是现在可能看不到

    * Compared to the current AGN luminosity, the energy budget of the cloud implies a luminosity drop in Mrk463E by a factor 3–20 over the last 40,000 years.

    * While Coma P has regions of dense HI gas reaching the NHI = 10^21 cm−2 level typically associated with ongoing star formation, it lacks massive star formation as traced by Hα emission.
    * The HI kinematics are extremely complex: a simple model of a rotating disk cannot describe the HI gas in Coma P.

#### [Galactic disk winds driven by cosmic ray pressure](https: //arxiv.org/abs/1801.06544)
    * Cosmic ray pressure gradients transfer energy and momentum to extraplanar gas in disk galaxies, potentially driving significant mass loss as galactic winds. This may be particularly important for launching high-velocity outflows of “cool” (T 􏰬 104 K) gas.
    * Cosmic ray streaming at the Alfvn speed enables the effective sound speed Ceff to increase from the footpoint to a critical point (一般在李盘1-6 kpc处)

    * 旋转曲线上升很陡，peak在1kpc处，然后变平下降
    * face-on测量的气体速度弥散度和近邻星系类似，比高红移星系低


#### [Elemental gas-phase abundances of intermediate redshift type Ia supernova star-forming host galaxies](https: //arxiv.org/abs/1801.06547)
    * The maximum luminosity of type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) depends on the oxygen abun- dance of the regions of the host galaxies where they explode.
    * We find a trend of decreasing oxygen abundance with increasing redshift for the most massive galaxies.


#### [ALMA Reveals an Inhomogeneous Compact Rotating Dense Molecular Torus at the NGC 1068 Nucleus](https: //arxiv.org/abs/1801.06564)
    * we have detected the rotation of this compact emission, with the eastern and western sides being redshifted and blueshifted, respectively.
    * HCN J=3–2 and HCO+ J=3–2能比较好的探测torus附近分子气体的运动学
    * The dense molecular gas in the torus and that of the host galaxy from the AGN along the torus direction are found to be counter-rotating, suggesting an external process happened in the past at the NGC 1068 nucleus.


#### [The SAMI Galaxy Survey: gas content and interaction as the drivers of kinematic asymmetry](https: //arxiv.org/abs/1801.06628)
    * We find that local environment, measured as distance to nearest neighbour, is inversely correlated with kinematic asymmetry for galaxies with log(M∗/M⊙) > 10.0, but there is no significant correlation for galaxies with log(M∗/M⊙) < 10.0.
    * secular effects derived from gas fraction and gas mass may be the primary causes of asymmetry in low mass galaxies.


#### [A Dust spectral energy distribution model with hierarchical Bayesian inference. I. Formalism & benchmarking](https: //arxiv.org/abs/1801.06660)
    - **Tool**
    * HerBIE: The originality of this code is to apply the hierarchical Bayesian approach to full dust models, including realistic optical properties, stochastic heating and the mixing of physical conditions in the observed regions.


#### [A multiwavelength survey of HI-excess galaxies with surprisingly inefficient star formation](https: //arxiv.org/abs/1801.06880)
    * outliers in the gas fraction vs. NUV r color and stellar mass surface density scaling relations based on the GALEX Arecibo SDSS Survey (GASS).
    * multiple possible reasons for the H I excess in these systems.


#### [Emission-line diagnostics of nearby HII regions including interacting binary populations](https: //arxiv.org/abs/1801.07068)
    - **Important**
    * at population ages above 10 Myr, single-star models rapidly decrease in flux and ionization strength, while binary-star model still produce strong flux and high O III/H  ratios.
    * we find higher metallicities than previously estimated for the H II regions from dwarf galaxies.
    * Comparing the equivalent width of H  emission between mod- els and observations, we find that accounting for ionizing photon leakage can a↵ect age estimates for HII regions


#### [Cospatial Star Formation and Supermassive Black Hole Growth in z∼3 Galaxies: Evidence for In-situ Co-evolution](https: //arxiv.org/abs/1801.07072)
    * a sub-kpc localization of the sites of supermassive black hole (SMBH) growth in three active galactic nuclei (AGN) at z~3 in relation to the regions of intense star formation in their hosts.
    * AGN are located within the compact regions of gas-rich, heavily obscured, intense nuclear star formation


#### [Inner and outer star forming regions over the disks of spiral galaxies. I. Sample characterization](https: //arxiv.org/abs/1801.07126)
    * 725 inner H ii regions and a sample of 671 outer H ii regions, all of them detected and extracted from the observations of a sample of 263 nearby, isolated, spiral galaxies observed by the CALIFA survey..
    * inner H ii regions show smaller equivalent widths, greater extinction and luminosities, along with greater values of [N ii] λ6583/Hα and [O ii] λ3727/[O iii] λ5007 emission-line ratios, indicating higher metallicites and lower ionization parameters.


#### [Probing galaxy assembly bias with LRG weak lensing observations](https: //arxiv.org/abs/1801.06551)
    * **Relevant**
    * Slow-growing vs. fast-growing LRG: present significantly different clustering properties on scales of 1-30Mpc.
    * We show that fast- and slow-growing LRGs have similar lensing profiles, which implies that they live in haloes of similar mass.

#### [Predicting Quasar Continua Near Lyman-α with Principal Component Analysis](https: //arxiv.org/abs/1801.07679)
    * we opted for a non-parametric predictive approach based on principal component analysis (PCA) to predict the intrinsic spectrum from the spectral properties at redder (i.e. unabsorbed) wavelengths.
    * constructed a projection matrix to predict the blue-side coefficients from a fit to the red-side spectrum.
    * We find that both z > 7 quasars, and in particular ULAS J1342+0928, show signs of damping wing-like absorption at wavelengths redward of Lyα.
