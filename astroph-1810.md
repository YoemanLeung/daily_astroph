#### [The missing light of the Hubble Ultra Deep Field](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.00002)
    - **Relevant, Interesting**
    * We created ABYSS: a pipeline that optimises the estimate and modelling of low-level systematic effects to obtain a robust background subtraction.
    * The new mosaics successfully recover the low surface brightness structure removed on the previous HUDF published reductions.
    * The developed procedures are applicable to HST, JWST, EUCLID and many other space and ground-based observatories.


#### [Jellyfish galaxies with the IllustrisTNG simulations: I. Gas-stripping phenomena in the full cosmological context](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.00005)
    * Among more than about 6 000 (2 600) galaxies with stars (and some gas), we identify 800 jellyfish galaxies by visually inspecting their gas and stellar mass maps in random projections.
    * Namely, about 31 per cent of cluster satellites are found with signatures of ram-pressure stripping and gaseous tails stemming from their main luminous bodies 这还是lower limit
    * The frequency of jellyfish galaxies shows a very weak dependence on redshift (0 ≤ z ≤ 0.6) but larger fractions of disturbed gaseous morphologies occur in more massive hosts and at smaller satellite masses.


#### [MOSFIRE Spectroscopy of Quiescent Galaxies at 1.5 < z < 2.5. II - Star Formation Histories and Galaxy Quenching](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.00008)
    - **Relevant, Important**
    * After subtracting the stellar templates, the stacked spectrum reveals the Hα and [N II] emission lines, providing an upper limit on the ongoing star formation rate of 0.9 ± 0.1 M⊙/yr.
    * Finding a tight relation between the stellar age and the rest-frame U −V and V −J colors, with a scatter of only 0.13 dex.
    * We model the number density evolution and find evidence for two distinct quenching paths: a fast quenching that produces compact, spheroidal post-starburst systems residing in overdense regions; and a slow quenching of larger galaxies.


#### [The Relative Specific Type Ia Supernovae Rate From Three Years of ASAS-SN](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.00011)
    - **Important**
    * 476 SN Ia host: We find that the luminosity distribution of the SNe Ia in our sample is reasonably well described by a Schechter function with a faint-end slope α ≈ 1.5 and a knee M⋆ ≈ −18.0.
    * This shows that the specific SN Ia rate continues rising towards lower masses even in galaxies as small as log(M⋆/M⊙)~7.0
    * We find no strong dependence of the specific SN Ia rate on the star formation activity of the host galaxies


#### [Was the Milky Way a chain galaxy? Using the IGIMF theory to constrain the thin-disk star formation history and mass](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.00034)
    * Here, the shape of the PDMF for stars more massive than 1 M⊙ in combination with the mass density in low-mass stars is used to constrain the current star-formation rate (SFR), the star formation history (SFH) and the current stellar plus remnant mass (M∗) in the Galactic thin disk
    * The invariant canonical IMF can reproduce the PDMF of the Galaxy as well as the IGIMF, but in the universal IMF framework it is not possible to constrain any of the above Galactic properties.


#### [Changing-Look Quasar Candidates: First Results from Follow-up Spectroscopy](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.00087)
    * Our primary selection requires large-amplitude (|∆g| > 1 mag, |∆r| > 0.5 mag) variability over any of the available time baselines probed by the SDSS and Pan-STARRS 1 surveys.
    * For our adopted S/N threshold on variability of broad Hβ emission, we find 16 new CLQs, yielding a confirmation rate of 􏰑20%.
    * These candidates are at lower Eddington ratio relative to the overall quasar population and support a disk-wind model for the broad line region.


#### [Mildly Suppressed Star Formation in Central Regions of MaNGA Seyfert Galaxies](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.00365)
    * We present spatially-resolved Hα measurements to trace ongoing star formation in Seyfert galaxies
    * From the comparison we find that the star formation rates within central kpc of Seyfert galaxies are mildly suppressed as compared to the matched normal star forming galaxies.


#### [Radio-loud AGN variability from three-dimensional propagating relativistic jets](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.00365)
    * We use the Athena hydrodynamics code to simulate an extensive suite of 54 propagating three-dimensional relativistic jets with wide ranges of input jet velocities and jet-to-ambient matter density ratios.


#### [The rest-frame optical sizes of massive galaxies with suppressed star formation at z~4](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.00543)
    - **Interesting**
    * the rest-frame optical sizes of massive quiescent galaxies (QGs) at z ∼ 4 measured at K′-band with the Infrared Camera and Spectrograph (IRCS) and adaptive optics facility, AO188
    * Compared to lower redshift ones, QGs at z ∼ 4 have smaller physical sizes of effective radii reff = 0.2 to 1.7 kpc. The mean size measured by stacking the four brightest objects, a more robust measurement, is reff = 0.5 kpc.
    * Their size growth is proportional to the square of stellar mass, indicating the size-stellar mass growth driven by minor dry mergers.


#### [The Fornax Deep Survey (FDS) with the VST: V. A size and magnitude limited catalog of dwarf galaxies in the area of the Fornax cluster](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.00550)
    - **Relevant, Useful**
    * Our final catalog includes 14,095 galaxies. We classify 590 galaxies as being likely Fornax cluster galaxies, of which 564 are dwarfs (Mr′ > -18.5 mag) consisting our Fornax dwarf catalog.


#### [Stellar systems in the direction of Pegasus I - I. Low surface brightness galaxies](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.00710)
    - **Relevant**
    * eight of this type of objects (μeff,g′ ≃ 27 mag arcsec−2) towards the group of galaxies PegasusI. They are located, in projection, within a radius of ∼ 200 kpc in the very center of Pegasus I,
    * Assuming that these galaxies are at the distance of Pegasus I, we have found that their sizes are intermediate among similar objects reported in the literature. In particular, we found that three of these galaxies can be classified as ultra-diffuse galaxies and a fourth one displays a nucleus.
    *  We also show that there seems to be a bias effect in the size distributions of the detected LSBs in different environments, in the sense that more distant groups/clusters lack small reff objects,


#### [Nearly all the sky is covered by Lyman-alpha emission around high redshift galaxies](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.00843)
    - **Important**
    * A new window into circumgalactic environments was recently opened with the discovery of ubiquitous extended Lyman-α emission from hydrogen around high-redshift galaxies, facilitated by the extraordinary sensitivity of the MUSE instrument at the ESO Very Large Telescope
    * Here we demonstrate that low surface brightness Lyman-α emission surrounding faint galaxies at redshifts between 3 and 6 adds up to a projected sky coverage of nearly 100%.


#### [nIFTy Galaxy Cluster simulations VI: The gaseous outskirts of galaxy cluster](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.00534)
    * 为什么cluster outskirt重要：marking the transition from the mildly non-linear cosmic web to the highly non-linear, virialised, cluster environment.
    * Our analysis reveals that the ICM in cluster outskirts is relatively insensitive to both choice of code and galaxy formation prescription.
    * Spherically averaged gas density profiles follow the underlying dark matter, scaled by the cosmic baryon fraction, while temperature and velocity profiles show signatures of strong shocks, short-lived interior to the virial radius and longer-lived at larger radii.
    * Our results make clear that cluster outskirts are shaped by large-scale gravitational dynamics and strong, inefficiently radiating, shocks.


#### [The NuSTAR Extragalactic Surveys: unveiling rare, buried AGNs and detecting the contributors to the peak of the Cosmic X-ray Background](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.00010)
    * We report on the results of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) detection by NuSTAR performed in three extragalactic survey fields (COSMOS, UDS, ECDFS) in three hard bands
    * the H2 band (16-24 KeV) directly probing close to the peak of the Cosmic X-ray Background (CXB) returns four significant detections, and two tentative, although not significant, detections are found in the VH band
    * We compute the integral number counts for sources in such bands, which show broad consistency with population synthesis models of the CXB.

## Oct 3:

#### [Evolution of the cold gas properties of simulated post-starburst galaxies](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.00882)
    * EAGLE模拟中的PSB星系：These objects resemble observed high- mass post-starburst galaxies both spectroscopically and in terms of their space density, stellar mass distribution and sizes.
    * vast majority of simulated post-starburst galaxies have significant gas reservoirs, with star-forming gas masses ≈ 10^9 M⊙
    * average galaxy losing ≈90 per cent of its star-forming interstellar medium in only ≈600 Myr.
    * 主要是并合和环境效应导致的快速气体损失，AGN作用其次


#### [Reproducible k-means clustering in galaxy feature data from the GAMA survey](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.00887)
    - **Relevant, Useful**
    * To address this, we apply a robust k-means unsupervised clustering method to feature data derived from a sample of 7338 local-Universe galaxies selected from the Galaxy And Mass Assembly (GAMA) survey.
    * We find that the local galaxy population natively splits into 2, 3, 5 and a maximum of 6 sub-populations, with each corresponding to a distinct ongo- ing evolutionary mechanism.


#### [Spatially resolved star formation and metallicity profiles in post-merger galaxies from MaNGA](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.00897)
    * By measuring offsets from SFR and metallicity scaling relations on a spaxel-by-spaxel basis, we are able to quantify where in the galaxy these properties are most affected by the interaction.
    * We find that the SFR enhancements are generally centrally peaked, by a factor of 2.5 on average, in agreement with predictions from simulations
    * There is considerable variation in the SFR behaviour in the galactic outskirts, where both enhancement and suppression are seen.


#### [A receding torus model for the Iwasawa-Taniguchi effect for Compton-thick AGN](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.01178)
    * One of the most popular explanations of the classic I-T effect is the so-called receding torus model, i.e. the decrease of the covering factor of the molecular ‘torus’ with X-ray luminosity.
    * an I-T effect for Compton-thick AGN is indeed expected in the receding torus model, assuming that the torus is funnelling the primary X-ray luminosity which is then scattered in a ‘hot mirror’.


#### [The Gemini/HST Galaxy Cluster Project: Stellar Populations in the Low Redshift Reference Cluster Galaxies](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.01199)
    - **Relevant**
    * We present consistently calibrated velocity dispersions and absorption line indices for galaxies in the central 2 R500 × 2 R500 of four massive clusters at z < 0.1: Abell 426/Perseus, Abell 1656/Coma, Abell 2029, and Abell 2142.
    * The data serve as the local reference for our studies of galaxy populations in the higher redshift clusters that are part of the Gemini/HST Galaxy Cluster Project (GCP).


#### [The fraction of bolometric luminosity absorbed by dust in DustPedia galaxies](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.01208)
    - **Important**
    * We study the fraction of stellar radiation absorbed by dust, fabs, in 814 galaxies of different morphological types. CIGALE SED拟合
    * On average, 19% of the stellar radiation is absorbed by dust in DustPedia galaxies. The fraction rises to 25% if only late-type galaxies are considered.
    * We find no variation of fabs with inclination, at odds with radiative transfer models of edge-on galaxies.
    * We confirm that the local Universe is missing the high fabs, luminous and actively star-forming objects necessary to explain the energy budget in observations of the extragalactic background light.


#### [The Star Formation Reference Survey III: A Multi-wavelength View of Star Formation in Nearby Galaxies](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.01336)
    * multi-wavelength global star formation rate (SFR) estimates for 326 galaxies from the Star Formation Reference Survey (SFRS) in order to determine the mutual scatter and range of validity of different indicators.
    * The data prefer a non-linear relation between 1.4 GHz luminosity and other SFR measures.
    * PAH luminosity underestimates SFR for galaxies with strong UV emission.


#### [Revealing a Highly-Dynamic Cluster Core in Abell 1664 with Chandra](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.00881)
    * These images reveal rich structure, including elongation and accompanying compressions of the X-ray isophotes in the NE-SW direction, suggesting that the hot gas is sloshing in the gravitational potential.
    * Our results indicate that the core of A1664 is highly disturbed, as the global metallicity and cooling time flatten at small radii, implying mixing on large scales.
    * These cavities are the X-ray manifestations of radio bubbles inflated by the AGN, and may explain the motion of cold molecular CO clouds previously observed with ALMA.
    * 中央有Cavity：These cavities are the X-ray manifestations of radio bubbles inflated by the AGN, and may explain the motion of cold molecular CO clouds previously observed with ALMA.
    * We map temperature variations on the same spatial scale as the molecular gas, and find that the most rapidly cooling gas is mostly coincident with the molecular gas reservoir centered on the BCG’s systemic velocity observed with ALMA and may be fueling cold accretion onto the central black hole.


#### [Broadband Intensity Tomography: Spectral Tagging the Cosmic UV Background](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.00885)
    - **Interesting**
    * Broadband intensity mapping会损失红移信息，可以从空间起伏中试图重现：exploiting information in spatial fluctuations and apply it to the GALEX All Sky and Medium Imaging Surveys
    * By spatially cross-correlating photons in the GALEX far-UV (1500 Å) and near-UV (2300 Å) bands with a million spectroscopic objects in SDSS as a function of redshift, we robustly detect the redshift-dependent intensity of the UV background (UVB) modulated by its clustering bias up to z ∼ 2.
    * These measurements clearly reveal the imprints of UVB spectral features redshifting through the filters.


#### [Radio-Optical Galaxy Shape and Shear Correlations in the COSMOS Field using 3 GHz JVLA Observations](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.01220)
    * weak lensing analysis of the 3 GHz JVLA radio survey of the COSMOS field, which we correlate with overlapping HST-ACS optical observations using both intrinsic galaxy shape and cosmic shear correlation statistics
    * After cross-matching sources between the two catalogues, we measure the correlations of galaxy position angles and find a Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.14 ± 0.03
    * The optical-optical auto-power weak lensing spectrum was measured to a detection significance of 9.80σ and is consistent with previous observations of the same field
    * Radio weak lensing的优势：These features include the use of radio polarisation information to mitigate the effects of intrinsic alignments (Brown & Battye 2011), the precisely known and stable beam response (or Point Spread Function, PSF) of radio interferometers, and the use of radio-optical cross-correlation statistics to eliminate unaccounted-for systematic effects (Patel et al. 2010; Demetroullas & Brown 2016; Camera et al. 2017).

## Oct 4:

#### [ALMACAL V: Absorption-selected galaxies with evidence for excited ISMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.01418)
    * 用ALMA CO研究QSO吸收线挑选的富气体星系：The CO spectral line energy distribution (CO SLED) of these galaxies appear distinct from that of typical star-forming galaxies at similar redshifts and is comparable with that of luminous infrared galaxies or AGN.
    * We infer that the CO line ratios and the αCO conversion factor differ from the Galactic values.
    * Absorption-line-selection identifies systems with widely distributed gas


#### [J-PLUS: analysis of the intracluster light in the Coma cluster](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.01424)
    - **Relevant**
    * Using a recently developed technique, we measure the ICL fraction in Coma at several wavelengths, using the J-PLUS unique filter system.
    * We use the Chebyshev-Fourier Intracluster Light Estimator (CICLE) to disentangle the ICL from the light of the galaxies, and to robustly measure the ICL fraction in seven J-PLUS filters.
    * We obtain the ICL fraction distribution of the Coma cluster at different optical wavelengths, which varies from ∼ 7% − 21%, showing the highest values in the narrow band filters J0395, J0410, and J0430.
    * the main mechanism of ICL formation for the Coma cluster is the stripping of the stars in the outskirts of infalling galaxies and, possibly, the disruption of dwarf galaxies during past/ongoing mergers.


#### [Time Inference with MUSE in Extragalactic Rings (TIMER): Properties of the Survey and High-Level Data Products](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.01425)
    * TIMER项目：VLT-MUSE integral-field spectrograph of 24 nearby barred galaxies with prominent central structures
    * We illustrate how this dataset can be used for a plethora of scientific applications, e.g., stellar feedback, outflows, nuclear and primary bars, stellar migration and chemical enrichment, and the gaseous and stellar dynamics of nuclear spiral arms, barlenses, box/peanuts and bulges.
    * we show that the dynamics of nuclear rings and inner discs is consistent with the picture in which they are formed by bars, that the central few hundred parsecs in massive disc galaxies tend to show a pronounced peak in stellar metallicity, and that nuclear rings can efficiently prevent star formation in this region.


#### [Tidal Interactions and Mergers in Intermediate Redshift EDisCS Clusters](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.01430)
    - **Relevant**
    * We study the fraction of tidal interactions and mergers with well identified observability timescales (fTIM) in group, cluster, and accompanying field galaxies
    * We find marginal evidence for a trend between fTIM and z, in that higher z values correspond to higher fTIM.
    * fTIM gets boosted in these intermediate density environments.


#### [Ghostly Halos in Dwarf Galaxies: Constraints on the Star Formation Efficiency before Reionization](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.01437)
    * However, if a stellar halo is found in sufficiently small mass dwarfs, the whole stellar halo is composed of tidal debris of fossil galaxies, and we refer to it as ghostly halo.
    * semi-analytical simulations to characterize the sizes and stellar masses of ghostly stellar halos in dwarf galaxies as a function of their dark matter halo mass
    * By comparing the models to observations of six isolated dwarf galaxies in the Local Group showing evidence of extended stellar halos, we are able to constrain the star formation efficiency in fossil galaxies.


#### [The Sloan Digital Sky Survey Reverberation Mapping Project: Sample Characterization](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.01447)
    * a detailed characterization of the 849 broad-line quasars from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Re- verberation Mapping (SDSS-RM) project.

#### [Results of a systematic search for outburst events in 1.4 million galaxies](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.01448)
    * We present an analysis of nine years of Catalina Surveys optical photometry for 1.4 million spectroscopically confirmed SDSS galaxies. We find 717 outburst events that were not re- ported by ongoing transient surveys.
    * we find that almost all of the new events are likely to be associated with regular supernovae. However, a small number of long-timescale events are found among the galaxies containing AGN.


#### [Galaxy Structure, Stellar Populations, and Star Formation Quenching at 0.6 ≲ z ≲ 1.2](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.01498)
    * We have identified authentically quiescent galaxies in the U V J diagram based on their D4000 strengths.
    * We found that bulge-dominated galaxies show positive correlations among the D4000 strength, stellar mass, and the Se ́rsic index, while late-type disks do not show such strong positive correlations.


#### [Concurrent starbursts in molecular gas disks within a pair of colliding galaxies at z = 1.52](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.01595)
    * We report on the discovery of a merger-driven starburst at z = 1.52, PACS-787, based on high signal-to-noise ALMA observations.
    * two compact (r1/2 ∼ 1 kpc) and interacting molecular gas disks at a separation of 8.6 kpc thus indicative of an early stage in a merger.
    * From the CO size, inclination, and velocity profile for both disks, the dynamical mass is calculated through a novel method that incorporates a calibration using simulations of galaxy mergers.
    * The state of interaction is further established by the detection of diffuse CO and continuum emission, tidal debris that bridges the two nuclei and is associated with stellar emission seen by HST/WFC3.


#### [The molecular gas content and fuel efficiency of starbursts at z ~ 1.6 with ALMA](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.01596)
    * We present an analysis of the molecular gas properties, based on CO(2 - 1) emission, of twelve starburst galaxies at z ∼ 1.6 selected by having a boost (  4×) in their star formation rate (SFR) above the average star-forming galaxy at an equivalent stellar mass.
    * As a result of the larger statistical sample, we significantly detect, for the first time at high-z, a systematically lower L′CO/LIR ratio in galaxies lying above the star-forming ‘main sequence’
    * We interpret the results as indicative of the star formation efficiency increasing in a continuous fashion from the MS to the starburst regime, whereas the gas fractions remain comparable to those of MS galaxies.


#### [The relationship between dust and [CI] at z=1 and beyond](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.01640)
    * Dust continuum emission provides a potential alternative assuming a known dust/gas ratio, but this must be calibrated on a direct gas tracer at z > 1.
    * we consider the [Ci] 492-GHz emission line, which has been shown to trace molecular gas closely throughout Galactic clouds and has the advantages of being optically thin in typical conditions
    * We uncover a strong [Ci]–dust correlation, suggesting that both trace similar phases of the gas.
    * theoretical predictions from photo-dissociation region (PDR) modelling suggest that the [Ci]/H2 ratio is robust over a wider range of metallicities and gas densities than CO(1–0)


#### [Mass Functions, Luminosity Functions, and Completeness Measurements from Clustering Redshifts](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.01767)
    - **Relevant, Useful**
    * This paper presents stellar mass functions and i-band luminosity functions for Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) galaxies at i < 21 using clustering redshifts
    * We construct a spectroscopic sample containing data from the BOSS + eBOSS surveys, allowing us to recover redshift distributions from photometric data out to z ≃ 2.5.
    * There is little evolution in the mass function between 0.2 < z < 0.8, implying the most massive galaxies form most of their mass before z = 0.8.


#### [The Interplay of Kinetic and Radiative Feedback in Galaxy Clusters](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.01857)
    * 3D radiation-hydrodynamic simulations with the code Enzo to explore the joint role of the kinetic and radiative feedback from supermassive black holes (SMBHs) in BCGs
    * In our simulations the central SMBH transitions between the radiatively efficient and radiatively inefficient states on time scales of a few Gyr, as a function of its accretion rate.
    * We also find a positive correlation between the AGN feedback power and the mass of the cold gas filaments in the cluster core, indicating that observations of Hα filaments can be used as a measure of AGN feedback.


#### [The XXL Survey XXV. Cosmological analysis of the C1 cluster number counts](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.01624)
    * In a lambda cold dark matter (ΛCDM) model, the cosmology favoured by the XXL clusters compares well with results derived from the Planck S-Z clusters for a totally different sample (mass/redshift range, selection biases, and scaling relations).
    * Combining the two probes allows us to put constraints on Ωm = 0.316 ± 0.060, σ8 = 0.814 ± 0.054, and w = −1.02 ± 0.20.

#### [Formation of Globular Cluster Systems II: Impact of the Cutoff of the Cluster Initial Mass Function](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.01888)
    * 用半解析模型研究Cluster IMF high-mass end的truncates对球状星团形成的影响
    * The cutoff masses of Mc = 10^6.5 M⊙ or 10^7 M⊙ match many scaling relations: between the GC system mass and host halo mass, between the average metallicity of the GC system and host halo mass, and the distribution of cluster masses.
    * In our model the blue tilt arises because the metal-poor clusters form in relatively low-mass galaxies which lack sufficient cold gas to sample the CIMF at highest masses

#### [High-resolution VLA observations of FR0 radio galaxies: properties and nature of compact radio sources](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.01894)
    * FR 0: 主要是ETG中的compact射电源，是近邻射电噪星系中的大多数
    * these are sources at z < 0.05, unresolved in the FIRST images and spectroscopically classified as low excitation galaxies (LEG).
    * 大多数都分解不好: Six have steep radio spectra, 11 are flat cores, while one shows an inverted spectrum.
    * FR 0s share the same properties with FR Is from the nuclear
    * the possibility that all FR 0s are young sources eventually evolving into extended sources is ruled out by the distribution of radio sizes


#### [Early Science with the Large Millimeter Telescope: an energy-driven wind revealed by massive molecular and fast X-ray outflows in the Seyfert Galaxy IRAS 17020+4544](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.01941)
    * a prominent line arising from the 12CO(1-0) transition was revealed in recent observations of this source.
    * The complex profile is composed by a narrow double-peak line and a broad wing. While the double-peak structure may be arising in a disk of molecular material, the broad wing is interpreted as the signature of a massive outflow
    * This molecular wind is likely associated to a multi-component X-ray Ultra-Fast Outflow with velocities reaching up to ∼ 0.1c
    * The momentum load estimated in the two gas phases indicates that within the observational uncertainties the outflow is consistent with being propagating through the galaxy and sweeping up the gas while conserving its energy.


#### [KMTNet Nearby Galaxy Survey I. : Optimal strategy for low surface brightness imaging with KMTNet](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.02075)
    - **Relevant**
    * We present our observing strategy and optimal data reduction process to recover the faint extended features in the imaging data of NGC 1291 taken with KMTNet
    * These results suggest that the deep imaging data produced by KMTNet are suitable to study the faint features of nearby galaxies such as outer disks and dwarf companions, but unideal (not impossible) to detect stellar halos.
    * The one-dimensional profile revealed that NGC 1291 appeared to have Type I disk out to R ∼ 30 kpc with no obvious color gradient and excess light due to a stellar halo was undetected.


#### [The Accretion History of AGN I: Supermassive Black Hole Population Synthesis Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.02298)
    * We present a population synthesis model that accounts for the summed X-ray emission from growing black holes; modulo the efficiency of converting mass to X-rays, this is effectively a record of the accreted mass
    * We need this population synthesis model to reproduce observed constraints from X-ray surveys: the X-ray number counts, the observed fraction of Compton-thick AGN and the spectrum of the Cosmic X-ray “background” (CXB), after accounting for selection biases
    * We find that no existing X-ray luminosity function (XLF) consistently reproduces all these observations.


#### [Baryons in the CosmicWeb of IllustrisTNG - I: Gas in Knots, Filaments, Sheets and Voids](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.01883)
    * We focus on the mass and volume fractions of baryons in different phases in knots, filaments, sheets and voids in the Cosmic Web from redshift z = 8 to red- shift z = 0.
    * Not only we find that filaments host more star-forming gas than knots, but that filaments also have a higher relative mass fraction of gas in this phase than knots.
    * Our results indicate that the WHIM can indeed constitute the largest reservoir of missing baryons at redshift z = 0.
    * in sheets and voids where the cool, diffuse IGM dominates.
    * We predict the existence of a significant number of currently undetected OVII and NeIX absorption systems in cosmic filaments which could be detected by future X-ray telescopes like ATHENA.

#### [Cosmological lensing ratios with DES Y1, SPT and Planck](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.02212)
    * Correlations between tracers of the matter density field and gravitational lensing are sensitive to the evolution of the matter power spectrum and the expansion rate across cosmic time.
    * Appropriately defined ratios of such correlation functions, on the other hand, depend only on the angular diameter distances to the tracer objects and to the gravitational lensing source planes.
    * We present a measurement of lensing ratios using galaxy position and lensing data from the Dark Energy Survey, and CMB lensing data from the South Pole Telescope and Planck, obtaining the highest precision lensing ratio measurements to date.
    * We demonstrate that photometrically selected galaxies can be used to measure lensing ratios, and argue that future lensing ratio measurements with data from a combination of LSST and Stage-4 CMB experiment


#### [Dark Energy Survey Year 1 Results: Joint Analysis of Galaxy Clustering, Galaxy Lensing, and CMB Lensing Two-point Functions](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.02322)
    * Auto and cross-correlations between three cosmic fields: the galaxy density field, the galaxy weak lensing shear field, and the cosmic microwave background (CMB) weak lensing convergence field.
    * We test for consistency between these measurements and the DES-only two-point function measurements, finding no evidence for inconsistency in the context of flat ΛCDM cosmological models.

    * Chandra X-ray observatory data for a sample of 63 luminous infrared galaxies (LIRGs)
    * we find AGN in (31±5)% of the galaxy sample, compared to the (38±6)% previously found for GOALS galaxies with higher infrared luminosities
    * Dual AGN are detected in two systems, implying a dual AGN fraction in systems that contain at least one AGN of (29±14)%, compared to the (11±10)% found for the C-GOALS I sample

    - **Relevant**
    * Present the most precise measurement of these secondary-bias dependencies on halo age, concentration, and spin, for a wide range of halo masses
    * We find no strong evidence of assembly bias for masses above Mvir ∼ 10^14
    * Secondary bias exists, however, for halo concentration and spin, up to cluster-size halos, in agreement with previous findings.
    * Above Mvir ∼10^{11.5} h−1 M⊙, halos with larger values of spin have larger bias, at fixed mass, with the effect reaching almost a factor 2. This trend reverses below this characteristic mass.

    * In agreement with observations we find that star-forming satellite galaxies inside galaxy clusters are characterised by more radially dominated orbits, independent of cluster mass.
    * The tracking of individual orbits shows that almost all satellite galaxies’ star-formation drops to zero within 1 Gyr after infall.


#### [Estimating the Milky Way's Mass via Hierarchical Bayes: A Blind Test on MUGS2 Simulated Galaxies](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.02427)
    * Eadie et al. (2015, 2016, 2017b) developed a hierarchical Bayesian method to estimate the Milky Way Galaxy’s mass given a physical model for the potential, a measurement model, and kinematic data of test particles
    * we test the hierarchical Bayesian method against simulated galaxies created in the McMaster Unbiased Galaxy Simulations 2 (MUGS2), for which the true mass is known.
    * Of the ten galaxy masses that were not recovered within the 95% c.r., a large subset have posterior distributions that occupy extreme ends of the parameter space allowed by the priors. A few incorrect mass estimates are explained by the exceptional evolution history of the galaxies.

#### [Spatially Extended Low Ionization Emission Regions (LIERs) at z∼0.9](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.02819)
    * We present spatially resolved emission diagnostics for eight z ∼ 0.9 galaxies that demonstrate extended low ionization emission-line regions (LIERs) over kpc scales.
    * We modify the traditional Baldwin-Philips-Terlevich (BPT) emission line diagnostic diagram to use [SII]/(Hα+[NII]) instead of [NII]/Hα to overcome the blending of [NII] and Hα+[NII] in the low resolution slitless grism spectra.
    * The extended LINER-like emission present in all of our candidates, coupled with X-Ray properties consistent with star-forming galaxies and weak [OIII]λ5007Å detections, is inconsistent with purely nuclear sources (LINERs) driven by active galactic nuclei.


#### [CLEAR I: Ages and Metallicities of Quiescent Galaxies at 1.0<z<1.8 Derived from Deep Hubble Space  Telescope Grism Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.02824)
    - **Relevant, Important**
    * HST Grism spectra: constrain the metallicities and (light-weighted) ages of massive (logM∗/M⊙ >10) galaxies selected to have quiescent stellar populations at 1.0 < z < 1.8.
    * We simulate a suite of stellar population models at the grism resolution, fit these to the data for each galaxy, and derive posterior likelihood distributions for metallicity and age.
    * This implies that most of the massive quiescent galaxies at 1 < z < 1.8 had formed > 68% of their stellar mass by a redshift of z > 2.
    * This is evidence that massive galaxies had enriched rapidly to approximately Solar metallicities as early as z ∼ 3.


#### [Chemical abundances and radial velocities in the extremely metal-poor galaxy DDO 68](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.02830)
    - **Interesting**; as example of MODS spectra
    * Deep MODS spectra: chemical abundances and radial velocities of six Hii regions in the
extremely metal-poor star-forming dwarf galaxy DDO 68
    * We confirm that DDO 68 is an extremely metal-poor galaxy, and a strong outlier in the luminosity - metallicity relation defined by star-forming galaxies. With the direct-method we find indeed an oxygen abundance of 12+log(O/H)=7.14±0.07 in the northernmost region of the galaxy and, although with large uncertainties, an even lower 12+log(O/H)=6.96±0.09 in the “tail”.
    * 氧丰度梯度是负的 -0.06 to -0.12 depending on methods.
    * For nitrogen, instead, we infer much higher values, leading to log(N/O)∼ −1.4, at variance with the suggested existence of a tight plateau at −1.6 in extremely metal poor dwarfs.


#### [Super-Eddington Accretion in the WISE-Selected Extremely Luminous Infrared Galaxy W2246-0526](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.02933)
    * We use optical and near-infrared spectroscopy to observe rest-UV emission lines and estimate the black hole mass of WISEA J224607.56−052634.9 (W2246−0526) at z = 4.601
    * From the broad component of the Mgii-2799 ̊A emission line, we measure a black hole mass of log(MBH/M⊙) = 9.6 ± 0.4.
    * This high Eddington ratio may reach the level where the luminosity is saturating due to photon trapping in the accretion flow, and be insensitive to the mass accretion rate.


#### [SDSS-IV MaNGA: pattern speeds of barred galaxies](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.03257)
    * We apply the non-parametric method proposed by Tremaine & Weinberg to estimate the bar pattern speed for 53 barred galaxies
    * Combining three independent bar length measurements and the circular velocity from Jeans Anisotropic modelling (JAM), we also determine the dimensionless ratio R of the corotation radius to the bar length.
    * Galaxy’s position angle is the main uncertainty in determining the bar pattern speed.
    * A positive correlation between the bar length and bar strength is found: the longer the bar, the stronger the bar.


#### [The AGN Ionization Cones of NGC 5728 : I - Excitation and Nuclear Structure](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.03258)
    * The complex nuclear structure has a star-forming (SF) ring with a diameter of 2 kpc. A radio jet impacts on the ISM at about 200 pc from the nucleus, with the SN remnants in the SF ring also present.
    * The AGN is hidden by a dust bar with up to 19 magnitudes of visual extinction; the dust temperature at the nuclear position is ∼ 870 K.
    * Molecular hydrogen is spatially independent of the cones, concentrated in a disk equatorial to the star-forming ring, but also showing entrainment along the sides of the bicone.


#### [Evidence for Short ∼1 Myr Lifetimes from the He II Proximity Zones of z∼4 Quasars](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.03258)
    * Quasar lifetime, The duration of quasar accretion episodes, is still uncertain by orders of magnitude (tQ ≃ 0.01 Myr − 1 Gyr).
    * The size of a quasar’s He ii proximity zone, the region near the quasar itself where its own radiation dramatically alters the ionization state of the surrounding intergalactic medium (IGM), depends sensitively on its lifetime for tQ <= 30 Myr
    * We introduce a Bayesian statistical method to infer the lifetimes of individual quasars which allows us to fully marginalize over the unknown ionization state of He ii in the surrounding IGM.

    * We find that the southern cold front exhibits well-developed Kelvin-Helmholtz (KH) eddies seen in the sky plane.
    * we constrain the effective viscosity to be at most 1/5 of Spitzer isotropic viscosity, but consistent with full Braginskii anisotropic viscosity for magnetized plasma.
    * The cool peak itself is displaced ∼30 kpc from the BCG (the biggest such offset among centrally-peaked clusters), while the X-ray emission on a larger scale is still centered on the BCG, indicating that the BCG is at the center of the gravitational potential and the cool gas is sloshing in it.

#### [Volumetric Star Formation laws of disc galaxies](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.03616)
    * Following the assumption of hydrostatic equilibrium, we have calculated the radial growth of the thickeness of the gaseous discs in the combined gravitational potential of dark matter, stars and gas for 12 nearby star-forming galaxies.
    * We found a tight correlation with slope in the range 1.3-1.9 between the volume densities of gas (HI+H2) and of the SFR with a significantly smaller scatter than the surface-based (Kennicutt) law and no change in the slope over five orders of magnitude.
    * The break in the slope seen in the Kennicutt law is due to the disc flaring rather than to inefficiency of star formation at low surface densities.
    * we discovered an unexpected correlation between the volume densities of HI and SFR, indicating that the atomic gas is a good tracer of the cold star-forming gas


#### [X-ray and multi-epoch optical/UV investigations of BAL to non-BAL quasar transformations](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.03625)
    * X-ray and optical/UV study of eight Broad Absorption Line (BAL) to non-BAL transforming quasars at z ≈ 1.7–2.2
    * The X-ray and optical/UV results in tandem are consistent with at least the X-ray absorbing material moving out of the line-of-sight, leaving an X-ray unabsorbed non-BAL quasar.
    * The UV absorber might have become more highly ionized (in a shielding-gas scenario) or also moved out of the line-of-sight (in a wind-clumping scenario).

    * The Herschel Dwarf Galaxy Survey (DGS, Madden etal.2013)
    * The relatively uniform physical properties of the clumps suggest a common origin for their star formation activity, which could be related to the feedback from stellar winds or supernovae of a previous generation of stars.
    * The properties derived for ∼200 pc size "zones" have similar properties as the H ii regions they encompass, but with the larger regions tending to be more radiation-bounded.


#### [No cores in dark matter-dominated dwarf galaxies with bursty star formation histories](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.03635)
    * Earlier work has suggested that core formation requires a bursty and extended star formation history (SFH).
    * APOSTLE和AURIGA模拟中的dwarf星系：we do not find evidence of core formation at any mass or any correlation between the inner slope of the DM density profile and temporal variations in the SFH.
    * We conclude that recurrent bursts of star formation are not sufficient to cause the formation of cores, and that other conditions must also be met for baryons to be able to modify the central DM cusp.


#### [On the structure and energetics of quasar broad absorption-line outflows](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.03686)
    * Quasar accretion-disk outflows might play an important role in galaxy evolution, but they are notoriously difficult to study due to line saturation and blending problems in the Lyα forest.
    * Deeper and broader BALs are accompanied by weaker He ii λ1640 emission lines, consistent with softer ionising spectra leading to enhanced radiative acceleration.
    * For reasonable actual distances, the median BAL outflow has minimum kinetic energy LK /L 􏰓 0.005(R/1.2pc) sufficient (by some estimates) for feedback to galaxy evolution.
    * LoBAL quasars have the largest me- dian outflow column densities, highest velocities, and weakest He ii λ1640 emission in our study; they are at one extreme in a continuum of quasar properties where softer ionising spectra produce more powerful outflows.

    * the Lockman Hole Project - aimed at improving the extensive multi-band coverage available in the Lockman Hole region, through novel deep, wide-area, multi-frequency (60, 150, 350 MHz and 1.4 GHz) radio surveys.
    * novel 1.4 GHz mosaic observations obtained with the Westerbork Synthesis Radio Telescope (WSRT). With an area coverage of 6.6 square degrees, this is the largest survey reaching an rms noise of 11 μJy/b.
    * A clear excess is found with respect to the counts predicted by the semi-empirical radio sky simulations developed in the framework of the SKA Simulated Skies project. A preliminary analysis of the identified (and classified) sources suggests this excess is to be ascribed to star forming galaxies, which seem to show a steeper evolution than predicted.


#### [Widespread Shocks in the Nucleus of NGC 404 Revealed by Near-infrared Integral Field Spectroscopy](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.03858)
    * Although NGC 404 is thought to host an intermediate mass black hole at its center, it has been unclear whether accretion onto the black hole or another mechanism such as shock excitation drives its LINER emission
    * The H2 gas is in a central rotating disk and ratios of multiple H2 lines indicate that the molecular gas is thermally excited, with some contribution from UV fluorescence.
    * The [FeII] emission is more extended and diffuse than the molecular gas and has a different kinematic structure that reaches higher velocities/dispersions.
    * Finally, we find regions across the nucleus of NGC 404 with [FeII]/Paβ line ratios up to 6.5, ∼2.5 times higher than the ratio measured from spatially-integrated spectra.

    * The (mbh/m∗)Qing associated with quenching is given by the ratio of the global black hole accretion rate density (BHARD) and star-formation rate density (SFRD) at the epoch in question.

    * The baryon contents in the hot ICM and stars of these clusters within r500 are lower than the values expected from the gravitational masses, according to the standard cosmology.
    * estimate column densities of the hot ICM along the sightlines toward the background QSOs as well as place upper limits on the warm-hot phase for the one sightline with existing UV observation


#### [Baryon-induced dark matter cores in the EAGLE simulations](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.04186)
    * star formation gas density threshold plays a critical role.
    * At low thresholds, baryons are unable to collapse to high enough density to dominate the gravitational potential before being dispersed by the energetic feedback of evolving stars. They therefore have little effect on the dark matter, even in systems with extended and bursty star formation 
    * At higher thresholds, baryons collapse to densities comparable to the dark matter before being suddenly ejected by feedback, reducing the central dark matter density.
    * Core formation requires that baryons collect at the centre over a relatively long period of time, as this allows the halo to contract before baryons are expelled, maximizing the effect. Core formation thus occurs in a small number of distinctive gas blowouts
    * Short fluctuations, such as those associated with bursty star formation, are ineffective at altering the dark matter inner profile.
   

#### [The ALMA Detection of Extraplanar 13CO in a Ram-pressure-stripped Galaxy and Its Implication](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.04188)
    * we report here the extraplanar 13CO detection that has never before been seen in ram- pressure-stripped galaxies. 
    * As the main donor of 13C in the interstellar medium is evolved stars, the presence of 13CO strongly suggests that heavy elements likely originated from the galactic disk, not from the newly formed stars in situ.
    * provides evidence for the ram pressure stripping of heavy elements, which can chemically enrich the halo gas, and potentially the intracluster medium, in the case that they are pushed strongly enough to escape the galaxy.


#### [Photoionization models for extreme Lyα λ1216 and HeII λ1640 ratios in quasar halos, and PopIII vs AGN diagnostics](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.04463)
    * explore potential mechanisms to produce extremely high Lyα/HeII flux ratios, or to enhance the observed number of Lyα photons per incident ionizing photon, in extended AGN-photoionized nebulae at high-redshift.
    * compute models to simulate, in the low density regime, photoionization of interstellar gas by the radiation field of a luminous AGN.
    * Low ionization parameter, a relatively soft or filtered ionizing spectrum, low gas metallicity, κ-distributed electron energies, or reflection of Lyα photons by neutral hydrogen can all result in significantly enhanced Lyα relative to other line
    * In the cases of low gas metallicity, reflection by HI, or a hard or filtered ionizing spectrum, the observed number of Lyα photons per incident ionizing photon is itself significantly enhanced above the nominal Case B value of 0.66 due to collisional excitation
    * We find that at low gas metallicity (e.g. Z/Z⊙=0.1) the production of Lyα photons is predominantly via collisional excitation rather than by recombination.
    * we find that the collisional excitation of Lyα becomes much more efficient if the ionizing continuum spectrum has been pre-filtered through an optically thin screen of gas closer to the AGN

#### [The Hot, Accreted Halo of NGC 891](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.04680)
    * We present a measurement of the metallicity around NGC 891, a nearby, edge-on, Milky Way analog. We find that the hot gas is dominated by low metallicity gas near the virial temperature at kT = 0.20 ± 0.01 keV and Z/Z⊙ = 0.14 ± 0.03
    * this gas co-exists with hotter (kT = 0.71 ± 0.04 keV) gas that is concentrated near the star-forming regions in the disk. 
    * The low metallicity gas is consistent with the inner part of an extended halo accreted from the intergalactic medium, which has been modulated by star formation.
    * There is much more cold gas than hot gas around NGC 891, which is difficult to explain in either the accretion or supernova-driven outflow scenarios.


#### [X-rays across the galaxy population - III. The incidence of AGN as a function of star formation rate](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.04683)

    * 对于Main sequence的SF星系：We find a linear correlation between the average SFR and both the AGN fraction and average specific accretion rate that accounts for much of the complex stellar-mass and redshift dependence of the incidence of AGN in star-forming galaxies
    * We find that the AGN fraction is significantly elevated for galaxies that are still star-forming but with SFRs below the main sequence, indicating an enhanced AGN triggering rate. 
    * The incidence of high-accretion-rate AGN is enhanced in starburst galaxies and evolves more mildly with redshift than within the rest of the galaxy population, suggesting mergers play a role in driving AGN activity in such high-SFR galaxies.

    * It is embedded in an even larger overdense region with at least 41 spectroscopically confirmed, luminous Lyα-emitting galaxies
    * Its LAE density is 6.6 times the average density at z ≈ 5.7. It is the only one of its kind in a LAE survey in four square degrees on the sky. 


#### [The UVES Spectral Quasar Absorption Database (SQUAD) Data Release 1: The first 10 million seconds](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.06136)
    * 467 fully reduced, continuum-fitted high-resolution quasar spectra from the Ultraviolet and Visual Echelle Spectrograph (UVES)
    * The SQUAD spectra are fully reproducible from the raw, archival UVES exposures with open-source software, including our uves_popler tool for combining multiple extracted echelle exposures which we document here 
    * We provide a catalogue of 155 DLAs whose Lyman-α lines are covered by the DR1 spectra, 18 of which are reported for the first time.


#### [Detection of 84-GHz class I methanol maser emission towards NGC 253](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.06179)
    * NGC 253 for the presence of 84.5 GHz (5−1 → 40E) methanol emission using the Australia Telescope Compact Array.
    * This maser emission is offset from dynamical centre of NGC 253, in a region with previously detected emission from class I maser transitions
    * The emission features a narrow linewidth (∼12 km s−1) with a luminosity approximately 5 orders of magnitude higher than typical Galactic sources. 
    * The three methanol maser transitions observed toward NGC 253 each show a different distribution, suggesting differing physical conditions between the maser sites


#### [Bipolar ionization cones in the Extended Narrow-Line Region of nearby QSO2s](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.06246)
    * 用HST窄带图像研究低红移Type-2 QSO：in order to constrain the geometry of their Extended Narrow-Line Regions (ENLR), as recent ground-based studies suggest these regions become more spherical at high luminosities due to destruction of the torus.
    * We find instead elongated ENLRs reaching 4 to 19 kpc from the nucleus and bipolar ionization cones in [OIII]/(Hα+[NII]) excitation maps indicating that the torus survives these luminosities
