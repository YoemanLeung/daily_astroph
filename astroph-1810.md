## Oct 2:

#### [The missing light of the Hubble Ultra Deep Field](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.00002)
    - **Relevant, Interesting**
    * We created ABYSS: a pipeline that optimises the estimate and modelling of low-level systematic effects to obtain a robust background subtraction.
    * The new mosaics successfully recover the low surface brightness structure removed on the previous HUDF published reductions.
    * The developed procedures are applicable to HST, JWST, EUCLID and many other space and ground-based observatories.


#### [Jellyfish galaxies with the IllustrisTNG simulations: I. Gas-stripping phenomena in the full cosmological context](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.00005)
    * Among more than about 6 000 (2 600) galaxies with stars (and some gas), we identify 800 jellyfish galaxies by visually inspecting their gas and stellar mass maps in random projections.
    * Namely, about 31 per cent of cluster satellites are found with signatures of ram-pressure stripping and gaseous tails stemming from their main luminous bodies 这还是lower limit
    * The frequency of jellyfish galaxies shows a very weak dependence on redshift (0 ≤ z ≤ 0.6) but larger fractions of disturbed gaseous morphologies occur in more massive hosts and at smaller satellite masses.


#### [MOSFIRE Spectroscopy of Quiescent Galaxies at 1.5 < z < 2.5. II - Star Formation Histories and Galaxy Quenching](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.00008)
    - **Relevant, Important**
    * After subtracting the stellar templates, the stacked spectrum reveals the Hα and [N II] emission lines, providing an upper limit on the ongoing star formation rate of 0.9 ± 0.1 M⊙/yr.
    * Finding a tight relation between the stellar age and the rest-frame U −V and V −J colors, with a scatter of only 0.13 dex.
    * We model the number density evolution and find evidence for two distinct quenching paths: a fast quenching that produces compact, spheroidal post-starburst systems residing in overdense regions; and a slow quenching of larger galaxies.


#### [The Relative Specific Type Ia Supernovae Rate From Three Years of ASAS-SN](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.00011)
    - **Important**
    * 476 SN Ia host: We find that the luminosity distribution of the SNe Ia in our sample is reasonably well described by a Schechter function with a faint-end slope α ≈ 1.5 and a knee M⋆ ≈ −18.0.
    * This shows that the specific SN Ia rate continues rising towards lower masses even in galaxies as small as log(M⋆/M⊙)~7.0
    * We find no strong dependence of the specific SN Ia rate on the star formation activity of the host galaxies


#### [Was the Milky Way a chain galaxy? Using the IGIMF theory to constrain the thin-disk star formation history and mass](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.00034)
    * Here, the shape of the PDMF for stars more massive than 1 M⊙ in combination with the mass density in low-mass stars is used to constrain the current star-formation rate (SFR), the star formation history (SFH) and the current stellar plus remnant mass (M∗) in the Galactic thin disk
    * The invariant canonical IMF can reproduce the PDMF of the Galaxy as well as the IGIMF, but in the universal IMF framework it is not possible to constrain any of the above Galactic properties.


#### [Changing-Look Quasar Candidates: First Results from Follow-up Spectroscopy](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.00087)
    * Our primary selection requires large-amplitude (|∆g| > 1 mag, |∆r| > 0.5 mag) variability over any of the available time baselines probed by the SDSS and Pan-STARRS 1 surveys.
    * For our adopted S/N threshold on variability of broad Hβ emission, we find 16 new CLQs, yielding a confirmation rate of 􏰑20%.
    * These candidates are at lower Eddington ratio relative to the overall quasar population and support a disk-wind model for the broad line region.


#### [Mildly Suppressed Star Formation in Central Regions of MaNGA Seyfert Galaxies](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.00365)
    * We present spatially-resolved Hα measurements to trace ongoing star formation in Seyfert galaxies
    * From the comparison we find that the star formation rates within central kpc of Seyfert galaxies are mildly suppressed as compared to the matched normal star forming galaxies. 


#### [Radio-loud AGN variability from three-dimensional propagating relativistic jets](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.00365)
    * We use the Athena hydrodynamics code to simulate an extensive suite of 54 propagating three-dimensional relativistic jets with wide ranges of input jet velocities and jet-to-ambient matter density ratios. 


#### [The rest-frame optical sizes of massive galaxies with suppressed star formation at z~4](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.00543)
    - **Interesting**
    * the rest-frame optical sizes of massive quiescent galaxies (QGs) at z ∼ 4 measured at K′-band with the Infrared Camera and Spectrograph (IRCS) and adaptive optics facility, AO188
    * Compared to lower redshift ones, QGs at z ∼ 4 have smaller physical sizes of effective radii reff = 0.2 to 1.7 kpc. The mean size measured by stacking the four brightest objects, a more robust measurement, is reff = 0.5 kpc.
    * Their size growth is proportional to the square of stellar mass, indicating the size-stellar mass growth driven by minor dry mergers.


#### [The Fornax Deep Survey (FDS) with the VST: V. A size and magnitude limited catalog of dwarf galaxies in the area of the Fornax cluster](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.00550)
    - **Relevant, Useful**
    * Our final catalog includes 14,095 galaxies. We classify 590 galaxies as being likely Fornax cluster galaxies, of which 564 are dwarfs (Mr′ > -18.5 mag) consisting our Fornax dwarf catalog.


#### [Stellar systems in the direction of Pegasus I - I. Low surface brightness galaxies](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.00710)
    - **Relevant**
    * eight of this type of objects (μeff,g′ ≃ 27 mag arcsec−2) towards the group of galaxies PegasusI. They are located, in projection, within a radius of ∼ 200 kpc in the very center of Pegasus I,
    * Assuming that these galaxies are at the distance of Pegasus I, we have found that their sizes are intermediate among similar objects reported in the literature. In particular, we found that three of these galaxies can be classified as ultra-diffuse galaxies and a fourth one displays a nucleus. 
    *  We also show that there seems to be a bias effect in the size distributions of the detected LSBs in different environments, in the sense that more distant groups/clusters lack small reff objects,


#### [Nearly all the sky is covered by Lyman-alpha emission around high redshift galaxies](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.00843)
    - **Important**
    * A new window into circumgalactic environments was recently opened with the discovery of ubiquitous extended Lyman-α emission from hydrogen around high-redshift galaxies, facilitated by the extraordinary sensitivity of the MUSE instrument at the ESO Very Large Telescope
    * Here we demonstrate that low surface brightness Lyman-α emission surrounding faint galaxies at redshifts between 3 and 6 adds up to a projected sky coverage of nearly 100%.


#### [nIFTy Galaxy Cluster simulations VI: The gaseous outskirts of galaxy cluster](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.00534)
    * 为什么cluster outskirt重要：marking the transition from the mildly non-linear cosmic web to the highly non-linear, virialised, cluster environment.
    * Our analysis reveals that the ICM in cluster outskirts is relatively insensitive to both choice of code and galaxy formation prescription. 
    * Spherically averaged gas density profiles follow the underlying dark matter, scaled by the cosmic baryon fraction, while temperature and velocity profiles show signatures of strong shocks, short-lived interior to the virial radius and longer-lived at larger radii.
    * Our results make clear that cluster outskirts are shaped by large-scale gravitational dynamics and strong, inefficiently radiating, shocks.


#### [The NuSTAR Extragalactic Surveys: unveiling rare, buried AGNs and detecting the contributors to the peak of the Cosmic X-ray Background](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.00010)
    * We report on the results of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) detection by NuSTAR performed in three extragalactic survey fields (COSMOS, UDS, ECDFS) in three hard bands
    * the H2 band (16-24 KeV) directly probing close to the peak of the Cosmic X-ray Background (CXB) returns four significant detections, and two tentative, although not significant, detections are found in the VH band
    * We compute the integral number counts for sources in such bands, which show broad consistency with population synthesis models of the CXB.
