### June 2

* [Photoevaporation of Jeans unstable clumps by FUV radiation](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.13230)
  * 外加的FUV辐射场很难完全阻止10-200Msun的分子气体团块的坍缩，但是可以控制最后用于形成恒星的气体质量
  * For example, for G0<104 more than 10% of the initial clump mass survives
  * 对于大质量的分子气体团块，H2质量在坍缩过程中还会增加。可能是在过程中因为H2 self-shielding形成的

* [Horizon-AGN virtual observatory - 2: Template-free estimates of galaxy properties from colours](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.13233)
  * 用SOM展示如何将模拟里复杂的数据压缩到2维：This direct mapping from colour to physical parameter space is shown to work also after including photometric uncertainties that mimic the COSMOS survey
  * 用模拟训练的样本来估计红移和SFR，精度都不差; We advocate that obtaining the calibration for this method should be one of the goals of next-generation galaxy surveys.

* [Predictions for the spatial distribution of the dust continuum emission in 1<z<5 star-forming galaxies](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.13234)
  * FIRE模拟的高红移Submm星系的SKIRT辐射转移再处理 (z=2的时候质量接近银河系)
  * 得到了高分辨的多波段“图像”，结构明显随波长变化，紫外波段clumpy的，在FIR波段可能像规则的旋涡星系
  * rest-frame 870 micron Re~0.5-4 kpc，和ALMA观测接近。
  * 尘埃连续谱的分布比冷气体和尘埃质量分布更紧密，比恒星分布更延展：极端的例子是，有致密的恒星形成导致了尘埃温度的很陡的梯度
  * 尘埃连续谱的分布取决于尘埃质量和恒星形成率

* [Ultra-diffuse galaxies without dark matter](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.13235)
  * **Interesting**
  * Joseph Silk用高速星系碰撞解释没有暗物质的UDG
  * Predictions include simultaneous triggering of overpressured dense clouds to form luminous old globular clusters, a protogroup environment to generate high relative velocities of the initially gas-rich galaxies in the early universe, and spatially separated dark halos

* [Enhanced cluster lensing models with measured galaxy kinematics](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.13236)
  * 用星系运动学数据做补充，做HFF大质量星系团更仔细的subhalo质量分布模型
  * MUSE观测的星系团中心，测量单个星系的速度弥散度，对每个星系团测量Faber-Jackson关系
  * 主要的改进在于降低了subhalo中心速度弥散度和truncation半径之间的简并
  * The three independent determinations of the σ0-rcut relation in each cluster are fully consistent, enabling a statistical determination of subhalo sizes at given σ0 or mass.

* [ALMA unveils widespread molecular gas clumps in the ram pressure stripped tail of the Norma jellyfish galaxy](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.13249)
  * ESO 137-001的ALMA CO(2-1)高分辨分子气体分布，研究RPS的作用
  * 在RPS产生的tail里探测到了 10^9 Msun的分子气体
  * The CO features are found predominantly at the heads of numerous small-scale (~ 1.5 kpc) fireballs but also of large-scale (~ 8 kpc) super-fireballs, and double-sided fireballs that have additional diffuse ionized gas tails extending in the direction opposite to the stellar tails
  * 能够从CO结构的指向上推测其起源：方向和弥散电离气体一致的更有可能是本地形成的，而呈一定角度的可能是从盘上被移除的

* [Effects of coplanar satellite bands on galactic disc evolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.13261)
  * 用模拟研究盘星系周围共面，同向旋转的矮星系对盘的影响：quasi-periodic alignments of multiple small satellites within the structure that emulate the gravitational influence of a single, larger satellite
  * 可以在很长的时标内在盘上连续地驱动密度波: 形成的“旋臂”是絮状且多臂的

* [The MOSDEF survey: a census of AGN-driven ionized outflows at z=1.4−3.8](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.13338)
  * 159个高红移AGN中的外流研究，包含了quiescent和SF的宿主星系
  * 17%的AGN中有能通过发射线看到的外流，比质量匹配的不活动星系样本的比例高; 比例和星系质量以及是否恒星形成关系不大; 在整个SF main-seq都可以看到AGN引起的外流
  * 外流速度较快，且空间分布尺度很大：with velocities of ∼400−3500 km s−1 and spatial extents of 0.3−11.0 kpc
  * The mass-loading factors of the outflows are typically 0.1−1 and increase with AGN luminosity 有些足以调节星系的SF

* [The Origin of the Stellar Mass-Stellar Metallicity Relation in the Milky Way Satellites and beyond](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.13374)
  * **Worth-reading**
  * 用化学演化模型去解释MZR的起源，以及为什么在很大的质量范围内关系都很好
  * 假定：冷气体质量以及恒星反馈强度都和恒星质量呈一定幂律关系: We use the SAM to obtain these power-law scaling relations, which appear to be roughly universal over a large range of stellar masses for both satellites and central galaxies within a large range of halo masses
  * MZR的出现和Universal特征和冷气体质量比例随质量下降，以及恒星反馈效率也随恒星质量下降有关

* [The whole picture of the large-scale structure of the CL1604 supercluster at z∼0.9](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.13437)
  * HSC观测的一个高红移大质量星系团周围的结构，Subaru+Gemini光谱后续观测，确定了55 red-sequence galaxies and 82 star-forming galaxies的红移： there are galaxy clusters at three slightly different redshifts in the northern and southern sides of the supercluster
  * 在50 Mpc的范围内，red星系的光谱和星族性质看上去很接近，都有一个> 2Gyr的老年成分: 形成时间接近？并快速聚集在一个过高密度的区域

* [Probing gaseous halos of galaxies with radio jets](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.13506)
  * **Interesting**
  * LOFAR LoTSS巡天发现，在10^11 Msun质量以上的星系中，射电光度随质量升高得非常快
  * 本文通过模型研究这个现象能不能用jet能量和黑洞质量，星系质量，以及halo气体密度之间的关系解释： We developed models for the radio luminosity of radio AGN in halos under infall, galactic wind and hydrostatic conditions based on observational data and theoretical constraints
  * We find that the maximum radio luminosities for the hydrostatic gas halos fit well with the upper envelope of the distribution of the LOFAR data.
  * 模型中，在10^11 Msun质量处的变化是halo气体密度的变化导致的

* [The faint end of the z∼6−7 Luminosity Function of Lyman-alpha emitters behind lensing clusters observed with MUSE](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.13696)
  * 4个星系团后用MUSE观测被放大的LAE，看Lya的LF: The price to pay to benefit from magnification is a reduction of the effective volume of the survey, together with a more complex analysis procedure.
  * 在2.9< z < 6.7的四个红移bin内没有看到显著的LF的红移演化
  * The contribution of the LAE population to the star formation rate density at z∼6 is ≲50% depending on the luminosity limit considered, which is of the same order as the Lyman-break galaxy (LBG) contribution.

### June 3

* [A Giant Intragroup Nebula Hosting a Damped Lya Absorber at z=0.313](https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.00005)
  * z=0.3的一个DLA周围的100kpc的巨大发射气体星云，DLA位于一个group里
  * [O II], Hβ, [O III], Hα, and [N II] 发射气体与星系群内星系的运动比较一致
  * The emission morphology, kinematics, and line ratios of the nebula suggest that shocks and turbulent mixing layers, produced as a result of stripped gaseous streams moving at supersonic speed across the ambient hot medium, contribute significantly to the ionization of the gas.
  * 星系群内星系损失的气体可以和有效的贡献金属增丰的气体

* [Star formation quenching imprinted on the internal structure of naked red nuggets](https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.00007)
  * **Relevant, Interesting**
  * 作者还是假设naked red nuggets基本全是in situ成分
  * 对12个这样的星系进行了IFU观测，研究SFH和星族性质的径向变化：这些星系在SF时变得越来越compact，在quenched时最compact；之后仍在可以在disc结构上有SF
  * Red nugget quenched的时刻可能和 M_SMBH/M_*有关

* [The Grism Lens-Amplified Survey from Space (GLASS). XIII. G800L optical spectra from the parallel fields](https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.00008)
  * GLASS平行场里面的22755个天体的无缝光谱，覆盖了220平方角分
  * The spectroscopic catalogue has a median redshift of ⟨z⟩ = 0.60 with a median uncertainty of ∆z/(1 + z)~2% at F814W <23 AB.
  * 处理软件是：Grism Redshift and Line Analysis tool (GRIZLI)

* [Discovery of four cold dusty galaxies at z=3.62-5.85 in the COSMOS field: direct evidence of CMB impact on high-redshift galaxy observables](https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.00040)
  * ALMA观测COSMOS场里的FIR挑选出来的高红移富尘埃SF星系：This includes the most distant dusty galaxy currently known in the COSMOS field, ID85001929 at z=5.847.
  * CMB plays a significant role biasing their observed Rayleigh-Jeans (RJ) slopes to unlikely steep values and, possibly, reducing their CO fluxes by a factor of two. 把CMB贡献扣除后，RJ端的slope就正常了
  * 这些星系的形态比较compact，而且有些有merger迹象，这是一族尘埃很冷的SF星系，在之前巡天中发现得不多；比相应红移上MS上的星系的尘埃都要冷
  * 可能意味着较低的恒星形成效率和较高的金属增丰效率；或者更可能的原因是FIR波段尘埃的不透明度高

* [The Mass Density Profile and Star Formation History of Gaussian and Non-Gaussian Clusters](https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.00060)
  * 看Yang etal中的近邻cluster里面的星系的运动学状态：速度分布是否是高斯的
  * There is a 61% excess of faint galaxies in NGs when contrasted with G groups, when integrating from 0.8 to 2.0R/R200
  * Star formation in faint spirals of NG groups is significantly different from their counterpart in the G groups. 团成员速度分布不是高斯的星系团有更高的富气体星系的infall rate

* [Supermassive Black Hole Demographics: Evading M−σ](https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.00064)
  * **Interesting, Worth-reading**
  * SMBH-星系共同演化的解析研究，着眼于对质量超过M-sigma关系预测的SMBH: these are likely to have descended from extremely compact `blue nugget' galaxies born at high redshift, whose very high velocity dispersions allowed the black holes to reach unusually large masses.
  * 随后的并和使得sigma降低，让这些星系成为了M-sigma关系的另类，过程中还可能损失大量本来可以用于形成恒星的气体，导致恒星质量偏低
  * 还“预测”了两类星系的存在：Low-mass dwarfs whose central black holes lie below the M−σ relation at low redshift, and galaxies consisting of very massive (≳10^11M⊙) black holes with extremely small stellar masses.

* [The early growth of supermassive black holes in cosmological hydrodynamic simulations with constrained Gaussian realizations](https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.00242)
  * BlueTides模拟中的高红移SMBH成长：Our re-simulations confirm that only with the lowest tidal field, high-density peaks in the initial conditions can induce the fastest BH growth required to explain the z > 6 quasars.
  * 成长过程对种子黑洞的质量不是很敏感，从5x10^3-5-10^5 Msun, 在z=6都可以成长到10^9 Msun的SMBH
  * The increased BH merger rate for low mass BH seeds provides an exciting prospect for discriminating BH formation mechanisms with the advent of multi-messenger astrophysics and next-generation GW facilities.

* [SDSS-IV MaNGA: Stellar Population Gradients Within Barred Galaxies](https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.00643)
  * characterise radial stellar age and metallicity gradients along the bar and outside the bar in 128 strongly barred galaxies.
  * 年龄和丰度梯度在棒区域变平；IFU观测结果不宜简单的用角向平均的性质
  * 也说明棒能在径向有效的混合恒星成分

* [CO observations of major merger pairs at z=0: Molecular gas mass and star formation](https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.00682)
  * 一批78个近邻并和星系对中的旋涡星系的CO观测，有各种形态组合；SFR和尘埃质量来自Herschel，HI来自GBT
  * 看并和中的旋涡星系的不同质量成分之间的关系，看H2对恒星质量以及HI质量的比例等如何随并和对中的形态组合和恒星质量变化。
  * 处于并和中的Spiral-Spiral对有分子气体比例和 H2/HI 比例的轻微增强，但是在SFE和总气体比例上似乎没有明显变化
  * For the molecular-to-atomic gas ratio MH2 /MHI, the difference between S+S and S+E subsamples is 0.69±0.16 dex and between pairs with and without interaction signs is 0.53±0.18 dex.
  * 相互作用星系中的SF增强主要是对于S+S对来说的，而且主要发生在第一次近密接触之后

* [The nature of faint radio galaxies at high redshifts](https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.00746)
  * HzRGS的候选，暗弱的射电源的光谱和近红外图像
  * 红移在 0.52 ≤ z ≤ 5.72, 射电光度比之前的巡天低一个量级左右
  * 和相同红移的明亮射电源比，这些星系的Lya光度更低，线宽更窄 --> AGN的电离作用更弱？恒星质量也更低
  * We find that faint HzRG population in the red- shift range 2 − 4 forms a bridge between star-forming and narrow-line AGN, whereas th ones at z > 4 are dominated by star-formation

* [Redshift Evolution of the Fundamental Plane Relation in the IllustrisTNG Simulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.00927)
  * **Interesting, Relevant, Worth-reading**
  * TNG中，在z=2就可以看到FP的迹象了：Its scatter stays as low as ∼ 0.08 dex across this redshift range.
  * FP的slopes从z=2开始只有轻度的演化
  * FP的residual主要和恒星年龄有关
  * 4c + b + 2 = δ, where δ ∼ 0.8 for FPs in TNG, rather than zero as is typically inferred from observations. 说明TNG中动力学质量和动力学质光比之间的关系不如观测中推测出的那样紧密
  * 而这个关系的出现需要非常好的暗物质和重子物质平衡的相互混合，也需要有恰到好处的SFE和反馈强度，对模型的限制能力很强
  * 使用类似CModel的方法区分早型和晚型星系的，看Dev和Exp轮廓哪个能更好的拟合。这个未必是最好的办法

* [Accurate Modeling of the Projected Galaxy Clustering in Photometric Surveys: I. Tests with Mock Catalogs](https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.00516)
  * **Relevant, Useful**
  * 用测光红移下的图像巡天给出的投影2PCF来研究星系-暗晕关系的方法：By assuming a Gaussian form of the photometric redshift errors, we are able to simultaneously constrain the halo occupation distribution (HOD) models and the effective photometric redshift uncertainties.
  * This method also works well even for galaxy samples with 10 per cent catastrophic photometric redshift errors.

  * 这样的气体供给可以在星系中心形成大质量的分子云和星团 --> SLSN PTF10tpz being located near the inner structure

* [ERQs are the BOSS of Quasar Samples: The Highest-Velocity [OIII] Quasar Outflows](https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.00980)
  * z=2-3处消光很强的一类QSO，被认为是处在 blow-out phase的罕见个体
  * median infrared luminosity ⟨log L(erg/s)⟩ ∼46.2的28个ERQs的红外光谱观测，发现了非常宽，高度蓝移的 [OIII] 发射线 -> 反映了很高速的外流: ERQs on average have [OIII] outflows velocities about 3 times larger than those of luminosity-matched blue quasar samples.
  * 宽[OIII]线外流主要和QSO的红颜色有关，和射电噪程度，QSO光度，以及Eddington ratio关系不是很紧密
  * 应该至少有3-5%的QSO光度转化成了外流的动能

* [Testing the blast-wave AGN feedback scenario in MCG-03-58-007](https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.00985)
  * ALMA观测一个近邻AGN，其中有非常快的X-ray外流 (UFO, 接近0.1光速)
  * 探测到了星系尺度上的CO辐射，大部分的CO光度位于盘上; 但扣除盘的贡献后，可以看到中心的4kpc上的剩余CO发射，可能来自低速的分子气体外流; 也有可能是一个致密的盘结构
  * 和X-ray的UFO对比，发现符合a momentum-driven blast-wave feedback模型的预测; 和ULIRGS中那种能量守恒的大规模分子气体外流不同

### June 4

* [KiDS-SQuaD II: Machine learning selection of bright extragalactic objects to search for new gravitationally lensed quasars](https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.01638)
  * 在KiDS DR4里用机器学习方法找强引力透镜放大的类星体
  * 算法：CatBoost, that was specifically trained with the aim of creating a sample of extragalactic sources as clean as possible from stars
    * https://github.com/catboost
  * KiDS Bright EXtraGalactic Objects catalogue (KiDSBEXGO), specifically created to find gravitational lenses. r < 22 mag的类星体和星系
  * From this catalog we selected ’Multiplets’: close pairs of quasars or galaxies surrounded by at
least one quasar, presenting the 12 most reliable gravitationally lensed quasar candidates

* [The mid-infrared and CO gas properties of an extreme star-forming FeLoBAL quasar](https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.01640)
  * CO观测，气体质量在7x10^10 Msun，偏离中心速度40km/s
  * 红外SED需要三个成分解释： active galactic nucleus (AGN) torus, an AGN polar dust component, and a starburst; 星暴占主导，恒星形成率 > 2000 Msun/yr
  * 没有发现AGN明显影响CO分子气体的证据，可能正在从星暴阶段向AGN阶段转换

* [Detection of the self-regulation of star formation in galaxy discs](https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.01641)
  * Performed stellar population analysis using MUSE optical spectra of the spiral galaxy NGC 628 and find that current maximum star formation in spatially resolved regions is regulated according to the level of star formation in the recent past. 基本就是把当前的SFR密度和过去的平均值进行比较
  * 构建了一个适用于局域SF的“bathtub"模型：resolved self-regulator model
  * Estimate the mass-loading factor, η=2.5±0.5, consistent with values predicted by galaxy formation models

* [Can tides disrupt cold dark matter subhaloes?](https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.01642)
  * N-body realisations of cold dark matter subhaloes with centrally-divergent density cusps form artificial constant-density cores on the scale of the resolution limit of the simulation

* [On The Effect of Environment on Line Emission from the Circumgalactic Medium](https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.01643)
  * **Interesting**
  * SDSS叠加光谱研究CGM中Halpha发射线强度随环境的变化：在距离大质量星系500 kpc范围内，以及在高密度环境中发射线强度都偏低
  * We interpret these observations as a direct signature of environmentally-caused strangulation
  * 给出了一个简单的模型：the CGM cool gas fraction within 50 kpc is significantly decreased for galaxies that lie within 700 kpc of a massive galaxy, with about 80% of the cool gas removed even when the galaxy is at a distance of 500 kpc from its massive parent

* [Two merging galaxy clusters with very hot shock fronts observed shortly before pericentric passage](https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.01708)
  * ICM因为merger被加热，在subcluster中间发现merger shock的证据
  * From the ICM analysis of temperature discontinuity, the Mach numbers were determined to be MG036=1.3 and MG292=1.5
  * Simulations suggest that both clusters are observed shortly before pericentric passage.
  * 都是两个M500c超过3x10^14 Msun的cluster在并合

* [Hubble Frontier Field Photometric Catalogues of Abell 370 and RXC J2248.7-4431: Multiwavelength photometry, photometric redshifts, and stellar properties](https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.01725)
  * ASTRODEEP pipeline处理HST+VLT+Spitzer图像
  * A brief analysis of z > 6 objects selected using drop-out method, as well as spectroscopically confirmed sources and multiple images in both clusters. 发现dropout探测的污染依然比较多：~30-45% level by dusty galaxies at lower redshifts
  * The powerful magnification provided by the HFF clusters allows us an exploration of the properties of galaxies with intrinsic stellar masses as low as M∗≳107M⊙ and intrinsic star formation rates SFRs∼0.1-1M⊙/yr at z > 6.

* [The evolution of the UV luminosity function of globular clusters in the E-MOSAICS simulations](https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.01755)
  * 科学背景是用HST观测高红移被透镜放大的星系中的明亮年轻GC：Due to the rapid fading of young stellar populations in the UV, most of the simulated galaxies do not host GCs bright enough to be individually identified in deep Hubble Space Telescope (HST) observation
  * The median age of the most UV-luminous GCs is < 10 Myr (assuming no extinction)
  * 而且这些UV亮的GC对星系整体UV光度的贡献不大
  * We predict that the number density of UV-bright proto-GCs (or cluster clumps) will peak between redshifts z = 1 − 3

* [The Evolution of the Interstellar Medium in Post-Starburst Galaxies](https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.01890)
  * **Interesting**
  * 58个PSB星系中的尘埃质量测量：尘埃质量和恒星质量的比值与星暴结束后的时间之间呈反相关，说明在1Gyr的时间内，尘埃被摧毁，抛出星系外，或者因为其他原因而无法被观测到。
  * 尘埃的消耗时标在 205 Myr; 和CO示踪的 MH2/M*消耗时标相似; 说明气体和尘埃受到同样过程的影响，并在1-2Gyr内变成和ETG相符合的
  * 利用尘埃calibrate H2质量，可以把PSB放到K-S关系上，在200-300Myr的时间上，PSB逐渐从K-S关系上向下演化，偏离，因为SFR下降得比H2气体更快
  * 作者认为还是AGN feedback最有可能产生这种气体和尘埃的变化

* [Formation of Blue-cored Dwarf Early-type Galaxies in a Cluster Environment: a Kinematical Perspective](https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.01902)
  * **Relevant**
  * GMOS观测Virgo中心和边缘处两个有Blue core的dEs
  * The occurrence of a KDC and zero rotation in the internal kinematics along with the central star formation support the scenario of gas-rich dwarf-dwarf mergers in the formation of these two dE(bc)s
  * 至少Virgo中有部分蓝核dE是在团外通过dwarf-dwarf并合形成的，然后落入cluster，被quenched掉

* [Galaxy simulation with the evolution of grain size distribution](https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.01917)
  * 在孤立的盘星系的模拟中考虑尘埃颗粒尺寸的演化：by sampling 32 grid points on the axis of the grain radius
    * 模拟是用 gadget3-osaka 进行的
  * The grain size distribution evolves from a large-grain-dominated (≳0.1 μm) phase to a small-grain production phase, eventually converging to a power-law-like grain size distribution similar to the so-called MRN distribution.
    * Mathis et al. 1977;
    * 文章里有关于尘埃成长的很好的介绍：吸积在开始很有效，因为小尘埃的面积-体积比高；在气态金属被用完后，聚团开始变得重要，最终形成一个power law分布
  * We find that the small-grain abundance is higher in the dense ISM in the early epoch (t <1 Gyr) because of efficient dust growth by accretion, while coagulation makes the small-grain abundance less enhanced in the dense ISM later
  * 重点是：尘埃颗粒大小分布随着年龄会有变化，尤其是在1Gyr左右，对于高红移星系的消光曲线有很大影响

* [The Absence of [CII] 158μm Emission in Spectroscopically-Confirmed Galaxies at z>8](https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.01937)
  * ALMA data for the two most distant, gravitationally-lensed and spectroscopically-confirmed galaxies, A2744\_YD4 at z=8.38 and MACS1149\_JD1 at z=9.11: 两个星系都有很强的 [OII] 88 micron探测
  * In both cases we provide stringent upper limits on the presence of [CII] 158μm
  * Our results highlight the importance of using several emission line diagnostics with ALMA to investigate the nature of the interstellar medium in early galaxies.

* [Pipe3D Stellar and Gaseous Velocity Dispersions for CALIFA Galaxies](https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.02100)
  * Four different dispersions are extracted from emission (ionized gas) or absorption (stellar) spectra, with two spatial apertures (5'' and 30'').
  * 同样推荐了"Virial velocity parameter": We consider revised velocity-based scaling relations using the virial velocity parameter S_K^2 = K V_rot^2 + sigma^2 constructed with each of our dispersions. Our search for the strongest linear correlation between S_K and i-band absolute magnitudes favors the common K ~ 0.5, though the range 0.3 - 0.8 is statistically acceptable.

* [Radiative Transfer Distortions of Lyman-α Emitters: a New Fingers-of-God Damping in the Clustering in Redshift Space](https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.02173)
  * 用LAE研究大尺度结构受到Lya光子的复杂辐射转移机制的影响：RT induces a selection effect which results in an anisotropic distortion even in real space but in an otherwise negligible effect in redshift space.
  * 用模拟看RT对LAE在红移空间的成团性的影响: 观测中是通过Lya线的peak来定红移，所以RT会对红移空间的位置产生影响
  * 这种效应在径向方向上抑制了LAE的成团信号，可以看做是一种FoG效应
  * Although our findings strongly encourage a more careful RSD modeling in LAE surveys, we also seek a method to mitigate the additional FoG effect due to RT by making use of other information in a Lyman-α spectrum.

* [BlueMUSE: Project Overview and Science Cases](https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.01657)
  * **Interesting**
  * BlueMUSE, a blue-optimised, medium spectral resolution, panoramic integral field spectrograph based on the MUSE concept
  * With an optimised transmission down to 350 nm, a larger FoV (1.4 x 1.4 arcmin2) and a higher spectral resolution compared to MUSE
  * Deep field observations with BlueMUSE will also significantly increase samples of Lyman-alpha emitters, spanning the era of Cosmic Noon.
  * By 2030, at a time when the focus of most of the new large facilities (ELT, JWST) will be on the infra-red, BlueMUSE will be a unique facility, outperforming any ELT instrument in the Blue/UV.

* [Brighter-fatter effect in near-infrared detectors -- I. Theory of flat auto-correlations](https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.01846)
  * **Useful**
  * 对WFIRST上的Teledyne H4RG-10 detector arrays的Brighter-Fatter效应的讨论: in which charge already accumulated in a pixel alters the electric field geometry and causes new charge to be deflected away from brighter pixels.
  * Here we describe the formalism for measuring the BFE using flat field correlation functions in infrared detector arrays.
  * 光学CCD都是通过平场的自相关函数来测量BFE：because the infrared detector arrays are read out with the charge "in place," the flat field correlations are dominated by capacitive cross-talk between neighboring pixels (the inter-pixel capacitance, or IPC).
  * Because the infrared detector arrays can be read out non-destructively, one can compute numerous cross-correlation functions between different time slices of the same flat exposures, and that correlations due to IPC and BFE leave distinct imprints.

* [Brighter-fatter effect in near-infrared detectors -- II. Auto-correlation analysis of H4RG-10 flats](https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.01847)
  * **Useful**
  * WFIRST will use hybrid complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) detector arrays, which must be fully characterized to inform data reduction and calibration procedures such that unbiased cosmological results can be achieved
  * We find a residual correlation signal after accounting for classical non-linearity. This residual correlation contains a combination of the BFE and NL-IPC 但BFE占主导
  * This work presents the first evidence for the BFE in an H4RG-10 detector, demonstrates some of the useful insights that can be gleaned from flat field statistics, and represents a significant step towards calibration of WFIRST data.

  * Due to the non-linear Poisson equation in MOND, a dwarf galaxy has weaker self-gravity when in close proximity to a massive host. This external field effect is investigated using a new analytic formulation and fully self-consistent live N-body models in MOND.
  * The correctly calculated MOND velocity dispersion agrees with our inferred dispersion and that of van Dokkum et al. (2018b) if DF2 is within 150 kpc of NGC 1052 and both are 20 Mpc away. The GCs of DF2 are however significantly brighter and larger than normal GCs, a problem which disappears if DF2 is significantly closer to us.

* [Revisiting constraints on asteroid-mass primordial black holes as dark matter candidates](https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.05950)
  * 光学微引力透镜限制：We argue that it will be difficult to push the existing optical microlensing constraints to much lower mPBH
  * For dynamical capture of PBHs in stars, we derive a general result on the capture rate based on phase space arguments
  * For destruction of white dwarfs by PBHs that pass through the white dwarf without getting gravitationally captured, but which produce a shock that ignites carbon fusion
  * We find that the asteroid-mass window remains open for PBHs to account for all the dark matter.

* [Cosmological constraints from cosmic shear two-point correlation functions with HSC survey first-year data](https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.06041)
  * **Important**
  * Cosmic shear two-point correlation functions (TPCFs)
  * We adopt the standard TPCF estimators, ξ±, for our cosmological analysis, given that we find no evidence of the significant B-mode shear.
  * We carefully check the robustness of the cosmological results against astrophysical modeling uncertainties and systematic uncertainties in measurements, and find that none of them has a significant impact on the cosmological constraints.

* [One simulation to have them all: performance of the Bias Assignment Method against N-body simulations](https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.06109)
  * 更高效的生成对宇宙学有意义的mock catalog的方法
  * Bias Assignment Method (BAM, Balaguera-Antol´ınez et al. 2019) to extract the local and non-local bias linking the halo to the dark matter distribution
    * The method exploits the idea of mapping the halo distribution onto an approximated dark matter density field (A-DMDF hereafter), based on measurements of the halo-bias
  * We use an approximate (and fast) gravity solver to generate 300 dark matter density fields from the downsampled initial conditions of the reference simulation and sample each of these fields using the halo-bias and a kernel
  * We show that the power spectrum, its variance and the three-point statistics are reproduced within ∼2%

* [A giant Lyα nebula and a small-scale clumpy outflow in the system of the exotic quasar J0952+0114 unveiled by MUSE](https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.06347)
  * z=3.02; Lya窄线发射，金属线有宽线，可能是近邻的DLA造成的
  * MUSE观测揭示了一个100 pkpc的发射线星云。PDLA in J0952+0144 is covering only a small fraction of the QSO emission solid angle. 因为PDLA挡住了中心的QSO，才可以一直到中心都看到窄Lya弥散辐射
  * We also detected bright and spectrally narrow C IV λ1550 and He II λ1640 extended emission around J0952+0114 with velocity centroids similar to the peak of the extended and central narrow Lyα emission
  * The smaller velocity dispersion of the large scale Lyα emission suggests that the high-speed outflow is confined to the central region.

* [Constraints on Black Hole Jet Models Used As Diagnostic Tools of Event Horizon Telescope Observations of M87](https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.06353)
  * Recent 86 GHz Very Long Baseline Interferometry observations of M87 have revealed the morphology and size of the jet near its source 关于Jet形成的模型应该能解释这个特征。但是能解释宏观jet结构的模拟往往在中心区域太窄
  * 而且中心的jet是被edge的辐射主导的；Furthermore, the synthetic radio images are not edge dominated 0.06 - 0.32 lt-yrs from the source, but spine dominated.

* [Covariance-regularized reconstruction of data cubes in integral field spectroscopy and application to MaNGA data](https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.06369)
  * **Useful**
  * 基本就是 Bolton et al. 2010的 spectroperfectionism的IFU实现
  * IFU处理的第一步就是resample grid到一个正规的grid上：Most subsequent analysis procedures require a regular, wavelength independent sampling (for example a fixed rectangular grid)
  * 很难得到pixel之间相关性弱的sampling：A standard method in the field to produce a regular set of samples from an irregular set of samples is Shepard's method, but Shepard's method typically yields images with a degraded resolution and large statistical correlations between pixels.
  * 本文给出了一个FWHM和仪器本征分辨率更接近，比Shepard方法好16%，且low statistical correlations between pixels的新方法

* [ALMA view of the 12C/13C isotopic ratio in starburst galaxies](https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.06638)
  * 利用ALMA的CN线观测: We derive molecular-gas-phase 12C/13C isotope ratios for the central few 100 pc of the three nearby starburst galaxies NGC 253, NGC 1068, and NGC 494
  * The highest 12C/13C isotopic ratios are determined in some of the outskirts of the nuclear regions of the three starburst galaxies.
  * Low 12C/13C isotopic ratios in the central regions of these starburst galaxies indicate the presence of highly processed material.
  * 应该记住12C和13C同位素丰度比的意义：12C and 18O are produced on rapid timescales primarily via He burning in massive stars. 13C and 17O are predominantly synthesized via CNO processing of 12C and 16O seeds from earlier stellar generations. The latter occurs on a slower time scale during the red giant phase in low and intermediate mass stars or novae
    * It is believed to be a direct measure of primary to secondary nuclear processing; 随着13C累积，比值应该会下降

* [Spatially Resolved Interstellar Medium and Highly-Excited Dense Molecular Gas in the Most Luminous Quasar at z=6.327](https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.06801)
  * 多频段ALMA观测号称有10^10 Msun SMBH的高红移类星体 J0100+2802
  * The galaxy size is measured to be Rmajor=3.6±0.2 kpc from the high resolution continuum observations.
  * No ordered motion on kilo-parsec scales was found in both [CII] and CO(6-5) emissions; we found that the CO emission is more concentrate (a factor of 1.8±0.4) than the [CII] emission.
  * 气体的速度弥散度比local M-sigma关系预测的低很多
  * CO SLED可以用一个cold+一个warm成分解释；尘埃连续谱的灰体拟合给出了高尘埃发射率或者热尘埃温度的证据

* [A nuclear molecular outflow in the Seyfert galaxy NGC3227](https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.06889)
  * ALMA的CO观测：On large scales the cold molecular gas shows circular motions as well as streaming motions on scales of a few hundred parsecs associated with a large scale bar.
  * The molecular gas in the central region (1" ~73pc) shows several CO clumps with complex kinematics which appears to be dominated by non-circular motions.
  * Assuming that the radial motions are in the plane of the galaxy, then we interpret them as a nuclear molecular outflow due to molecular gas in the host galaxy being entrained by the AGN wind.

* [NIHAO XXII: Introducing black hole formation, accretion and feedback into the NIHAO simulation suite](https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.06955)
  * **Relevant**
  * NIHAO模拟中加入黑洞物理，扩展到更高的halo质量：Now NIHAO contains 144 different galaxies and thus has the largest sample of zoom-in simulations of galaxies, spanning z=0 halo masses from 9×108 to 4×10^13M⊙.
  * For our fiducial choice of parameters we successfully quench star formation in objects above a z=0 halo mass of 10^12M⊙, thus transforming them into red and dead galaxies

* [The Near and Mid-infrared photometric properties of known redshift z≥5 Quasars](https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.06974)
  * A catalogue of 463 spectroscopically confirmed very high (z≥5.00) redshift quasars
  * 97% of the VHzQ sample is detected in one or more NIR (ZYJHK/Ks) band, with lack of coverage rather than lack of depth being the reason for the non-detections. 362 (78%) of the very high redshift quasars are detected at 3.4μm in the W1 band from the unWISE catalog and all of the z≥7 quasars are detected in both unWISE W1 and W2.
  * 高红移类星体可能的超爱丁顿吸积应该可以有光变探测：We find 32 of the quasars have sufficient NIR measurements and signal-to-noise to look for variability. Weak variability was detected in multiple bands of SDSS J0959+0227, and very marginally in the Y-band of MMT J0215-0529.

* [The star formation history of the Sculptor dwarf spheroidal galaxy](https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.07042)
  * DECam CMD研究Sculptor的SFH如何随位置变化：所有区域都是单次恒星形成, 中心区域的持续时间更长
  * 年龄由内向外增长：These results suggest that Sculptor continued forming stars after the reionization epoch in its central part, while in the peripheral region the majority of stars probably formed during the reionization epoch and soon after its end.

* [HI Spectroscopy of Reverberation-Mapped Active Galactic Nuclei](https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.07062)
  * Combining MGAS with constraints on MSTARS allows exploration of the baryonic content of these galaxies. We find a typical MGAS/MSTARS fraction of 10%, with a few reaching ∼30-50%.
  * We find a weak preference for galaxies with larger MGAS to host more massive black holes.
  * We also find gas-to-stellar fractions to weakly correlate with later types in unbarred spirals, with an approximately constant fraction for barred spirals.
  * Finally, we find a clear relationship for MBH-MBARY with a similar slope as MBH-MSTARS reported by Bentz & Manne-Nicholas (2018).

* [An interpretable machine learning framework for dark matter halo formation](https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.06339)
  * We investigate the impact of the initial density and tidal shear fields on the formation of haloes over the mass range 11.4≤log(M/M⊙)≤13.4. 用N-body模拟来训练, "initial conditions-to-halo mass mapping"
  * 机器学习算法训练从density contrast in the particles’ local environment预测final halo mass
  * 加入tidal shear信息并不能改进预测：This implies that our machine learning setup does not identify any significant role for the tidal shear in determining halo masses.

* [Cosmology with Stacked Cluster Weak Lensing and Cluster-Galaxy Cross-Correlations](https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.06499)
  * **Relevant, Interesting**
  * We show that combining the cluster weak lensing observable ΔΣ with the projected cluster-galaxy cross-correlation function wp,cg and galaxy auto-correlation function wp,gg can break the degeneracy between σ8 and σlnMc to achieve tight, percent-level constraints on σ8.
  * The small scale (rp<3.0h−1Mpc) "mass function" and large scale (rp>3.0h−1Mpc) "halo-mass cross-correlation" regimes of ΔΣ have comparable constraining power, allowing internal consistency tests from such an analysis.

* [Excursion Set Halos -- ExSHalos: A New Parameter Free Method for Fast Generation of Halo Catalogues](https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.06630)
  * 快速生成DM catalog的方法: This method requires as inputs only the linear matter power spectrum and the threshold density for halo formation in linear theory.
  * It directly uses excursion set ideas and Lagrangian perturbation theory to produce halo catalogues with the correct abundance, large scale power spectrum, bispectrum and velocity field.

* [Constraining dark matter annihilation with HSC Low Surface Brightness Galaxies](https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.06701)
  * We report on an analysis that uses eight LSBGs (detected by Subaru Hyper Suprime-Cam survey data) with known redshifts to conduct a search for gamma-ray emission at the positions of these new objects in Fermi Large Area Telescope data.
  * We found no excesses of gamma-ray emission and set constraints on the dark matter annihilation cross-section.
  * 未来LSB星系样本大了会很有帮助：We forecast conservatively that using the full catalog of soon-to-be-detected LSBGs will allow us to exclude the canonical thermal relic cross-section for dark matter particles with masses up to several tens of GeV.

* [Expanding the sample of radio minihalos in galaxy clusters](https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.07087)
  * We use GMRT and VLA data to expand the sample of minihalos by reporting three new minihalo detections (A 2667, A 907 and PSZ1 G139.61+24.20) and confirming minihalos in five clusters (MACS J0159.8-0849, MACS J0329.6-0211, RXC J2129.6+0005, AS 780 and A 3444).
  * We find no strong relation between the minihalo radio luminosity and the total cluster mass.
  * We find a strong positive correlation between the minihalo radio power and X-ray bolometric luminosity of the cool core (r<70 kpc). 可能几乎所有的Cool core cluster里都含有mini-halo; 可能是被气体sloshing产生的湍动引起的电子再加速产生的。
