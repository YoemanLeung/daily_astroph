    * Herschel ⋆ Reference Survey (HRS)
    * Our statistical analysis allows us to characterise the HRS, that, although non homogeneously selected and partially biased towards low IR luminosities, may be considered as representative of the local LT galaxy population.


#### [Evidence for the existence of abundant intracluster light at z= 1.24](https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.02687)
    - **Relevant**
    * We report measurements of the spatial distribution, color, and quantity of diffuse intracluster stars for a massive galaxy cluster at a redshift of 1.24.
    * Our detection of the significant ICL fraction in this unprecedentedly high redshift regime strongly indicates that intracluster stars, contrary to most previous studies, might have formed during a short period and early in the history of the Virgo-like massive cluster formation and might be concurrent with the formation of the brightest cluster galaxy.

#### [The complex jet- and bar-perturbed kinematics in NGC 3393 as revealed with ALMA and GEMINI-GMOS/IFU](https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.02756)
    * NGC 3393, a nearby Seyfert 2 galaxy with nuclear radio jets, large-scale and nuclear bars, and a posited secondary super massive black hole, provides an interesting laboratory to test the physics of inflows and outflows.
    * 电离气体有三个主要成分：
        - A narrow (σ < 115 km/s) component present in the complete FOV, which is consistent with rotation in the galaxy disk. 
        - A broad (σ > 115 km/s) redshifted component, detected near the NE and SW radio lobes; which we interpret as a radio jet driven outflow. 
        - And a broad (σ > 115 km/s) blueshifted component that shows high velocities in a region perpendicular to the radio jet axis; we interpret this as an equatorial outflow.
    * The highly disturbed kinematics of the inner region can be explained by perturbations induced by the nuclear bar and interactions with the large scale bar.

    * The correlation between the star forming sites and electron density ceases for targets with an outflow. The density within the outflowing medium is not uniform and shows both low and high density sites


#### [Morphology and kinematics of orbital components in CALIFA galaxies across the Hubble sequence](https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.02886)
    - **Important**
    * The correlation between the star forming sites and electron density ceases for targets with an outflow. The density within the outflowing medium is not uniform and shows both low and high density sites
    * We find that: (1) kinematic hotter components are generally more concentrated and rounder than colder components, and (2) all components become more concentrated and thicker/rounder in more massive galaxies;
    * Sersic n is not a good discriminator between rotating bulges and non-rotating bulges.
    * Cold和Hot比例和bulge还有disk成分有很好的相关
    * The warm orbits mainly contribute to disks in low-mass late-type galaxies, and to bulges in high-mass early-type galaxies.

    * SED拟合532个Post SB星系：In addition to an old stellar population and a recent starburst, 48% of the galaxies are best fit with a second recent burst.
    * 低质量星系更容易经历第二次星暴：the fraction of their young stellar mass is more strongly anti-correlated with their total stellar mass.
    * We discover a significant (4σ) decline, with a 117-230 Myr characteristic depletion time, in the molecular gas to stellar mass fraction with the post-burst age. 作者认为这个不是SF，也不是SN Feedback可以解释的，可能是AGN?


#### [Widespread star formation inside galactic outflows](https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.03301)
    * MaNGA: We find that star formation occurs inside at least half of the galactic outflows in our sample; 但因为AGN和Shock，不容易通过发射线诊断出来
    * Star formation in outflows can also potentially contribute to establishing the scaling relations between black holes and their host spheroids.  
    * 外流里的SN feedback可以对CGM和IGM产生化学增丰；young stars ejected on large orbits may also contribute to the reionization of the Universe.

    * The emission-line flux distributions reveal a ring of star forming regions with radius of 786 pc centred at the nucleus of the galaxy
    * The emission-line ratios and radio emission suggest that the gas at the nuclear region is excited by both starburst activity and an active galactic nucleus.

    * The presented quasar catalog comprises a total of 270 objects, of which 39 are newly identified in this work with spectroscopy 
    * A first analysis of the QLF suggests a relatively steep bright end slope of β ≈ −4 for this sample. This result contrasts with previous results in the same redshift range, which find a much flatter slope around β ∼ −2.5,

    * favor recent torus spectral models that properly treat the different sublimation temperatures of silicates and graphite and consider a polar wind component.
    * The torus luminosity correlates well with the strength of the ultraviolet/optical continuum and the broad Hβ emission line
    * The half-opening angle of the torus, a measure of its covering factor, declines with increasing accretion rate until the Eddington ratio reaches ∼ 0.5, above which the trend reverses.

    * This [O iii] detection confirms the LBG with a spectroscopic redshift of z = 8.3118 ± 0.0003
    * The ultraviolet-to-far IR spectral energy distribution modeling where the [O iii] emissivity model is incorporated suggests the presence of a moderately-evolved stellar component with the stellar mass of Mstar = 5 × 10^9M⊙

#### [Evidence of Environmental Quenching at Redshift z ~ 2](https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.04142)

    * Environment quenching: is observed as strong clustering of quiescent galaxies around quiescent galaxies on angular scales θ ≤ 20 arcsec, corresponding to a proper(comoving) scale of 168 (502) kpc at z = 2.
        - 只对quiescent周围的quiescent有类似的效应
    * The effect is mass dependent in the sense that the quenching probability is stronger for galaxies of smaller mass (M∗ < 10^10M⊙) than for more massive ones
    * The spatial scale where the effect is observed suggests these environments are massive halos, in which case the observed effect would likely be satellite quenching
    * 还有红移依赖，z=1.6比z=2.6要强; satellite quenching时标: 1.5-4.0 Gyr

    * 超高分辨率的ELVIS-on-FIRE: predict the existence of ∼ 3 unidentified galaxies with M∗ ∼ 10^5 M⊙ within 300 kpc of the MW. 
    * 没有TBTF和missing satellite问题: Among the satellites, TBTF is resolved primarily by subhalo disruption and overall mass loss; central density profiles of subhalos are of secondary importance.

#### [Optically faint massive Balmer Break Galaxies at z>3 in the CANDELS/GOODS fields](https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.04152)
    * A sample of 33 Balmer Break Galaxies (BBGs) selected as dropouts in the deepest HST/F160W images of the two CANDELS/GOODS fields
    * Finally, our results point out that one of every ten massive log(M/M⊙) > 11 galaxies in the local Universe was assembled in the first 1.5 Gyr after the Big Bang.


#### [What drives the evolution of gas kinematics in star-forming galaxies?](https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.04233)
    * 用FIRE模拟看为什么盘星系的气体速度弥散度在高红移更高
    * In both the observed and simulated galaxies, σintr is positively correlated with SFR. σintr increases with redshift out to z ∼ 1 and then flattens beyond that
    * we show that increased gas inflow leads to subsequent enhanced star formation, and enhancements in σintr tend to temporally coincide with increases mass inflow rates and SFR.


#### [MUSE crowded field 3D spectroscopy in NGC300 I. First results from central fields](https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.04280)
    - **Interesting**
    * (1) PSF-fitting 3D spectroscopy with PampelMUSE, as already successfully pioneered in globular clusters, yields deblended spectra of individually distinguishable stars, thus providing a complete inventory of blue/red supergiants, and AGB stars of type M and C. 还有有发射线的行星状星云

#### [Nuclear starburst activity induced by elongated bulges in spiral galaxies](https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.04353)
    * We find a statistically significant correlation between bulge elongation and nuclear starbursts in the sense that the fraction of nuclear starbursts increases with bulge elongation. 
    * These results suggest that non-axisymmetric bulges can efficiently feed the gas into the centre of galaxies to trigger nuclear starburst activity.


#### [A complete disclosure of the hidden type-1 AGN in NGC 1068 thanks to 52 years of broadband polarimetric observation](https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.04415)
    * first broadband polarization spectrum of an active galactic nucleus (AGN) by compiling the 0.1 – 100 μm, 4.9 GHz and 15 GHz continuum polarization of NGC 1068 from more than 50 years of observations.
    * The impact of the Big Blue bump and infrared bump, together with electron, Mie scattering, dichroism and synchrotron emission are naturally highlighted in polarization, allowing us to reveal the type-1 AGN core inside this type-2 object with unprecedented precision
    * in the case of NGC 1068, Thomson scattering is the dominant mechanism for the polarization in the optical band.


#### [The oxygen abundance gradients in the gas discs of galaxies in the EAGLE simulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.04575)
    * The estimated median oxygen gradient is −0.011±0.002 dex kpc−1, which is shallower than observed
    * However, the oxygen gradient shows a clear correlation with gas disc size so that shallower abundance slopes are found for increasing gas disc sizes.
    * Positive oxygen gradients are detected for ≈ 40 per cent of the analysed gas discs, with a slight higher frequency in low mass galaxies.

#### [The Clusters Hiding in Plain Sight (CHiPS) survey: A first discovery of a massive nearby cluster around PKS1353-341](https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.05676)
    * Discover new, nearby, and massive galaxy clusters that were incorrectly identified as isolated point
sources in the ROSAT All-Sky Survey.
    * The presence of a relaxed X-ray morphology, a central temperature drop, and a central cooling time around 400 Myr points to it being a strong cool-core cluster.
    * We see weak evidence of localized excess entropy at a radius of 200 kpc which, if real, could imply a recent (∼180 Myr) energetic outburst in the core that has risen buoyantly to a larger radius
    * 如果不是中心点源太亮，应该是可以被认证为cluster的，可能要在未来的X-ray巡天里考虑这个
    - There are only four known examples of galaxy clusters hosting central quasars: H1821+643 (Russell et al. 2010), 3C 186 (Siemiginowska et al. 2005, 2010), IRAS 09104+4109 (O’Sullivan et al. 2012), and the Phoenix cluster (McDonald et al. 2012).

    * For supersonic streams, the instability grows much faster in 3D and it can be qualitatively different due to 3D azimuthal modes
    * Contrary to the 2D estimates, we find that in 3D the KHI can lead to significant stream deceleration and energy dissipation.

#### [The Carnegie-Irvine Galaxy Survey. VII. Constraints on the Origin of S0 Galaxies from Their Photometric Structure](https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.06350)
    - **Gao Hua**
    * Many S0s do not host prominent bulges. S0 galaxies have a broad distribution of bulge-to-total ratios (B/T ) and S ́ersic indices (n), with average values of B/T = 0.34 ± 0.15 and n = 2.62 ± 1.02, qualitatively consistent with the notion that S0s define a parallel sequence with and may have evolved from spiral galaxies.
    * bulges of S0s form a surprisingly uniform sequence on both the Kormendy and fundamental plane relations
    * Most of the S0s reside in the field and in groups; cluster environment is not a necessary condition for S0 production.

    * there are variation-coupling effects in the transfer functions, arising from the coupling of CB-SMBH light curves in the Fourier space.
    * In order to search for CB- SMBHs in time-domain space, selection of target candidates should focus on local AGNs with Hβ double-peaked profiles and weaker near-infrared emission.
