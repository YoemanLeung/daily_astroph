* [Measuring Star-Formation Histories, Distances, and Metallicities with Pixel Color-Magnitude Diagrams I: Model Definition and Mock Tests](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.00011)
  * **Interesting, Useful**
  * Here we present Pixel Color-Magnitude Diagrams with Python (pcmdpy), a GPU-accelerated package that makes significant computational improvements to the original code and including more realistic physical models.
  * These advances include the simultaneous fitting of distance, modeling a Gaussian metallicity-distribution function, and an observationally-motivated dust model.
  * Our results suggest the code, applied to observations with HST-like resolution, should constrain these properties with high precision within 10 Mpc and can be applied to systems out to as far as 100 Mpc.

* [The evolution of the quenching of star formation in cluster galaxies since z ∼ 1](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.00011)
  * **Relevant**
  * 看HSC数据中209 IR-selected galaxy clusters at 0.3≤z≤1.1 in the ELAIS-N1 and XMM-LSS fields的恒星形成星系
  * Using R/R200 to trace environment, we observe a decrease in fSF from the field towards the cluster core, which strongly depends on stellar mass and redshift.
  * Finally, we find that environmental and mass quenching efficiencies depend on galaxy stellar mass and distance to the center of the cluster, demonstrating that the two effects are not separable in the cluster environment.

* [Major mergers are not the dominant trigger for high-accretion AGNs at z = 2](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.00037)
  * We examine 21 galaxies hosting a high accreting black hole (L/Ledd > 0.7) observed with HST/WFC3 and 92 stellar mass- and redshift- matched inactive galaxies taken from the CANDELS survey.
  * 把AGN贡献扣除后，打乱再分类：The resulting samples were joined, randomized, and subsequently visually ranked with respect to perceived strength of structural distortions by 10 experts.
  * With the merger fractions fm,agn = 0.24 ± 0.09 for the AGN host galaxy sample and fm,ina = 0.19 ± 0.04 for the inactive galaxies, we find no significant difference between the AGN host galaxies and inactive galaxies

* [The Extended Disk Galaxy Exploration Science Survey: Description and Surface Brightness Profile Properties](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.00050)
  * **Relevant, Interesting**
  * EDGES is a Spitzer Space Telescope Warm Mission program designed to reach the surface brightness limit (∼0.5 kJy sr−1 or 29 AB mag arcsec−2) of the Infrared Array Camera (IRAC) 3.6 and 4.5 μm bands for a wide range of galaxy types found within the local volume.
  * The surface brightness profiles exhibit a large range in disc scalelength, with breaks more frequently seen than in previous studies, owing in large part to the extremely deep near-infrared imaging.
  * A number of these surface brightness profile breaks may be due to stellar halos, up to 7 galaxies out of the full sample of 92 galaxies

* [The molecular-gas properties in the gravitationally lensed merger HATLAS J142935.3-002836](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.00307)
  * New APEX observations targeting two carbon monoxide (CO) rotational transitions J_up=3 and 6.
  * We show that the line-profiles comprise three distinct velocity components, where the fainter high-velocity one is less magnified and more compact.
  * The detected gas and dust emission comes exclusively from only one of the two merging components

* [Giant radio galaxies in the LOFAR Two-metre Sky Survey-I](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.00409)
  * **Interesting**
  * GRGs are much rarer than normal sized radio galaxies ( less than 0.7 Mpc) and the reason for their gigantic sizes is still debated
  * 本文展示了从LFAR LoTSS中得到的最大的巨射电星系样本： Of the 240 GRGs found, 228 are new discoveries. The GRGs have sizes ranging from 0.7 to 3.5 Mpc and have redshifts between 0.1 and 2.3. Seven GRGs have sizes above 2 Mpc and one has a size of ~ 3.5 Mpc.
  * We also find that 21 GRGs are located in dense galaxy cluster/group environments, which were identified using optical data.
  * 射电谱指数和普通的射点星系差别不大

* [The time delay between star formation quenching and morphological transformation of galaxies in clusters: a phase-space view of EDisCS](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.00466)
  * Explore the possible effect of cluster environments on the structure and star formation histories of galaxies by analysing the projected phase-space (PPS) of intermediate-redshift cluster (0.4<z<0.8).
  * we establish that in all environments younger star-forming galaxies of all morphologies are 'rougher' (REF高) and more asymmetric than older, more quiescent ones.
  * Find a significant correlation between the position of the galaxies on the PPS and their stellar ages, irrespective of their morphology.
    * These results may imply that, transformation happens on a longer timescale as they accumulate and age in the cluster cores.

* [Galaxies and Supermassive Black Holes at z <= 0.1: The Velocity Dispersion Function](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.00486)
  * **Important, Relevant**
  * SDSS星系的VDF研究：We compare two different sigma estimates; one based on SDSS spectroscopy (sigma_spec) and another on photometric estimates (sigma_mod).
  * The VDFs measured from these quantities are remarkably similar for lower sigma values, but the sigma_mod VDF falls faster than the sigma_spec VDF at log sigma > 2.35
  * Very few galaxies are observed to have sigma > 350 km/s.
  * We also find that both late and early type galaxies have sigma_spec > sigma_mod, suggesting that the rotation component of most galaxies figure significantly into sigma_spec measurements.

* [Extended star-forming region within galaxies in a dense proto-cluster core at z=2.53](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.00695)
  * We conducted the Adaptive Optics(AO)-assisted imaging observations for star-forming galaxies in a dense proto-cluster core at z=2.53 with IRCS and AO188 mounted on the Subaru Telescope.
  * Resolved maps of Hα-emitting regions with an angular resolution of 0.1--0.2~arcsec, which corresponds to ∼1 kpc at z∼2.5.
  * We compare radial profiles of star-forming regions and stellar components and find that the star-forming region of a sub-sample with log(M∗/M⊙)∼10−11 is more extended than the stellar component, indicating the inside-out growth of the structure.
  * 和非proto-cluster环境的差不多

* [Measurement of the Extragalactic Background Light using MAGIC and Fermi-LAT gamma-ray observations of blazars up to z = 1](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.00134)
  * **Study**
  * Extragalactic background light (EBL) based on a joint likelihood analysis of 32 gamma-ray spectra for 12 blazars in the redshift range z = 0.03 to 0.944
  * The EBL can be studied indirectly through its effect on very-high energy photons that are emitted by cosmic sources and absorbed via photon-photon interactions during their propagation across cosmological distances. We obtain estimates of the EBL density in good agreement with state-of-the-art models of the EBL production and evolution.
  * No anomaly in the expected transparency of the universe to gamma rays is observed in any range of optical depth.
  * We also perform a wavelength-resolved EBL determination, which results in a hint of an excess of EBL in the 0.18 - 0.62 μm range relative to the studied models, yet compatible with them within systematics.

* [Satellites of Satellites: The Case for Carina and Fornax](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.01028)
  * 模拟: For galaxies as luminous as the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC), and for halos as massive as expected for the LMC (determined by its rotation speed), the simulations predict about ∼3 satellites with stellar masses exceeding M∗ > 10^5 M⊙
  * The new proper motions of the Fornax and Carina dwarf spheroidals place them on orbits closely aligned with the orbital plane of the Magellanic Clouds, hinting at a potential Magellanic association. Together with the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC), this result raises to 3 the number of LMC satellites
  * This also fills the 12-mag luminosity gap between the SMC and the ultra-faints Hyi1, Car2, Hor1, and Car3

* [A metal-poor ultra compact dwarf galaxy at a kiloparsec distance from the low-mass elliptical galaxy FCC47](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.01041)
  * **Relevant, Interesting**
  * We aim to characterise the properties of a UCD found at very close projected distance (rproj = 1.1 kpc) from the centre of the low-mass (M ∼ 10^10 M⊙) early-type galaxy FCC 47
  * FCC 47-UCD1’s surface brightness is best described by a single King profile with low concentration C = Rt /Rc ∼ 10 and large effective radius (reff = 24 pc).
  * Its integrated magnitude and a blue colour (Mg = −10.55 mag, (g − z) = 1.46 mag) combined with with a metallicity of [M/H] = −1.12 ± 0.10 dex and an age > 8 Gyr
  * we can only give an upper limit on the velocity dispersion (σ < 17 km s−1)
  * The low metallicity, old age and magnitude are consistent with a star cluster origin, whereas the extended size and high mass are consistent with an origin as the stripped nucleus of a dwarf galaxy with a initial stellar mass of a few 10^8 M⊙ .

* [The abundance and physical properties of O VII and O VIII X-ray absorption systems in the EAGLE simulations](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.01057)
  * 用EAGLE模拟：predict the column density and equivalent width distributions of intergalactic Ovii (E = 574eV) and O viii (E = 654 eV) absorbers at low redshift.
  * We find that their column density distributions evolve little at observable column densities from redshift 1 to 0, and that they are sensitive to AGN feedback (AGN feedback大幅度减少strong absorber的数量)
  * Absorption systems with N>10^16 cm−2 are dominated by collisionally ionized O vii and O viii, while the ionization state of oxygen at lower column densities is also influenced by photoionization
  * 在高柱密度的时候，不能简单的用OVII和OVIII的比值来估计温度

* [An old, metal-poor globular cluster in Sextans A and the metallicity floor of globular cluster systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.01084)
  * **Relevant**
  * We measure an integrated magnitude V = 18.04, corresponding to an absolute magnitude, MV,0 = −7.85. This gives an inferred mass M ∼1.6×10^5 M⊙
  * Stellar population analyses from the upper giant branch of the cluster, and its integrated optical spectrum, suggests a metallicity [Fe/H] ∼–2.4, and an age ∼ 9 Gyr.
  * We compile a sample of 1,928 GCs in 28 galaxies with spectroscopic metallicities and find that the low metallicity of Sextans A-GC1 is close to a ”metallicity floor” at [Fe/H] ∼–2.5

* [A Chandra and ALMA Study of X-ray-irradiated Gas in the Central ~100 pc of the Circinus Galaxy](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.01144)
  * Based on ~200 ksec Chandra/ACIS-S data, we created an image of the Fe Kalpha line at 6.4 keV, tracing X-ray-irradiated dense gas.
  * The molecular gas emission appeared faint in regions with bright iron emission: the molecular gas is efficiently dissociated by AGN X-ray irradiation (i.e., creating an X-ray-dominated region).
  * Furthermore, judging from inactive star formation (SF) reported in the literature, we suggest that the X-ray emission has potential to suppress SF

* [The Fornax 3D project: Thick disks in a cluster environment](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.01260)
  * **Relevant, Interesting**
  * These are both old, relatively metal poor and [Mg/Fe]-enhanced, and their star formation history (SFH) reveals a minor younger component whose chemical properties suggest its later accretion
  * The outer regions of these geometrically defined thick disks show higher values of metallicity and lower values of [Mg/Fe]. These stars probably formed in the thin-disk region and they were dynamically heated to form the flares present in these two galaxies.
  * A clear distinction in age is found between the metal poor and [Mg/Fe]-enhanced thick disks (old, ∼ 12 − 13 Gyr), and the metal rich and less [Mg/Fe]-enhanced thin disks (young, ∼ 4 − 5 Gyr).

* [Multiphase gas flows in the nearby Seyfert galaxy ESO428-G14](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.01483)
  * ALMA观测：We detect CO(2-1) emission from spiral arms and a circum-nuclear ring with 200 pc radius, and from a transverse gas lane with size of ∼ 100 pc, which crosses the nucleus and connects the two portions the circumnuclear ring.
  * In the inner 100 pc region CO is distributed in a equatorial bar, whose kinematics is highly perturbed and consistent with an inflow of gas towards the AGN.
  * CO bar和compton thick的区域重合，CO分子柱密度很高：molecular gas may contribute significantly to the AGN obscuration.
  * 看到了CO分子的外流，在700pc的距离上；The bi-conical outflow is also detected in the H2 emission line at 2.12 μm, which traces a warmer nuclear outflow located within 170 pc from the AGN. This suggests that the outflow cools with increasing distance from the AGN.

* [On the Detection of Supermassive Primordial Stars. II. Blue Supergiants](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.01507)
  * These stars have spectral features that are quite distinct from those of cooler stars and may have different detection limits in the near infrared (NIR) today.
  * We find that photometric detections of these stars by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) will be limited to z≲ 10 - 12, lower redshifts than those at which red stars can be found, because of quenching by their accretion envelopes.
  * With moderate gravitational lensing, Euclid and the Wide-Field Infrared Space Telescope (WFIRST) could detect blue supermassive stars out to similar redshifts in wide-field surveys.

* [Beyond BAO: improving cosmological constraints from BOSS with measurement of the void-galaxy cross-correlations](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.01030)
  * **Interesting**
  * We perform a joint fit to the data for redshift space distortions (RSD) due to galaxy peculiar velocities and anisotropies due to the Alcock-Paczynski (AP) effect
  * Fits to the void-galaxy function give a 1% measurement of the AP parameter combination DA(z)H(z)/c = 0.436 ± 0.005 at redshift z = 0.57, where DA is the angular diameter distance and H the Hubble parameter, exceeding the precision obtainable from baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) by a factor of ∼ 3.5
  * The parameter degeneracies are orthogonal to those obtained from galaxy clustering.

* [Measurements of effective optical depth in the Lyα forest from the BOSS DR12 Quasar sample](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.01110)
  * Measure the effective optical depth in the Lyman-alpha (Lyα) forest using 40,035 quasar from BOSS
  * 看光深的红移演化：Modeling the redshift evolution of the effective optical depth with a power-law, 红移演化的power-law指数在~3左右
  * Finally, using the reconstructed Lyα forest continuum to directly measure the transmitted flux ratio as a function of redshift, we find deviations of less than 2.5% from the predictions from the global model and no convincing evidence for signal associated with He II reionization.

* [Evidence for CII diffuse line emission at redshift z∼2.6](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.01181)
  * Recent work measured the C ii emission line amplitude for redshifts 2 < z < 3.2 by cross-correlating Planck High Frequency Instrument emission maps with tracers of overdensity from the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Sky Survey
  * We present a refinement of this earlier work by improving the mask weighting in each of the Planck bands and the precision in the covariance matrix.
  * 在545 GHz探测到了和CIB不同的信号, 符合红移后的CII线：which strongly favors many collisional excitation models of C ii emission.

* [Imaging the AGN Torus in Cygnus](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.01365)
  * First direct imaging of what may be the thick torus in the active galactic nucleus (AGN) of the archetype powerful radio galaxy Cygnus A, using the Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) at 18 GHz to 48 GHz, with a resolution down to 45 mas.
  * An elongated structure, perpendicular to the radio jets and centered on the core, is well resolved
  * The radio emission spectrum is consistent with optically thin free-free emission.

* [Ionization driven intrinsic absorption line variability of BAL quasars in the Stripe 82 region](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.02149)
  * the connection between the intrinsic C iv absorption line variability and the continuum flux changes of broad absorption line (BAL) quasars using a sample of 78 sources in the Stripe 82 region.
  * We find evidence for weak correlations (ρs ∼ 0.3) between the intrinsic C iv absorption line variability and the quasar continuum variability

* [Detailed dust modelling in the L-Galaxies semi-analytic model of galaxy formation](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.02196)

* [Molecular Gas Properties in the Host Galaxies of GRB080207](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.02196)
  * The host is detected in CO(1-0) and CO(4-3), becoming the first case for a GRB host with more than two CO transitions detected
  * The CO velocity field shows a clear rotation and is reproduced by a rotation-dominated disk model
  * The CO spectral line energy distribution derived from the four CO transitions is similar to that of starburst galaxies, suggesting a high excitation condition.

* [Ultraviolet Signatures of the Multiphase Intracluster and Circumgalactic Media in the RomulusC Simulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.02318)
  * We show that the ICM becomes increasingly multiphased at large radii, with the cool-warm gas becoming dominant in cluster outskirts. The diffuse cool-warm gas also exhibits a wider range of metallicity than the hot X-ray emitting gas.

* [Metallicity and ionization state of the gas in polar-ring galaxies](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.02513)
  * 13个确认的polar disk星系
  * We show that ionization by young stars dominates in the external parts of polar discs, while shocks have a significant contribution to gas excitation in the inner parts of polar structures.
  * The measured values of the gas metallicity almost do not depend on the galaxy luminosity. The radial [O/H] gradient in the considered polar rings is shallow or absent.

* [A Constant LGRB Metallicity Distribution Across Redshifts z < 2.5](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.02673)
  * We then find a curious consistency in the metallicity distribution across different redshifts. This is at odds with the general evolution in the mass metallicity relation of typical galaxies, which become progressively more metal poor with increasing redshift at constant mass
  * The estimated LGRB host metallicity distribution is approximately a quarter dex higher than the measured metallicity distribution at all redshifts.

### Apr 7

* [Spectroscopy of NGC 4258 globular cluster candidates: membership confirmation and kinematics](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.02712)
  * **Relevant**
  * 23个uiK颜色挑选出来的球状星团候选，OSIRIS观测：In the spectroscopy presented here, 70% of the candidates are confirmed as globular clusters.
  * We find that the GCs, mostly metal-poor, co-rotate with the HI disk, even at large galactocentric distances.

* [Evolution of galactic planes of satellites in the EAGLE simulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.02719)
  * EAGLE模拟：we introduce a robust method to identify the subsets of satellites that have the most co-planar orbits.
  * Purely flattened satellite systems are short-lived chance associations and persist for less than 1 Gyr. In contrast, satellite subsets that share roughly the same orbital plane are longer lived, with half of the MW-like systems being at least 4 Gyrs old.
  * On average, satellite systems were flatter in the past, with a minimum in their minor-to-major axes ratio about 9 Gyrs ago, which is the typical infall time of the classical satellites.

* [A Characteristic Mass Scale in the Mass-Metallicity Relation of Galaxies](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.02721)
  * **Interesting**
  * We observe a characteristic stellar mass scale at M∗≃10^9.5M⊙, above which the ISM undergoes a sharp increase in its level of chemical enrichment.
  * At approaching M∗≃10^9.5M⊙ the MZR steepens significantly, showing a slope of α=0.37±0.08 in the 10^9.5−10^10.5M⊙ range, and a flattening towards a constant metallicity at higher stellar masses.
  * High resolution hydrodynamical simulations can qualitatively reproduce our result, and suggest a transition in the ability of galaxies to retain their metals for stellar masses above this threshold.
  * The MZR characteristic mass scale also coincides with a transition in the scale height and clumpiness of cold gas disks, and a typical gas fraction below which the efficiency of star formation feedback for driving outflows is expected to decrease sharply.

* [EDGE I: the mass-metallicity relation as a critical test of galaxy formation physics](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.02723)
  * **Interesting**
  * 模拟研究dwarf：we explore the effects of resolution and sub-grid physics on a single low mass halo
  * On-the-fly辐射转移重要：We show that RT changes the mode of galactic self-regulation at this halo mass, suppressing star formation by causing the interstellar and circumgalactic gas to remain predominantly warm (∼10^4 K) even before cosmic reionisation
  * 能重现各种观测的scaling relation：This is because such structural scaling relations are predominantly set by the host dark matter halo
  * We find that only the stellar mass-metallicity relation differentiates the galaxy formation models. Explosive feedback ejects more metals from the dwarf, leading to a lower metallicity at a fixed stellar mass. 对于dwarf星系，质量-丰度关系很重要

* [A Catalog of the Most Optically Luminous Galaxies at z<0.3: Super Spirals, Super Lenticulars, Super Post-Mergers, and Giant Ellipticals](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.02806)
  * **Relevant, Useful**
  * We present a catalog of the 1525 most optically luminous galaxies from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) with r-band luminosity L_r > 8L* and redshift z<0.3, including 84 super spirals, 15 super lenticulars, 14 super post-merger galaxies, and 1400 giant ellipticals.
  * 这些大质量盘星系很有意思：The specific star formation rates of super spirals place them on or below the star-forming main sequence.
  * Their disks are red on the inside and blue on the outside, consistent with inside-out growth. They tend to have small bulge-to-total (B/T) r-band luminosity ratios, characteristic of disk building via minor mergers and cold accretion.
  * A large percentage of super disk galaxies (41%) have double nuclei, double disks, or other signatures of ongoing mergers. Most (72%) are found in moderate to low density environments, while the rest are found at the outskirts of clusters.

* [Jet Kinematics of the Quasar 4C +21.35 from Observations with the KaVA Very Long Baseline Interferometry Array](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.02894)
  * The timing of the ejection of a new component detected in 2016 is consistent with a gamma-ray flare in November 2014.
  * The discrepancy at 43 GHz indicates that radio arrays with different angular resolution identify and trace different jet features even when the data are obtained at the same frequency and at the same time.

* [Runaway Merger Shocks in Galaxy Cluster Outskirts and Radio Relics](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.03052)
  * 研究星系团并合产生的shock在星系际介质中继续传播的性质：In a uniform medium, such a "runaway" shock should weaken with distance. However, as shocks move to large radii in galaxy clusters, the shock is moving down a steep density gradient that helps the shock to maintain its strength over a large distance.
  * 在R500以外，气体密度轮廓会变陡，适合激波的维持。
  * A characteristic feature of runaway shocks is that the strong compression, relative to the initial state, is confined to a narrow region just behind the shock. This makes these shocks promising candidates for "igniting" radio relics via adiabatic compression of pre-existing populations of relativistic particles.

* [Detection of a double-peaked Hα component from the accretion disc of NGC 4958](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.03095)
  * 双峰Halpha线可以是吸积盘的证据：The narrow line region of this object has an emission that is typical of a LINER galaxy, which is the usual classification for double-peaked emitters.
  * We concluded that the double-peaked emission is emitted by a circular relativistic Keplerian disc

* [Fast Outflows Identified in Early Star-Forming Galaxies at z=5−6](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.03106)
  * 高红移10^10 Msun的恒星形成星系的外流速度测量，用ALMA [CII] 158micron线作为系统速度测量，用Keck观测前景吸收线测量外流 (composite光谱)
  * Fit outflow-line profiles to the SiII1260, CII1335, and SiIV1394,1403 absorption lines in the composite spectrum
  * We find the redshift evolution that the vmax value of our z=5-6 galaxies is higher than those of z=0 galaxies by a factor of 3.5 and comparable to the one of z=2 galaxies.

* [Young stellar populations in early-type dwarf galaxies; occurrence, radial extent and scaling relations](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.03108)
  * **Relevant, Interesting**
  * We compare the slopes and intrinsic scatter of color-magnitude relations (CMRs) for three nearby clusters, Fornax, Virgo and Coma.
  * Based on analysis of the color profiles, we report a large number of dEs with young stellar populations in their center in all three clusters.
  * While for Virgo and Coma the number of blue-cored dEs is found to be 85 +/- 2% and 53 +/- 3% respectively, for Fornax, we find that all galaxies have a blue core.
  * We show that bluer cores reside in fainter dEs, similar to the trend seen in nucleated dEs.
  * Presenting adaptive smoothing we show that the galaxies on the blue side of the CMR often show evidence for dust extinction, which strengthens the interpretation that the bluer colors are due to young stellar populations.
  * We also find that outliers on the red side of the CMR are more compact than expected for their luminosity. We find several of these red outliers in Virgo, often close to more massive galaxies.

* [Milky Way and Andromeda past-encounters in different gravity models: the impact on the estimated Local Group mass](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.03153)
  * 看M31和MW有没有之前的相遇：it is shown that if M31 and the MW had more than one encounter then the mass of the Local Group (LG) would be a few times higher than if there had been no encounters. Past encounters are possible only for non-zero transverse velocity, and their viability is subject to observations of the imprints of such near collisions.

* [Radio Galaxy Zoo: Knowledge Transfer Using Rotationally Invariant Self-Organising Maps](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.02876)
  * Here we discuss the challenges of transferring crowdsourced labels obtained from the Radio Galaxy Zoo project and introduce a proper transfer mechanism via quantile random forest regression.
  * By using parallelized rotation and flipping invariant Kohonen-maps, image cubes of Radio Galaxy Zoo selected galaxies formed from the FIRST radio continuum and WISE infrared all sky surveys are first projected down to a two-dimensional embedding in an unsupervised way.
  * In the second step, images are compared with those prototypes to create a heat-map, which is the morphological fingerprint of each object and the basis for transferring the user generated labels.
  * These heat-maps have reduced the feature space by a factor of 248 and are able to be used as the basis for subsequent ML methods.

### Apr 8

* [Observing AGN feedback with CO intensity mapping](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.03197)
  * Upcoming CO intensity mapping experiments offer an opportunity for a less biased probe of quasar feedback. By correlating intensity maps with spectroscopic AGN surveys, we can obtain a measurement of the mean CO luminosity of a large population of quasars simultaneously.
  * We show that experiments like COMAP, CCAT-prime, and CONCERTO have enough sensitivity to detect this cross-correlation if existing AGN observations are representative of the whole population

* [The Sloan Digital Sky Survey Reverberation Mapping Project: Initial CIV Lag Results from Four Years of Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.03199)
  * reverberation-mapping lags and black-hole mass measurements using the CIV 1549 broad emission line from a sample of 349 quasars
  * We report significant time delays between the continuum and the CIV 1549 emission line in 52 quasars, with an estimated false-positive detection rate of 10%.
  * 如果观测时间更长，还有更多的delay相关可以被观测到

* [Characterizing the local relation between star formation rate and gas-phase metallicity in MaNGA spiral galaxies](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.03930)
  * We have characterized the local relation between SFR and Zg after subtracting the azimuthally averaged radial profiles of both quantities. 60% of the analyzed galaxies display a SFR−Zg anti-correlation, with the remaining 40% showing no correlation (19%) or positive correlation (21%).
  * Thus, the local SFR−Zg slope varies with the average metallicity, with the more metal-poor galaxies presenting the lowest slopes (i.e., the strongest SFR−Zg anti-correlations)
  * Our results suggest that external gas accretion fuels star-formation in metal-poor galaxies, whereas in metal-rich systems the gas comes from previous star formation episodes.

  * **Interesting**
  * S4G里面正向盘星系：The ring fraction increases with bar Fourier density amplitude: this can be interpreted as evidence for the role of bars in ring formation.
  * The sizes of inner rings are positively correlated with bar strength: this can be linked to the radial displacement of the 1/4 ultra-harmonic resonance while the bar grows and the pattern speed decreases.
  * i) approximately ∼1/3 and ∼1/4 of the non-barred galaxies in the S4G host inner and outer rings, respectively;
  * ii) on average, the sizes and shapes of rings are roughly the same for barred and non-barred galaxies;
  * iii) the fraction of inner (outer) rings is a factor of 1.2−1.4 (1.65−1.9) larger in barred galaxies than in their non-barred counterparts.
  * We confirm, with the aid of SOMs, that rings are mainly hosted by red, massive, gas-deficient, dark-matter poor, and centrally concentrated galaxies.

  * QSO本身的clustering强，但是QSO周围星系的是不是一样还不清楚：Here we conduct a survey for Lyman alpha emitters (LAEs) in the environs of 17 quasars at z∼4 probing scales of R≲7h−1Mpc. We measure an average LAE overdensity around quasars of 1.4 for our full sample, which we quantify by fitting the quasar-LAE cross-correlation function.
  * We compare the observed clustering with the expectation from a deterministic bias model, whereby LAEs and quasars probe the same underlying dark matter overdensities, and find that our measurements fall short of the predicted overdensities by a factor of 2.1.

  * We show that regarding the external pressure as a positive feedback results in agreement with the observed distribution of enhanced star formation in the JFGs if clouds are shielded from evaporation by magnetic fields.

  * We use high-cadence simulation outputs to demonstrate that BH feedback pushes baryons beyond the virial radius within 100 Myr timescales, but that CGM metal tracers take longer (0.5-2.5 Gyr) to respond.

  * 光靠调整丰度模型似乎不能解决问题：We show that applying a model that includes empirical abundances scaled with metallicity strongly influences the thermal balance in HII regions and preserves the [O III]/H\b{eta} offset even in the presence of a harder radiation field generated by interacting binaries.
  * 需要额外的加热途径, 比如宇宙线加热。we demonstrate that cosmic ray heating serves as one mechanism capable of aligning spectral synthesis predictions with observations

  * We find that our results are well interpreted postulating that the orbital angular momentum is extracted by (i) the gravitational torque from the disk spiral structure, and (ii) tidal disruption of a gravitationally-bound envelope around the particle.

  * In the field, the key to their origin is a strong correlation present in low-mass dark matter haloes between galaxy size and halo spin parameter. Field UDGs form in dark matter haloes with larger spins compared to normal dwarfs in the field
  * Satellite UDGs, on the other hand, have two different origins: ∼55% of them formed as field UDGs before they were accreted; the remaining ∼45% were normal field dwarfs that subsequently turned into UDGs as a result of tidal interactions.

  * Combined with the 1283 redshifts published in DR1, the C3R2 survey has now obtained and published 4454 high quality galaxy redshifts.
  * We use the full spectroscopic sample to demonstrate that galaxy brightness is weakly correlated with redshift once a galaxy is localized in the Euclid or WFIRST color space, with potentially important implications for the spectroscopy needed to calibrate redshifts for faint WFIRST and LSST sources.

* [The Role of Major Mergers and Nuclear Star Formation in Nearby Obscured Quasars](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.06734)
  * Morphological classification reveals that only a minority (34%) of the hosts are mergers or interacting galaxies
  * More than half (55%) of the hosts contain regular disks, and a substantial fraction (38%), in fact, are disk-dominated (B/T≲0.2) late-type galaxies with low Sersic indices (n<2), which is characteristic of pseudo bulges.
  * The prevalence of bars in the spiral host galaxies may be sufficient to supply the modest fuel requirements needed to power the nuclear activity in these systems.
  * Nuclear star formation seems to be ubiquitous in the central regions, leading to positive color gradients within the bulges and enhancements in the central surface brightness of most systems.

  * Combined with the homogenous measurements of SN,z in 100 ETGs from the HST/ACS Virgo Cluster Survey from Peng et al. (2008), we investigate the dependence of SN,z on mass and environment over a range of galaxy properties
  * We find that SN,z behaves similarly in the two galaxy clusters, despite the clusters' order-of-magnitude difference in mass density
  * It is elevated at low masses, on average, but with a large scatter driven by galaxies in dense environments. The densest environments with the strongest tidal forces appear to strip the GC systems of low-mass galaxies.
  * However, in low-mass galaxies that are not in strong tidal fields, denser environments correlate with enhanced GC formation efficiencies
  * The lack of correlation between the fraction of GCs and the nuclear light implies only a weak link between the infall of GCs and the formation of nuclei.

  * We apply the quasar target selection algorithm on a modelled population of intrinsic colours, and by exploring the parameter space consisting of redshift, (zQSO and zabs), optical extinction, and HI column density, we demonstrate how the selection probability depends on these variables.
  * We quantify the dust bias on the following properties derived for DLAs at z=3: the incidence rate, the mass density of neutral hydrogen and metals, the average metallicity. We find that all quantities are significantly affected.

  * In short, the SPIRE lines indicate that the atomic and molecular gas in the CO-rich ETGs have similar properties to other galaxies. As might be expected from their low levels of star formation activity, the ETGs have rather low excitation CO SLEDs, low temperatures inferred from the [CI] lines, and modestly lower [CI]/CO ratios.

  * Thanks to its nearly mass independence the specific mass accretion rate of galaxy clusters is nearly insensitive to the calibration of mass-observable relations. The study of galaxy cluster number count evolution allows to probe the galaxy cluster mass accretion history in the context of an homogenous Universe.
  * Therefore, the MAR is a key cosmological probe that can break the σ8-Ωm degeneracy and that is not sensitive to the calibration of the mass-observable relations and does not requires a parametric form for the galaxy cluster mass-function.

  * Our most detailed dust model is based on continuum Monte Carlo radiative transfer calculations employing observationally calibrated dust properties. This calibration results in constraints on the redshift evolution of the dust attenuation normalisation and dust-to-metal ratios yielding a stronger redshift evolution of the attenuation normalisation compared to most previous theoretical studies.

  * Using archival optical and near infrared data with the energy-balance code CIGALE we calculate star formation rates, and stellar masses for all our cluster members, and find the star formation rate varies between 20-1600M⊙yr−1 over the entire 3Mpc radial range.
  * This indicates that there is indeed a reversal in the star formation/density relation in CLJ1449. Based on the radial star-formation rate density profile, we see evidence for an elevation in the star formation rate density, even out to radii of 3Mpc.

  * The Eddington ratios L_bol/L_Edd range from 0.16 to 1.1, but the majority of the HSC quasars are powered by M_BH=10^9 Msun SMBHs accreting at sub-Eddington rates.
  * The Eddington ratio distribution of the HSC quasars is inclined to lower accretion rates than those of Willott et al. (2010a), who measured the black hole masses for similarly faint z=6 quasars. This suggests that the global Eddington ratio distribution is wider than has previously been thought.

  * We consider very young star-forming galaxies at z=10 and incorporate the contribution from pre-main-sequence (PMS) stars. Unlike in the present-day galaxies, primordial protostars are not embedded in dusty gas clouds, and hence the light from them can be visible at a wide range of wavelengths.
  * We show that PMS stars contribute to boost the flux in mid-infrared, and that the galaxy SED at very early evolutionary phases is overall redder than at later phases.
  * We argue that the contribution from PMS stars is important for characterizing young galaxies in the early Universe and also for the target selection with future deep galaxy surveys.

We suggest that the diffuse nebula is due to a cold filament with high clumping factor illuminated by the QSO, with a required high clumpiness provided by unresolved residing halos

  * The velocity maps and PV-diagrams also suggest turbulent gas clumps in both objects
  * No evidence of order motion is detected in SDSS J1044-0125.
  * We tentatively detect a [CII] peak offset 4.9 kpc to the East of SDSS J1044-0125. This may be associated with an infalling companion, or node of gas outflows

* [Next generation cosmography with strong lensing and stellar dynamics](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.07237)
  * **Interesting**
  * A joint strong lensing and stellar dynamical framework for future time-delay cosmography purposes
  * Based on a pixelated source reconstruction and the axisymmetric Jeans equations, we are capable of constraining cosmological distances and hence the current expansion rate of the Universe (H0) to the few percent level per lens, when high signal-to-noise integral field unit (IFU) observations from the next generation of telescopes become available.
  * The measurement accuracy of Dd, however, is highly sensitive to any systematics in the measurement of the stellar kinematics. For both distance measurements, we strongly advise to probe a large set of physically motivated lens potentials in the future, to minimise the systematic errors associated with the lens mass parameterisation.

* [Virgo: an unlikely cluster of galaxies because of its environment](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.07253)
  * This paper presents such a statistical study with 200 Virgo-like and 400+ cluster-size random dark matter halos. Only 18%(0.5%) of these random halos comply within 3(2)-sigma with the mean values (radius, velocity dispersion, number of substructures, spin, velocity, concentration, center of mass offset with respect to the spherical center) of Virgo halos at z=0 and abide by a similar merging history up to redshift 4.
  * This highlights the importance of studying clusters within their proper large scale environment: simulated galaxy population, grandly affected by the cluster history, can then be compared with the observed one in details.

  * We constrain richness-mass relations P(lnN|M,z) of the HSC CAMIRA clusters assuming a log-normal distribution without informative priors on model parameters, by jointly fitting to the lensing profiles and abundance measurements under both Planck and WMAP cosmological models.
  * We also show that the scatter values for the Planck model increase toward lower richness values, whereas those for the WMAP model are consistent with constant values as a function of richness. This result highlights the importance of the scatter in the mass-richness relation for cluster cosmology.

* [Evolution of the mass-richness relation for the redMaPPer catalog](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.07610)

  * we expect the present galaxy cluster mass function to be the same everywhere in the Universe. Using relative abundance matching, we contraint the relation between the richness, λ(z), and the expected present mass, M(t0), of galaxy clusters.
  * This results implies that the redMaPPer richness appears to be a better proxy for the expected present-day galaxy cluster mass than for the mass at the observational redshift.

  * We develop a formalism for constraining mass profiles in strong gravitational lenses with extended images, using fluxes in addition to positional information
  * We start in this paper with a circular power-law profile and show that the slope γ is uniquely determined by only two observables: the flux ratio f1/ f2 and the image position ratio θ1/θ2 of the two images.
  * We derive an analytic expression relating these two observables to the slope, a result which does not depend on the Einstein angle or the structure or brightness of the source

  * The invariance in the large time interval, the absence of the blue system in He I λ10830 profile and the abnormally strong emission of the hydrogen Paβ blue system oppose the binary proposal.
  * These unique broad lines arise from the AGN emission-line region and the shock-heated outflowing gases

  * The blue-nugget phase is responsible for transitions in the galaxy structural, kinematic and compositional properties, e.g., from dark-matter to baryon central dominance and from prolate to oblate shape.
  * A compaction near the golden mass makes the black hole sink to the galactic center and triggers a rapid black-hole growth. This ignites feedback by the Active Galactic Nucleus that helps keeping the CGM hot and maintaining long-term quenching.

* [The Herschel Dwarf Galaxy Survey: II. Physical conditions, origin of [CII] emission, and porosity of the multiphase low-metallicity ISM](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.08434)
  * We find that the lower-metallicity galaxies of our sample tend to have higher ionization parameters and galaxies with higher specific star-formation rates have higher gas densities.
  * The [CII] emission arises mainly from PDRs and the contribution from the ionized gas phases is small, typically less than 30% of the observed emission
  * Overall, the low metal abundances appear to be driving most of the changes in the ISM structure and conditions of these galaxies, and not the high specific star-formation rates.
  * These results demonstrate in a quantitative way the increase of ISM porosity at low metallicity. Such porosity may be typical of galaxies in the young Universe. 多孔性

  * L*星系的OVI吸收系统速度弥散最大：halo virial temperature closely matches the temperature at which the collisionally ionized OVI fraction peaks.
  * After normalizing out the observed mass dependence, we studied absorber-galaxy kinematics with a modified TPCF and found non-virialized motions due to outflowing gas.
  * Edge-on minor axis gas has large optical depths concentrated near the galaxy systemic velocity as expected for bipolar outflows, while face-on minor axis gas has a smoothly decreasing optical depth distribution out to large normalized absorber-galaxy velocities, suggestive of decelerating outflowing gas

* [SkyMapper SEDs of nearby galaxies: quenching and bursting probed by a change index for star formation](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.08564)

  * The index responds mostly to changes in star-formation rate on a timescale of 20 to 500 Myr and is nearly insensitive to dust extinction 对到100-150 Mpc以内都有效

  * We model the radial integral constraint for a Redshift Space Distortions (RSD) analysis but we emphasise that it can be of paramount importance for large-scale studies of primordial non-Gaussianity.

Detection of dust reverberation lag signals between V- and K-band light curves obtained by the MAGNUM project during the faint state in 2003-2007 suggests that the dust torus innermost radius Rdust of Mrk 590 had become very small (Rdust≃32 light-days) by the year 2004

  * As the TDE is located in the TESS Continuous Viewing Zone, our dataset includes 30-minute cadence observations of the transient and its host dating to the start of TESS Sector 1
  * ASASSN-19bt thus has the most detailed pre-peak dataset for any TDE, allowing us to better model the early emission of a TDE than has been previously possible.
  * From the TESS light curve, we find that the transient began to brighten on 2019 January 21.6 and that its initial rise was consistent with a flux ∝ t^2 power-law model.

  * We forecast how systematic biases in the redshift-dependent galaxy-dark matter bias model affect redshift inference.
  * If the redshift-dependent galaxy-dark matter bias model is mis-specified, redshift inference can be biased. This can propagate into relative biases in the weak lensing convergence power spectrum on the 10\% - 30\% level.

  * Using techniques based on Tremaine & Richstone (1977), we show that there is no problem with the luminosity function computed from modern codes per se, but that the gap between first and second brightest systems is too big {\it given} the luminosity function
  * The same large gap is found in modern, large scale baryonic ΛCDM simulations such as EAGLE and IllustrisTNG, is even greater in dark matter only simulations, and finally, that this is most likely due to gravitationally induced merging caused by classical dynamical friction.
  * Briefly stated, ΛCDM does not have a problem with an absence of "too big to fail" galaxies. Statistically significant large gaps between first and second brightest galaxies are to be expected.

  * A study of 21 dark gamma-ray burst (GRB) host galaxies, predominantly using X-ray afterglows obtained with the Chandra X-Ray Observatory (CXO)
  * In agreement with other studies, we find that dark GRB hosts are redder and more luminous than the bulk of the GRB host population.
  * The dark GRB hosts are physically larger, more massive and redder, but are morphologically similar to the hosts of bright GRBs in terms of concentration and asymmetry.
  * If dust is the primary cause of afterglow darkening amongst dark GRBs, the measured extinction may require a clumpy dust component in order to explain the observed offset and ellipticity distributions.

  * Gemini光谱观测，几年内亮度下降1.5 mag以上；0.5 < z < 2.1.
  * The broad Mg II flux varies in the same direction as the continuum flux, albeit with a smaller amplitude, which indicates at least some portion of Mg II is reverberating to continuum changes.
  * However, the width (FWHM) of Mg II does not vary accordingly as continuum changes for most objects in the sample, in contrast to the case of the broad Balmer lines. Using the width of broad Mg II to estimate the black hole mass therefore introduces a luminosity-dependent bias.

* [Signatures of resonance and phase mixing in the Galactic disc](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.10968)
  * We confront the data with a range of bar and spiral models in both action-angle space, and the RG−vϕ plane. We find that the phase mixing induced by transient spiral structure creates ridges and arches in the local kinematics which are consistent with the Gaia data
  * We are able to produce a qualitatively good match to the data when combined with a bar with a variety of pattern speeds, and show that it is non trivial to decouple the effects of the bar and the spiral structure.

* [The X-ray Halo Scaling Relations of Supermassive Black Holes](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.10972)
  * **Important, Useful**
  * 看黑洞质量和X-ray性质的关系：We analyze fundamental and composite X-ray variables (plasma temperature, luminosity, density, pressure, and gas/total masses) from galactic to cluster scales. We show novel key scalings, with the tightest relation being the M∙−Tx, followed by M∙−Lx (scatter 0.2-0.3 dex).
  * 这些关系往往比用stellar性质得到的SMBH scaling relation紧致：suggest that the plasma atmospheres play a more central role than the stellar component in the growth of SMBHs (and ultramassive BHs), in particular accounting for the group/cluster core halo.
  * The derived gas mass scalings also correlate better with M∙ than dark matter mass.
    * 没想好这是为什么？？？
  * 最后还是推广了一下Chaotic Cold Accretion模型：The scalings are consistent with the predictions of CCA, the rain of matter condensing out of the turbulent X-ray halos, sustaining a self-regulated feedback loop throughout cosmic time.

* [Self-consistent predictions for LIER-like emission lines from post-AGB stars](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.10978)
  * **Interesting**
  * We present the first prediction of LIER-like emission from post-AGB stars that is based on fully self-consistent stellar evolution and photoionization models
  * We show that models where post-AGB stars are the dominant source of ionizing photons reproduce the nebular emission signatures observed in ETGs, including LIER-like emission line ratios in standard optical diagnostic diagrams and Hα equivalent widths of order 0.1-3 angstroms.
  * Finally, we examine the UV-optical colors of the models and the stellar populations responsible for the UV-excess observed in some ETGs. We find that allowing as little as 3% of the HB population to be uniformly distributed to very hot temperatures (30,000 K) produces realistic UV colors for old, quiescent ETGs.

* [Half-mass radii for ~7,000 galaxies at 1.0 < z < 2.5: most of the evolution in the mass-size relation is due to color gradients](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.10992)
  * **Interesting, Important**
  * 利用多波段HST图像估计M/L梯度，看R50_light和R_50_mass的区别：Here we present the largest catalog to date of galaxy half-mass radii at z > 1: 7,006 galaxies in the CANDELS fields at 1.0 < z < 2.5.
  * In agreement with previous studies, most galaxies in our sample have negative color gradients (the centers are redder than the outskirts, and r_e,mass < r_e,light).
  * We find that color gradient strength has significant trends with increasing stellar mass, half-light radius, U-V color, and stellar mass surface density.
  * Furthermore, color gradients of star-forming and quiescent galaxies show a similar redshift evolution: they are flat at z>~2, then steeply decrease as redshift decreases. This affects the galaxy mass-size relation.
  * Finally, the half-mass radii of star-forming and quiescent galaxies at M_* = 10^{10.5}M_\odot only grow by ~1%$ and ~8% between z~2.25 and z~1.25. This is significantly less than the ~37% and ~47% size increases found when using the half-light radius.

* [The Nature of Ionized Gas in the Milky Way Galactic Fountain](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.11014)
  * 利用银河系恒星来探测银河系的IGM:We address the spatial scale, ionization structure and metal content of gas at the Milky Way disk-halo interface detected as absorption in the foreground of seven halo blue horizontal branch stars (BHBs).
  * With our high-resolution, S/N > 14, HST/COS and Keck/HIRES spectra, we constrain the distances, velocities, sizes, and carbon content of infalling, intermediate-velocity gaseous structures
  * We detect transitions that trace multiple ionization states (e.g. CaII, FeII, SiIV, CIV) with column densities that remain constant with height from the disk, indicating that the gas most likely lies within z < 3.4 kpc.
  * The intermediate ionization state gas traced by CIV and SiIV is strongly correlated over the full range of transverse separations probed by our sightlines, indicating large, coherent structures greater than 500 pc in size; 低电离气体则非常clumpy，尺度应该小于10 pc
  * Our data directly support a physical scenario in which the Milky Way is fed by complex, multiphase processes at its disk-halo interface that involve kpc-scale ionized envelopes or streams containing pc-scale, cool clumps.

* [Dust production scenarios in galaxies at z ~ 6-8.3](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.11185)
  * 非恒星演化过程也可能对尘埃产生做贡献：non-stellar processes may substantially contribute to dust production, for example grain growth in the interstellar medium (ISM)
  * We find that AGB stars were not able to produce the amounts of dust observed in the galaxies in our sample. In order to explain these dust masses, SNe would have to have maximum efficiency and not destroy the dust which they formed. 所以，可能要考虑ISM过程

* [GABE: Galaxy Assembly with Binary Evolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.11224)
  * We find that in the local universe the model including binary evolution reduces the luminosity at optical and infrared wavelengths slightly, while increases the luminosity at ultraviolet wavelength significantly, especially in FUV band.
  * The new model allows us to explore the physics of various high energy events related to the remnants of binary stars, e.g. type Ia supernovae, short gamma-ray bursts and gravitational wave events, and their relation with host galaxies in a cosmological context.

* [What drives the velocity dispersion of ionized gas in star-forming galaxies?](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.11431)
  * By combining with high z galaxies, we found that there is a good correlation between the velocity dispersion and the SFR as well as ΣSFR. But the correlation between the velocity dispersion and the stellar mass as well as Σ∗ is moderate.
  * we found that the energy feedback from star formation processes alone and the gravitational instability alone can not fully explain simultaneously the observed velocity-dispersion/SFR and velocity-dispersion/ΣSFR relationships.

* [Galaxy Zoo: Unwinding the Winding Problem - Observations of Spiral Bulge Prominence and Arm Pitch Angles Suggest Local Spiral Galaxies are Winding](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.11431)
  * We demonstrate that, in modern usage, the spiral classifications Sa-Sd are predominantly based on bulge size, with no reference to spiral arms.
  * Galaxies with small bulges have a wide range of arm winding, while those with larger bulges favour tighter arms. This observation, interpreted as revealing a variable winding speed as a function of bulge size, may be providing evidence that the majority of spiral arms are not static density waves, but rather wind-up over time
  * We further observe that galaxies exhibiting strong bars tend have more loosely wound arms at a given bulge size than unbarred spirals. This observations suggests that the presence of a bar may slow the winding speed of spirals, and may also drive other processes (such as density waves) which generate spiral arms.

* [Multi-Filament Inflows Fueling Young Star Forming Galaxies](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.11465)
  * **Interesting**
  * KCWI观测之前探测到inflow的两个QSO-LyAlpha：With the Keck Cosmic Web Imager (KCWI) we now have eight times the spatial resolution, permitting the detection of these in-spiraling flows. 
  * In order to detect these inflows, we introduce a suite of models which incorporate zonal radial flows, demonstrate their performance on a numerical simulation that exhibits coldflow accretion, and show that they are an excellent match to KCWI velocity maps of two Ly{\alpha} emitters observed around high-redshift quasars.
  * The derived gas flux and inflow path is sufficient to fuel the inferred central galaxy star formation rate and angular momentum. Thus, our kinematic emission maps provide strong evidence for the inflow of gas from the cosmic web building galaxies at the peak of star formation.

* [Astrometric requirements for strong lensing time-delay cosmography](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.11965)
  * To convert the time delay into distances, it is well known that the gravitational potential of the main deflector and the contribution of the matter along the line-of-sight need to be known to a sufficient level of precision.
  * We derive an analytic expression for the propagation of astrometric uncertainties on the multiple image positions into the inference of the Hubble constant and derive requirements depending on image separation and relative time delay. 
  * To illustrate the requirement, we discuss some example lensing configurations and highlight that, especially for time delays of order 10 days or shorter, the relative astrometric requirement is of order milli-arcseconds.

* [A New Class of Changing-Look LINERs](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.11973)

  * We report the discovery of six active galactic nuclei (AGN) caught "turning on" during the first nine months of the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) survey
  * In five of the cases, we found via follow-up spectroscopy that they had transformed into broad-line AGN, reminiscent of the changing-look LINER iPTF 16bco
  * In one case, ZTF18aajupnt/AT2018dyk, follow-up HST UV and ground-based optical spectra revealed the transformation into a narrow-line Seyfert 1 (NLS1) with strong [Fe VII, X, XIV] and He II 4686 coronal lines.
    * 有Optical和X-ray的flaire，且有时间延迟，X-ray的peak出现得更晚 
  * They are a unique class of transients related to physical processes associated with the LINER accretion state.
