* [Measuring Star-Formation Histories, Distances, and Metallicities with Pixel Color-Magnitude Diagrams I: Model Definition and Mock Tests](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.00011)
  * **Interesting, Useful**
  * Here we present Pixel Color-Magnitude Diagrams with Python (pcmdpy), a GPU-accelerated package that makes significant computational improvements to the original code and including more realistic physical models.
  * These advances include the simultaneous fitting of distance, modeling a Gaussian metallicity-distribution function, and an observationally-motivated dust model.
  * Our results suggest the code, applied to observations with HST-like resolution, should constrain these properties with high precision within 10 Mpc and can be applied to systems out to as far as 100 Mpc.

* [The evolution of the quenching of star formation in cluster galaxies since z ∼ 1](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.00011)
  * **Relevant**
  * 看HSC数据中209 IR-selected galaxy clusters at 0.3≤z≤1.1 in the ELAIS-N1 and XMM-LSS fields的恒星形成星系
  * Using R/R200 to trace environment, we observe a decrease in fSF from the field towards the cluster core, which strongly depends on stellar mass and redshift.
  * Finally, we find that environmental and mass quenching efficiencies depend on galaxy stellar mass and distance to the center of the cluster, demonstrating that the two effects are not separable in the cluster environment.

* [Major mergers are not the dominant trigger for high-accretion AGNs at z = 2](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.00037)
  * We examine 21 galaxies hosting a high accreting black hole (L/Ledd > 0.7) observed with HST/WFC3 and 92 stellar mass- and redshift- matched inactive galaxies taken from the CANDELS survey.
  * 把AGN贡献扣除后，打乱再分类：The resulting samples were joined, randomized, and subsequently visually ranked with respect to perceived strength of structural distortions by 10 experts.
  * With the merger fractions fm,agn = 0.24 ± 0.09 for the AGN host galaxy sample and fm,ina = 0.19 ± 0.04 for the inactive galaxies, we find no significant difference between the AGN host galaxies and inactive galaxies

* [The Extended Disk Galaxy Exploration Science Survey: Description and Surface Brightness Profile Properties](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.00050)
  * **Relevant, Interesting**
  * EDGES is a Spitzer Space Telescope Warm Mission program designed to reach the surface brightness limit (∼0.5 kJy sr−1 or 29 AB mag arcsec−2) of the Infrared Array Camera (IRAC) 3.6 and 4.5 μm bands for a wide range of galaxy types found within the local volume.
  * The surface brightness profiles exhibit a large range in disc scalelength, with breaks more frequently seen than in previous studies, owing in large part to the extremely deep near-infrared imaging.
  * A number of these surface brightness profile breaks may be due to stellar halos, up to 7 galaxies out of the full sample of 92 galaxies 

* [The molecular-gas properties in the gravitationally lensed merger HATLAS J142935.3-002836](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.00307)
  * New APEX observations targeting two carbon monoxide (CO) rotational transitions J_up=3 and 6.
  * We show that the line-profiles comprise three distinct velocity components, where the fainter high-velocity one is less magnified and more compact.
  * The detected gas and dust emission comes exclusively from only one of the two merging components

* [Giant radio galaxies in the LOFAR Two-metre Sky Survey-I](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.00409)
  * **Interesting**
  * GRGs are much rarer than normal sized radio galaxies ( less than 0.7 Mpc) and the reason for their gigantic sizes is still debated
  * 本文展示了从LFAR LoTSS中得到的最大的巨射电星系样本： Of the 240 GRGs found, 228 are new discoveries. The GRGs have sizes ranging from 0.7 to 3.5 Mpc and have redshifts between 0.1 and 2.3. Seven GRGs have sizes above 2 Mpc and one has a size of ~ 3.5 Mpc.
  * We also find that 21 GRGs are located in dense galaxy cluster/group environments, which were identified using optical data.
  * 射电谱指数和普通的射点星系差别不大

* [The time delay between star formation quenching and morphological transformation of galaxies in clusters: a phase-space view of EDisCS](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.00466)
  * Explore the possible effect of cluster environments on the structure and star formation histories of galaxies by analysing the projected phase-space (PPS) of intermediate-redshift cluster (0.4<z<0.8).
  * we establish that in all environments younger star-forming galaxies of all morphologies are 'rougher' (REF高) and more asymmetric than older, more quiescent ones.
  * Find a significant correlation between the position of the galaxies on the PPS and their stellar ages, irrespective of their morphology.
    * These results may imply that, transformation happens on a longer timescale as they accumulate and age in the cluster cores.

* [Galaxies and Supermassive Black Holes at z <= 0.1: The Velocity Dispersion Function](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.00486)
  * **Important, Relevant**
  * SDSS星系的VDF研究：We compare two different sigma estimates; one based on SDSS spectroscopy (sigma_spec) and another on photometric estimates (sigma_mod).
  * The VDFs measured from these quantities are remarkably similar for lower sigma values, but the sigma_mod VDF falls faster than the sigma_spec VDF at log sigma > 2.35
  * Very few galaxies are observed to have sigma > 350 km/s.
  * We also find that both late and early type galaxies have sigma_spec > sigma_mod, suggesting that the rotation component of most galaxies figure significantly into sigma_spec measurements.

* [Extended star-forming region within galaxies in a dense proto-cluster core at z=2.53](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.00695)
  * We conducted the Adaptive Optics(AO)-assisted imaging observations for star-forming galaxies in a dense proto-cluster core at z=2.53 with IRCS and AO188 mounted on the Subaru Telescope.
  * Resolved maps of Hα-emitting regions with an angular resolution of 0.1--0.2~arcsec, which corresponds to ∼1 kpc at z∼2.5.
  * We compare radial profiles of star-forming regions and stellar components and find that the star-forming region of a sub-sample with log(M∗/M⊙)∼10−11 is more extended than the stellar component, indicating the inside-out growth of the structure.
  * 和非proto-cluster环境的差不多

* [Measurement of the Extragalactic Background Light using MAGIC and Fermi-LAT gamma-ray observations of blazars up to z = 1](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.00134)
  * **Study**
  * Extragalactic background light (EBL) based on a joint likelihood analysis of 32 gamma-ray spectra for 12 blazars in the redshift range z = 0.03 to 0.944
  * The EBL can be studied indirectly through its effect on very-high energy photons that are emitted by cosmic sources and absorbed via photon-photon interactions during their propagation across cosmological distances. We obtain estimates of the EBL density in good agreement with state-of-the-art models of the EBL production and evolution.
  * No anomaly in the expected transparency of the universe to gamma rays is observed in any range of optical depth.
  * We also perform a wavelength-resolved EBL determination, which results in a hint of an excess of EBL in the 0.18 - 0.62 μm range relative to the studied models, yet compatible with them within systematics.
