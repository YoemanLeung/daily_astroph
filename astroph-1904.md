* [Measuring Star-Formation Histories, Distances, and Metallicities with Pixel Color-Magnitude Diagrams I: Model Definition and Mock Tests](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.00011)
  * **Interesting, Useful**
  * Here we present Pixel Color-Magnitude Diagrams with Python (pcmdpy), a GPU-accelerated package that makes significant computational improvements to the original code and including more realistic physical models.
  * These advances include the simultaneous fitting of distance, modeling a Gaussian metallicity-distribution function, and an observationally-motivated dust model.
  * Our results suggest the code, applied to observations with HST-like resolution, should constrain these properties with high precision within 10 Mpc and can be applied to systems out to as far as 100 Mpc.

* [The evolution of the quenching of star formation in cluster galaxies since z ∼ 1](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.00011)
  * **Relevant**
  * 看HSC数据中209 IR-selected galaxy clusters at 0.3≤z≤1.1 in the ELAIS-N1 and XMM-LSS fields的恒星形成星系
  * Using R/R200 to trace environment, we observe a decrease in fSF from the field towards the cluster core, which strongly depends on stellar mass and redshift.
  * Finally, we find that environmental and mass quenching efficiencies depend on galaxy stellar mass and distance to the center of the cluster, demonstrating that the two effects are not separable in the cluster environment.

* [Major mergers are not the dominant trigger for high-accretion AGNs at z = 2](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.00037)
  * We examine 21 galaxies hosting a high accreting black hole (L/Ledd > 0.7) observed with HST/WFC3 and 92 stellar mass- and redshift- matched inactive galaxies taken from the CANDELS survey.
  * 把AGN贡献扣除后，打乱再分类：The resulting samples were joined, randomized, and subsequently visually ranked with respect to perceived strength of structural distortions by 10 experts.
  * With the merger fractions fm,agn = 0.24 ± 0.09 for the AGN host galaxy sample and fm,ina = 0.19 ± 0.04 for the inactive galaxies, we find no significant difference between the AGN host galaxies and inactive galaxies

* [The Extended Disk Galaxy Exploration Science Survey: Description and Surface Brightness Profile Properties](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.00050)
  * **Relevant, Interesting**
  * EDGES is a Spitzer Space Telescope Warm Mission program designed to reach the surface brightness limit (∼0.5 kJy sr−1 or 29 AB mag arcsec−2) of the Infrared Array Camera (IRAC) 3.6 and 4.5 μm bands for a wide range of galaxy types found within the local volume.
  * The surface brightness profiles exhibit a large range in disc scalelength, with breaks more frequently seen than in previous studies, owing in large part to the extremely deep near-infrared imaging.
  * A number of these surface brightness profile breaks may be due to stellar halos, up to 7 galaxies out of the full sample of 92 galaxies

* [The molecular-gas properties in the gravitationally lensed merger HATLAS J142935.3-002836](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.00307)
  * New APEX observations targeting two carbon monoxide (CO) rotational transitions J_up=3 and 6.
  * We show that the line-profiles comprise three distinct velocity components, where the fainter high-velocity one is less magnified and more compact.
  * The detected gas and dust emission comes exclusively from only one of the two merging components

* [Giant radio galaxies in the LOFAR Two-metre Sky Survey-I](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.00409)
  * **Interesting**
  * GRGs are much rarer than normal sized radio galaxies ( less than 0.7 Mpc) and the reason for their gigantic sizes is still debated
  * 本文展示了从LFAR LoTSS中得到的最大的巨射电星系样本： Of the 240 GRGs found, 228 are new discoveries. The GRGs have sizes ranging from 0.7 to 3.5 Mpc and have redshifts between 0.1 and 2.3. Seven GRGs have sizes above 2 Mpc and one has a size of ~ 3.5 Mpc.
  * We also find that 21 GRGs are located in dense galaxy cluster/group environments, which were identified using optical data.
  * 射电谱指数和普通的射点星系差别不大

* [The time delay between star formation quenching and morphological transformation of galaxies in clusters: a phase-space view of EDisCS](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.00466)
  * Explore the possible effect of cluster environments on the structure and star formation histories of galaxies by analysing the projected phase-space (PPS) of intermediate-redshift cluster (0.4<z<0.8).
  * we establish that in all environments younger star-forming galaxies of all morphologies are 'rougher' (REF高) and more asymmetric than older, more quiescent ones.
  * Find a significant correlation between the position of the galaxies on the PPS and their stellar ages, irrespective of their morphology.
    * These results may imply that, transformation happens on a longer timescale as they accumulate and age in the cluster cores.

* [Galaxies and Supermassive Black Holes at z <= 0.1: The Velocity Dispersion Function](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.00486)
  * **Important, Relevant**
  * SDSS星系的VDF研究：We compare two different sigma estimates; one based on SDSS spectroscopy (sigma_spec) and another on photometric estimates (sigma_mod).
  * The VDFs measured from these quantities are remarkably similar for lower sigma values, but the sigma_mod VDF falls faster than the sigma_spec VDF at log sigma > 2.35
  * Very few galaxies are observed to have sigma > 350 km/s.
  * We also find that both late and early type galaxies have sigma_spec > sigma_mod, suggesting that the rotation component of most galaxies figure significantly into sigma_spec measurements.

* [Extended star-forming region within galaxies in a dense proto-cluster core at z=2.53](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.00695)
  * We conducted the Adaptive Optics(AO)-assisted imaging observations for star-forming galaxies in a dense proto-cluster core at z=2.53 with IRCS and AO188 mounted on the Subaru Telescope.
  * Resolved maps of Hα-emitting regions with an angular resolution of 0.1--0.2~arcsec, which corresponds to ∼1 kpc at z∼2.5.
  * We compare radial profiles of star-forming regions and stellar components and find that the star-forming region of a sub-sample with log(M∗/M⊙)∼10−11 is more extended than the stellar component, indicating the inside-out growth of the structure.
  * 和非proto-cluster环境的差不多

* [Measurement of the Extragalactic Background Light using MAGIC and Fermi-LAT gamma-ray observations of blazars up to z = 1](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.00134)
  * **Study**
  * Extragalactic background light (EBL) based on a joint likelihood analysis of 32 gamma-ray spectra for 12 blazars in the redshift range z = 0.03 to 0.944
  * The EBL can be studied indirectly through its effect on very-high energy photons that are emitted by cosmic sources and absorbed via photon-photon interactions during their propagation across cosmological distances. We obtain estimates of the EBL density in good agreement with state-of-the-art models of the EBL production and evolution.
  * No anomaly in the expected transparency of the universe to gamma rays is observed in any range of optical depth.
  * We also perform a wavelength-resolved EBL determination, which results in a hint of an excess of EBL in the 0.18 - 0.62 μm range relative to the studied models, yet compatible with them within systematics.

* [Satellites of Satellites: The Case for Carina and Fornax](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.01028)
  * 模拟: For galaxies as luminous as the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC), and for halos as massive as expected for the LMC (determined by its rotation speed), the simulations predict about ∼3 satellites with stellar masses exceeding M∗ > 10^5 M⊙
  * The new proper motions of the Fornax and Carina dwarf spheroidals place them on orbits closely aligned with the orbital plane of the Magellanic Clouds, hinting at a potential Magellanic association. Together with the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC), this result raises to 3 the number of LMC satellites
  * This also fills the 12-mag luminosity gap between the SMC and the ultra-faints Hyi1, Car2, Hor1, and Car3

* [A metal-poor ultra compact dwarf galaxy at a kiloparsec distance from the low-mass elliptical galaxy FCC47](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.01041)
  * **Relevant, Interesting**
  * We aim to characterise the properties of a UCD found at very close projected distance (rproj = 1.1 kpc) from the centre of the low-mass (M ∼ 10^10 M⊙) early-type galaxy FCC 47
  * FCC 47-UCD1’s surface brightness is best described by a single King profile with low concentration C = Rt /Rc ∼ 10 and large effective radius (reff = 24 pc).
  * Its integrated magnitude and a blue colour (Mg = −10.55 mag, (g − z) = 1.46 mag) combined with with a metallicity of [M/H] = −1.12 ± 0.10 dex and an age > 8 Gyr
  * we can only give an upper limit on the velocity dispersion (σ < 17 km s−1)
  * The low metallicity, old age and magnitude are consistent with a star cluster origin, whereas the extended size and high mass are consistent with an origin as the stripped nucleus of a dwarf galaxy with a initial stellar mass of a few 10^8 M⊙ .

* [The abundance and physical properties of O VII and O VIII X-ray absorption systems in the EAGLE simulations](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.01057)
  * 用EAGLE模拟：predict the column density and equivalent width distributions of intergalactic Ovii (E = 574eV) and O viii (E = 654 eV) absorbers at low redshift.
  * We find that their column density distributions evolve little at observable column densities from redshift 1 to 0, and that they are sensitive to AGN feedback (AGN feedback大幅度减少strong absorber的数量)
  * Absorption systems with N>10^16 cm−2 are dominated by collisionally ionized O vii and O viii, while the ionization state of oxygen at lower column densities is also influenced by photoionization
  * 在高柱密度的时候，不能简单的用OVII和OVIII的比值来估计温度

* [An old, metal-poor globular cluster in Sextans A and the metallicity floor of globular cluster systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.01084)
  * **Relevant**
  * We measure an integrated magnitude V = 18.04, corresponding to an absolute magnitude, MV,0 = −7.85. This gives an inferred mass M ∼1.6×10^5 M⊙
  * Stellar population analyses from the upper giant branch of the cluster, and its integrated optical spectrum, suggests a metallicity [Fe/H] ∼–2.4, and an age ∼ 9 Gyr.
  * We compile a sample of 1,928 GCs in 28 galaxies with spectroscopic metallicities and find that the low metallicity of Sextans A-GC1 is close to a ”metallicity floor” at [Fe/H] ∼–2.5

* [A Chandra and ALMA Study of X-ray-irradiated Gas in the Central ~100 pc of the Circinus Galaxy](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.01144)
  * Based on ~200 ksec Chandra/ACIS-S data, we created an image of the Fe Kalpha line at 6.4 keV, tracing X-ray-irradiated dense gas.
  * The molecular gas emission appeared faint in regions with bright iron emission: the molecular gas is efficiently dissociated by AGN X-ray irradiation (i.e., creating an X-ray-dominated region).
  * Furthermore, judging from inactive star formation (SF) reported in the literature, we suggest that the X-ray emission has potential to suppress SF

* [The Fornax 3D project: Thick disks in a cluster environment](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.01260)
  * **Relevant, Interesting**
  * These are both old, relatively metal poor and [Mg/Fe]-enhanced, and their star formation history (SFH) reveals a minor younger component whose chemical properties suggest its later accretion
  * The outer regions of these geometrically defined thick disks show higher values of metallicity and lower values of [Mg/Fe]. These stars probably formed in the thin-disk region and they were dynamically heated to form the flares present in these two galaxies.
  * A clear distinction in age is found between the metal poor and [Mg/Fe]-enhanced thick disks (old, ∼ 12 − 13 Gyr), and the metal rich and less [Mg/Fe]-enhanced thin disks (young, ∼ 4 − 5 Gyr).

* [Multiphase gas flows in the nearby Seyfert galaxy ESO428-G14](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.01483)
  * ALMA观测：We detect CO(2-1) emission from spiral arms and a circum-nuclear ring with 200 pc radius, and from a transverse gas lane with size of ∼ 100 pc, which crosses the nucleus and connects the two portions the circumnuclear ring.
  * In the inner 100 pc region CO is distributed in a equatorial bar, whose kinematics is highly perturbed and consistent with an inflow of gas towards the AGN.
  * CO bar和compton thick的区域重合，CO分子柱密度很高：molecular gas may contribute significantly to the AGN obscuration.
  * 看到了CO分子的外流，在700pc的距离上；The bi-conical outflow is also detected in the H2 emission line at 2.12 μm, which traces a warmer nuclear outflow located within 170 pc from the AGN. This suggests that the outflow cools with increasing distance from the AGN.

* [On the Detection of Supermassive Primordial Stars. II. Blue Supergiants](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.01507)
  * These stars have spectral features that are quite distinct from those of cooler stars and may have different detection limits in the near infrared (NIR) today.
  * We find that photometric detections of these stars by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) will be limited to z≲ 10 - 12, lower redshifts than those at which red stars can be found, because of quenching by their accretion envelopes.
  * With moderate gravitational lensing, Euclid and the Wide-Field Infrared Space Telescope (WFIRST) could detect blue supermassive stars out to similar redshifts in wide-field surveys.

* [Beyond BAO: improving cosmological constraints from BOSS with measurement of the void-galaxy cross-correlations](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.01030)
  * **Interesting**
  * We perform a joint fit to the data for redshift space distortions (RSD) due to galaxy peculiar velocities and anisotropies due to the Alcock-Paczynski (AP) effect
  * Fits to the void-galaxy function give a 1% measurement of the AP parameter combination DA(z)H(z)/c = 0.436 ± 0.005 at redshift z = 0.57, where DA is the angular diameter distance and H the Hubble parameter, exceeding the precision obtainable from baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) by a factor of ∼ 3.5
  * The parameter degeneracies are orthogonal to those obtained from galaxy clustering.

* [Measurements of effective optical depth in the Lyα forest from the BOSS DR12 Quasar sample](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.01110)
  * Measure the effective optical depth in the Lyman-alpha (Lyα) forest using 40,035 quasar from BOSS
  * 看光深的红移演化：Modeling the redshift evolution of the effective optical depth with a power-law, 红移演化的power-law指数在~3左右
  * Finally, using the reconstructed Lyα forest continuum to directly measure the transmitted flux ratio as a function of redshift, we find deviations of less than 2.5% from the predictions from the global model and no convincing evidence for signal associated with He II reionization.

* [Evidence for CII diffuse line emission at redshift z∼2.6](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.01181)
  * Recent work measured the C ii emission line amplitude for redshifts 2 < z < 3.2 by cross-correlating Planck High Frequency Instrument emission maps with tracers of overdensity from the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Sky Survey
  * We present a refinement of this earlier work by improving the mask weighting in each of the Planck bands and the precision in the covariance matrix.
  * 在545 GHz探测到了和CIB不同的信号, 符合红移后的CII线：which strongly favors many collisional excitation models of C ii emission.

* [Imaging the AGN Torus in Cygnus](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.01365)
  * First direct imaging of what may be the thick torus in the active galactic nucleus (AGN) of the archetype powerful radio galaxy Cygnus A, using the Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) at 18 GHz to 48 GHz, with a resolution down to 45 mas.
  * An elongated structure, perpendicular to the radio jets and centered on the core, is well resolved
  * The radio emission spectrum is consistent with optically thin free-free emission.

* [Ionization driven intrinsic absorption line variability of BAL quasars in the Stripe 82 region](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.02149)
  * the connection between the intrinsic C iv absorption line variability and the continuum flux changes of broad absorption line (BAL) quasars using a sample of 78 sources in the Stripe 82 region.
  * We find evidence for weak correlations (ρs ∼ 0.3) between the intrinsic C iv absorption line variability and the quasar continuum variability

* [Detailed dust modelling in the L-Galaxies semi-analytic model of galaxy formation](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.02196)

* [Molecular Gas Properties in the Host Galaxies of GRB080207](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.02196)
  * The host is detected in CO(1-0) and CO(4-3), becoming the first case for a GRB host with more than two CO transitions detected
  * The CO velocity field shows a clear rotation and is reproduced by a rotation-dominated disk model
  * The CO spectral line energy distribution derived from the four CO transitions is similar to that of starburst galaxies, suggesting a high excitation condition.

* [Ultraviolet Signatures of the Multiphase Intracluster and Circumgalactic Media in the RomulusC Simulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.02318)
  * We show that the ICM becomes increasingly multiphased at large radii, with the cool-warm gas becoming dominant in cluster outskirts. The diffuse cool-warm gas also exhibits a wider range of metallicity than the hot X-ray emitting gas.

* [Metallicity and ionization state of the gas in polar-ring galaxies](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.02513)
  * 13个确认的polar disk星系
  * We show that ionization by young stars dominates in the external parts of polar discs, while shocks have a significant contribution to gas excitation in the inner parts of polar structures.
  * The measured values of the gas metallicity almost do not depend on the galaxy luminosity. The radial [O/H] gradient in the considered polar rings is shallow or absent.

* [A Constant LGRB Metallicity Distribution Across Redshifts z < 2.5](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.02673)
  * We then find a curious consistency in the metallicity distribution across different redshifts. This is at odds with the general evolution in the mass metallicity relation of typical galaxies, which become progressively more metal poor with increasing redshift at constant mass
  * The estimated LGRB host metallicity distribution is approximately a quarter dex higher than the measured metallicity distribution at all redshifts.

### Apr 7

* [Spectroscopy of NGC 4258 globular cluster candidates: membership confirmation and kinematics](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.02712)
  * **Relevant**
  * 23个uiK颜色挑选出来的球状星团候选，OSIRIS观测：In the spectroscopy presented here, 70% of the candidates are confirmed as globular clusters.
  * We find that the GCs, mostly metal-poor, co-rotate with the HI disk, even at large galactocentric distances.

* [Evolution of galactic planes of satellites in the EAGLE simulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.02719)
  * EAGLE模拟：we introduce a robust method to identify the subsets of satellites that have the most co-planar orbits.
  * Purely flattened satellite systems are short-lived chance associations and persist for less than 1 Gyr. In contrast, satellite subsets that share roughly the same orbital plane are longer lived, with half of the MW-like systems being at least 4 Gyrs old.
  * On average, satellite systems were flatter in the past, with a minimum in their minor-to-major axes ratio about 9 Gyrs ago, which is the typical infall time of the classical satellites.

* [A Characteristic Mass Scale in the Mass-Metallicity Relation of Galaxies](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.02721)
  * **Interesting**
  * We observe a characteristic stellar mass scale at M∗≃10^9.5M⊙, above which the ISM undergoes a sharp increase in its level of chemical enrichment.
  * At approaching M∗≃10^9.5M⊙ the MZR steepens significantly, showing a slope of α=0.37±0.08 in the 10^9.5−10^10.5M⊙ range, and a flattening towards a constant metallicity at higher stellar masses.
  * High resolution hydrodynamical simulations can qualitatively reproduce our result, and suggest a transition in the ability of galaxies to retain their metals for stellar masses above this threshold.
  * The MZR characteristic mass scale also coincides with a transition in the scale height and clumpiness of cold gas disks, and a typical gas fraction below which the efficiency of star formation feedback for driving outflows is expected to decrease sharply.

* [EDGE I: the mass-metallicity relation as a critical test of galaxy formation physics](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.02723)
  * **Interesting**
  * 模拟研究dwarf：we explore the effects of resolution and sub-grid physics on a single low mass halo
  * On-the-fly辐射转移重要：We show that RT changes the mode of galactic self-regulation at this halo mass, suppressing star formation by causing the interstellar and circumgalactic gas to remain predominantly warm (∼10^4 K) even before cosmic reionisation
  * 能重现各种观测的scaling relation：This is because such structural scaling relations are predominantly set by the host dark matter halo
  * We find that only the stellar mass-metallicity relation differentiates the galaxy formation models. Explosive feedback ejects more metals from the dwarf, leading to a lower metallicity at a fixed stellar mass. 对于dwarf星系，质量-丰度关系很重要

* [A Catalog of the Most Optically Luminous Galaxies at z<0.3: Super Spirals, Super Lenticulars, Super Post-Mergers, and Giant Ellipticals](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.02806)
  * **Relevant, Useful**
  * We present a catalog of the 1525 most optically luminous galaxies from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) with r-band luminosity L_r > 8L* and redshift z<0.3, including 84 super spirals, 15 super lenticulars, 14 super post-merger galaxies, and 1400 giant ellipticals.
  * 这些大质量盘星系很有意思：The specific star formation rates of super spirals place them on or below the star-forming main sequence.
  * Their disks are red on the inside and blue on the outside, consistent with inside-out growth. They tend to have small bulge-to-total (B/T) r-band luminosity ratios, characteristic of disk building via minor mergers and cold accretion.
  * A large percentage of super disk galaxies (41%) have double nuclei, double disks, or other signatures of ongoing mergers. Most (72%) are found in moderate to low density environments, while the rest are found at the outskirts of clusters.

* [Jet Kinematics of the Quasar 4C +21.35 from Observations with the KaVA Very Long Baseline Interferometry Array](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.02894)
  * The timing of the ejection of a new component detected in 2016 is consistent with a gamma-ray flare in November 2014.
  * The discrepancy at 43 GHz indicates that radio arrays with different angular resolution identify and trace different jet features even when the data are obtained at the same frequency and at the same time.

* [Runaway Merger Shocks in Galaxy Cluster Outskirts and Radio Relics](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.03052)
  * 研究星系团并合产生的shock在星系际介质中继续传播的性质：In a uniform medium, such a "runaway" shock should weaken with distance. However, as shocks move to large radii in galaxy clusters, the shock is moving down a steep density gradient that helps the shock to maintain its strength over a large distance.
  * 在R500以外，气体密度轮廓会变陡，适合激波的维持。
  * A characteristic feature of runaway shocks is that the strong compression, relative to the initial state, is confined to a narrow region just behind the shock. This makes these shocks promising candidates for "igniting" radio relics via adiabatic compression of pre-existing populations of relativistic particles.

* [Detection of a double-peaked Hα component from the accretion disc of NGC 4958](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.03095)
  * 双峰Halpha线可以是吸积盘的证据：The narrow line region of this object has an emission that is typical of a LINER galaxy, which is the usual classification for double-peaked emitters.
  * We concluded that the double-peaked emission is emitted by a circular relativistic Keplerian disc

* [Fast Outflows Identified in Early Star-Forming Galaxies at z=5−6](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.03106)
  * 高红移10^10 Msun的恒星形成星系的外流速度测量，用ALMA [CII] 158micron线作为系统速度测量，用Keck观测前景吸收线测量外流 (composite光谱)
  * Fit outflow-line profiles to the SiII1260, CII1335, and SiIV1394,1403 absorption lines in the composite spectrum
  * We find the redshift evolution that the vmax value of our z=5-6 galaxies is higher than those of z=0 galaxies by a factor of 3.5 and comparable to the one of z=2 galaxies.

* [Young stellar populations in early-type dwarf galaxies; occurrence, radial extent and scaling relations](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.03108)
  * **Relevant, Interesting**
  * We compare the slopes and intrinsic scatter of color-magnitude relations (CMRs) for three nearby clusters, Fornax, Virgo and Coma.
  * Based on analysis of the color profiles, we report a large number of dEs with young stellar populations in their center in all three clusters.
  * While for Virgo and Coma the number of blue-cored dEs is found to be 85 +/- 2% and 53 +/- 3% respectively, for Fornax, we find that all galaxies have a blue core.
  * We show that bluer cores reside in fainter dEs, similar to the trend seen in nucleated dEs.
  * Presenting adaptive smoothing we show that the galaxies on the blue side of the CMR often show evidence for dust extinction, which strengthens the interpretation that the bluer colors are due to young stellar populations.
  * We also find that outliers on the red side of the CMR are more compact than expected for their luminosity. We find several of these red outliers in Virgo, often close to more massive galaxies.

* [Milky Way and Andromeda past-encounters in different gravity models: the impact on the estimated Local Group mass](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.03153)
  * 看M31和MW有没有之前的相遇：it is shown that if M31 and the MW had more than one encounter then the mass of the Local Group (LG) would be a few times higher than if there had been no encounters. Past encounters are possible only for non-zero transverse velocity, and their viability is subject to observations of the imprints of such near collisions.

* [Radio Galaxy Zoo: Knowledge Transfer Using Rotationally Invariant Self-Organising Maps](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.02876)
  * Here we discuss the challenges of transferring crowdsourced labels obtained from the Radio Galaxy Zoo project and introduce a proper transfer mechanism via quantile random forest regression.
  * By using parallelized rotation and flipping invariant Kohonen-maps, image cubes of Radio Galaxy Zoo selected galaxies formed from the FIRST radio continuum and WISE infrared all sky surveys are first projected down to a two-dimensional embedding in an unsupervised way.
  * In the second step, images are compared with those prototypes to create a heat-map, which is the morphological fingerprint of each object and the basis for transferring the user generated labels.
  * These heat-maps have reduced the feature space by a factor of 248 and are able to be used as the basis for subsequent ML methods.

### Apr 8

* [Observing AGN feedback with CO intensity mapping](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.03197)
  * Upcoming CO intensity mapping experiments offer an opportunity for a less biased probe of quasar feedback. By correlating intensity maps with spectroscopic AGN surveys, we can obtain a measurement of the mean CO luminosity of a large population of quasars simultaneously.
  * We show that experiments like COMAP, CCAT-prime, and CONCERTO have enough sensitivity to detect this cross-correlation if existing AGN observations are representative of the whole population

* [The Sloan Digital Sky Survey Reverberation Mapping Project: Initial CIV Lag Results from Four Years of Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.03199)
  * reverberation-mapping lags and black-hole mass measurements using the CIV 1549 broad emission line from a sample of 349 quasars
  * We report significant time delays between the continuum and the CIV 1549 emission line in 52 quasars, with an estimated false-positive detection rate of 10%.
  * 如果观测时间更长，还有更多的delay相关可以被观测到
  * Our results significantly increase the sample of quasars with CIV RM results, with the quasars spanning two orders of magnitude in luminosity toward the high-luminosity end of the CIV radius-luminosity relation.

* [Radiation pattern and outflow geometry: a new probe of black hole spin?](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.03203)
  * The BH spin determines the radiation pattern from the accretion disc, which directly imprints on the geometry of the radiation-driven outflows.
  * 黑洞自旋低的时候，辐射更多是polar的；自旋高的时候，更倾向于各向同
  * 也可以反向利用外流性质来看黑洞自旋

* [Supermassive black holes with high accretion rates in active galactic nuclei: X. Optical variability characteristics](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.03393)
  * 73个AGN的RM监测，是SEAMBHS的一部分：We employed the damped random walk (DRW) model to delineate the optical variability of continuum at 5100~\AA~and obtained damped variability timescale (τd) and amplitude (σd)
  * AGN光变特征和黑洞质量，吸积率，连续谱光度有相关；These correlations are smooth from sub-Eddington to super-Eddington accretion AGNs, probably implying that the AGN variability may be caused by the same physical mechanism.

* [Torus model properties of an ultra-hard X-ray selected sample of Seyfert galaxies](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.03694)
  * In the case of the Sy1s we estimate the accretion disk contribution to the subarcsecond resolution nuclear IR SEDs (~0.4'') which is, on average, 46+-28, 23+-13 and 11+-5% in the J-, H- and K-bands
  * 那些假定吸积盘辐射贡献过了近红外端就锐减的模型可能会低估torus的红外贡献
  * We confirm that Sy2s have larger values of the torus covering factor (CT~0.95) than Sy1s (CT~0.65) in our volume-limited Seyfert sample.
  * 覆盖参数不随AGN光度和吸积率有太大变化
  * Even an ultra hard X-ray selection is missing a significant fraction of highly absorbed type 2 sources with very high covering factor tori.

* [Piercing Through Highly Obscured and Compton-thick AGNs in the Chandra Deep Fields: I. X-ray Spectral and Long-term Variability Analyses](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.03827)
  * CDFS里面的AGN X-ray光谱分析，找高度遮挡的：We propose a new hardness-ratio measure of the obscuration level which can be used to select highly obscured AGN
  * The observed logN-logS relation favors cosmic X-ray background models that predict moderate (i.e., between optimistic and pessimistic) CT number counts.
  * 部分X-ray遮挡是视线效应
  * After correcting for several observational biases, we obtain the intrinsic NH distribution and its evolution. The CT-to-highly-obscured fraction is roughly 52% and is consistent with no evident redshift evolution.

* [Polarization of changing-look quasars](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.03914)
  * 如果宽线区消失来自尘埃遮挡，应该可以观测到高线偏振度的光学辐射: measured the rest-frame UV-blue linear polarization of a sample of 13 changing-look quasars
  * For all quasars but one the polarization degree is lower than 1% 所以应该不是尘埃导致的
  * Characterizing the local relation between star formation rate and gas-phase metallicity in MaNGA spiral galaxies

* [Characterizing the local relation between star formation rate and gas-phase metallicity in MaNGA spiral galaxies](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.03930)
  * We have characterized the local relation between SFR and Zg after subtracting the azimuthally averaged radial profiles of both quantities. 60% of the analyzed galaxies display a SFR−Zg anti-correlation, with the remaining 40% showing no correlation (19%) or positive correlation (21%).
  * Thus, the local SFR−Zg slope varies with the average metallicity, with the more metal-poor galaxies presenting the lowest slopes (i.e., the strongest SFR−Zg anti-correlations)
  * Our results suggest that external gas accretion fuels star-formation in metal-poor galaxies, whereas in metal-rich systems the gas comes from previous star formation episodes.

* [Stellar 3-D kinematics in the Draco dwarf spheroidal galaxy](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.03930)
  * Altogether this resulted in a final sample of 45 members of Draco with high-precision and accurate 3D motion
  * Our Jeans modelling supports the case for a cuspy dark matter profile in this galaxy.

* [Inner and outer rings are not strongly coupled with stellar bars](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.04222)
  * **Interesting**
  * S4G里面正向盘星系：The ring fraction increases with bar Fourier density amplitude: this can be interpreted as evidence for the role of bars in ring formation.
  * The sizes of inner rings are positively correlated with bar strength: this can be linked to the radial displacement of the 1/4 ultra-harmonic resonance while the bar grows and the pattern speed decreases.
  * i) approximately ∼1/3 and ∼1/4 of the non-barred galaxies in the S4G host inner and outer rings, respectively;
  * ii) on average, the sizes and shapes of rings are roughly the same for barred and non-barred galaxies;
  * iii) the fraction of inner (outer) rings is a factor of 1.2−1.4 (1.65−1.9) larger in barred galaxies than in their non-barred counterparts.
  * We confirm, with the aid of SOMs, that rings are mainly hosted by red, massive, gas-deficient, dark-matter poor, and centrally concentrated galaxies.
  * 环和棒的联系似乎不如模拟里预测的那么明显

* [Baryon acoustic oscillations at z = 2.34 from the correlations of Lyα absorption in eBOSS DR14](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.03400)
  * We measure the imprint of primordial baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) in the correlation function of Lyα absorption in quasar spectra from BOSS and eBOSS
  * We measure the Hubble distance, DH, and the comoving angular diameter distance, DM, relative to the sound horizon at the drag epoch rd at an effective redshift z=2.34
  * With the addition of polynomial "broadband" terms, the results remain within one standard deviation of the CMB-inspired model.

* [Baryon acoustic oscillations from the cross-correlation of Lyα absorption and quasars in eBOSS DR14](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.03430)
  * From the measured BAO peak position along and across the line of sight, we determine the Hubble distance DH and the comoving angular diameter distance DM relative to the sound horizon at the drag epoch rd
  * These results are consistent at 1.5σ with the prediction of the best-fit flat ΛCDM cosmological model

* [Improved supervised learning methods for EoR parameters reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.04106)
  * 如何从未来的21cm mapping数据里限制EoR模型：We build on these by improving the accuracy of the predictions using neural network and exploring other supervised learning methods: the kernel and ridge regressions
  * This last performance level requires optimizing the hyper-parameters of the method: how to do that perfectly in the case of an unknown signal remains an open question
