* [Measuring Star-Formation Histories, Distances, and Metallicities with Pixel Color-Magnitude Diagrams I: Model Definition and Mock Tests](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.00011)
  * **Interesting, Useful**
  * Here we present Pixel Color-Magnitude Diagrams with Python (pcmdpy), a GPU-accelerated package that makes significant computational improvements to the original code and including more realistic physical models.
  * These advances include the simultaneous fitting of distance, modeling a Gaussian metallicity-distribution function, and an observationally-motivated dust model.
  * Our results suggest the code, applied to observations with HST-like resolution, should constrain these properties with high precision within 10 Mpc and can be applied to systems out to as far as 100 Mpc.

* [The evolution of the quenching of star formation in cluster galaxies since z ∼ 1](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.00011)
  * **Relevant**
  * 看HSC数据中209 IR-selected galaxy clusters at 0.3≤z≤1.1 in the ELAIS-N1 and XMM-LSS fields的恒星形成星系
  * Using R/R200 to trace environment, we observe a decrease in fSF from the field towards the cluster core, which strongly depends on stellar mass and redshift.
  * Finally, we find that environmental and mass quenching efficiencies depend on galaxy stellar mass and distance to the center of the cluster, demonstrating that the two effects are not separable in the cluster environment.

* [Major mergers are not the dominant trigger for high-accretion AGNs at z = 2](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.00037)
  * We examine 21 galaxies hosting a high accreting black hole (L/Ledd > 0.7) observed with HST/WFC3 and 92 stellar mass- and redshift- matched inactive galaxies taken from the CANDELS survey.
  * 把AGN贡献扣除后，打乱再分类：The resulting samples were joined, randomized, and subsequently visually ranked with respect to perceived strength of structural distortions by 10 experts.
  * With the merger fractions fm,agn = 0.24 ± 0.09 for the AGN host galaxy sample and fm,ina = 0.19 ± 0.04 for the inactive galaxies, we find no significant difference between the AGN host galaxies and inactive galaxies

* [The Extended Disk Galaxy Exploration Science Survey: Description and Surface Brightness Profile Properties](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.00050)
  * **Relevant, Interesting**
  * EDGES is a Spitzer Space Telescope Warm Mission program designed to reach the surface brightness limit (∼0.5 kJy sr−1 or 29 AB mag arcsec−2) of the Infrared Array Camera (IRAC) 3.6 and 4.5 μm bands for a wide range of galaxy types found within the local volume.
  * The surface brightness profiles exhibit a large range in disc scalelength, with breaks more frequently seen than in previous studies, owing in large part to the extremely deep near-infrared imaging.
  * A number of these surface brightness profile breaks may be due to stellar halos, up to 7 galaxies out of the full sample of 92 galaxies

* [The molecular-gas properties in the gravitationally lensed merger HATLAS J142935.3-002836](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.00307)
  * New APEX observations targeting two carbon monoxide (CO) rotational transitions J_up=3 and 6.
  * We show that the line-profiles comprise three distinct velocity components, where the fainter high-velocity one is less magnified and more compact.
  * The detected gas and dust emission comes exclusively from only one of the two merging components

* [Giant radio galaxies in the LOFAR Two-metre Sky Survey-I](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.00409)
  * **Interesting**
  * GRGs are much rarer than normal sized radio galaxies ( less than 0.7 Mpc) and the reason for their gigantic sizes is still debated
  * 本文展示了从LFAR LoTSS中得到的最大的巨射电星系样本： Of the 240 GRGs found, 228 are new discoveries. The GRGs have sizes ranging from 0.7 to 3.5 Mpc and have redshifts between 0.1 and 2.3. Seven GRGs have sizes above 2 Mpc and one has a size of ~ 3.5 Mpc.
  * We also find that 21 GRGs are located in dense galaxy cluster/group environments, which were identified using optical data.
  * 射电谱指数和普通的射点星系差别不大

* [The time delay between star formation quenching and morphological transformation of galaxies in clusters: a phase-space view of EDisCS](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.00466)
  * Explore the possible effect of cluster environments on the structure and star formation histories of galaxies by analysing the projected phase-space (PPS) of intermediate-redshift cluster (0.4<z<0.8).
  * we establish that in all environments younger star-forming galaxies of all morphologies are 'rougher' (REF高) and more asymmetric than older, more quiescent ones.
  * Find a significant correlation between the position of the galaxies on the PPS and their stellar ages, irrespective of their morphology.
    * These results may imply that, transformation happens on a longer timescale as they accumulate and age in the cluster cores.

* [Galaxies and Supermassive Black Holes at z <= 0.1: The Velocity Dispersion Function](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.00486)
  * **Important, Relevant**
  * SDSS星系的VDF研究：We compare two different sigma estimates; one based on SDSS spectroscopy (sigma_spec) and another on photometric estimates (sigma_mod).
  * The VDFs measured from these quantities are remarkably similar for lower sigma values, but the sigma_mod VDF falls faster than the sigma_spec VDF at log sigma > 2.35
  * Very few galaxies are observed to have sigma > 350 km/s.
  * We also find that both late and early type galaxies have sigma_spec > sigma_mod, suggesting that the rotation component of most galaxies figure significantly into sigma_spec measurements.

* [Extended star-forming region within galaxies in a dense proto-cluster core at z=2.53](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.00695)
  * We conducted the Adaptive Optics(AO)-assisted imaging observations for star-forming galaxies in a dense proto-cluster core at z=2.53 with IRCS and AO188 mounted on the Subaru Telescope.
  * Resolved maps of Hα-emitting regions with an angular resolution of 0.1--0.2~arcsec, which corresponds to ∼1 kpc at z∼2.5.
  * We compare radial profiles of star-forming regions and stellar components and find that the star-forming region of a sub-sample with log(M∗/M⊙)∼10−11 is more extended than the stellar component, indicating the inside-out growth of the structure.
  * 和非proto-cluster环境的差不多

* [Measurement of the Extragalactic Background Light using MAGIC and Fermi-LAT gamma-ray observations of blazars up to z = 1](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.00134)
  * **Study**
  * Extragalactic background light (EBL) based on a joint likelihood analysis of 32 gamma-ray spectra for 12 blazars in the redshift range z = 0.03 to 0.944
  * The EBL can be studied indirectly through its effect on very-high energy photons that are emitted by cosmic sources and absorbed via photon-photon interactions during their propagation across cosmological distances. We obtain estimates of the EBL density in good agreement with state-of-the-art models of the EBL production and evolution.
  * No anomaly in the expected transparency of the universe to gamma rays is observed in any range of optical depth.
  * We also perform a wavelength-resolved EBL determination, which results in a hint of an excess of EBL in the 0.18 - 0.62 μm range relative to the studied models, yet compatible with them within systematics.

* [Satellites of Satellites: The Case for Carina and Fornax](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.01028)
  * 模拟: For galaxies as luminous as the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC), and for halos as massive as expected for the LMC (determined by its rotation speed), the simulations predict about ∼3 satellites with stellar masses exceeding M∗ > 10^5 M⊙
  * The new proper motions of the Fornax and Carina dwarf spheroidals place them on orbits closely aligned with the orbital plane of the Magellanic Clouds, hinting at a potential Magellanic association. Together with the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC), this result raises to 3 the number of LMC satellites
  * This also fills the 12-mag luminosity gap between the SMC and the ultra-faints Hyi1, Car2, Hor1, and Car3

* [A metal-poor ultra compact dwarf galaxy at a kiloparsec distance from the low-mass elliptical galaxy FCC47](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.01041)
  * **Relevant, Interesting**
  * We aim to characterise the properties of a UCD found at very close projected distance (rproj = 1.1 kpc) from the centre of the low-mass (M ∼ 10^10 M⊙) early-type galaxy FCC 47
  * FCC 47-UCD1’s surface brightness is best described by a single King profile with low concentration C = Rt /Rc ∼ 10 and large effective radius (reff = 24 pc).
  * Its integrated magnitude and a blue colour (Mg = −10.55 mag, (g − z) = 1.46 mag) combined with with a metallicity of [M/H] = −1.12 ± 0.10 dex and an age > 8 Gyr
  * we can only give an upper limit on the velocity dispersion (σ < 17 km s−1)
  * The low metallicity, old age and magnitude are consistent with a star cluster origin, whereas the extended size and high mass are consistent with an origin as the stripped nucleus of a dwarf galaxy with a initial stellar mass of a few 10^8 M⊙ .

* [The abundance and physical properties of O VII and O VIII X-ray absorption systems in the EAGLE simulations](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.01057)
  * 用EAGLE模拟：predict the column density and equivalent width distributions of intergalactic Ovii (E = 574eV) and O viii (E = 654 eV) absorbers at low redshift.
  * We find that their column density distributions evolve little at observable column densities from redshift 1 to 0, and that they are sensitive to AGN feedback (AGN feedback大幅度减少strong absorber的数量)
  * Absorption systems with N>10^16 cm−2 are dominated by collisionally ionized O vii and O viii, while the ionization state of oxygen at lower column densities is also influenced by photoionization
  * 在高柱密度的时候，不能简单的用OVII和OVIII的比值来估计温度

* [An old, metal-poor globular cluster in Sextans A and the metallicity floor of globular cluster systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.01084)
  * **Relevant**
  * We measure an integrated magnitude V = 18.04, corresponding to an absolute magnitude, MV,0 = −7.85. This gives an inferred mass M ∼1.6×10^5 M⊙
  * Stellar population analyses from the upper giant branch of the cluster, and its integrated optical spectrum, suggests a metallicity [Fe/H] ∼–2.4, and an age ∼ 9 Gyr.
  * We compile a sample of 1,928 GCs in 28 galaxies with spectroscopic metallicities and find that the low metallicity of Sextans A-GC1 is close to a ”metallicity floor” at [Fe/H] ∼–2.5

* [A Chandra and ALMA Study of X-ray-irradiated Gas in the Central ~100 pc of the Circinus Galaxy](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.01144)
  * Based on ~200 ksec Chandra/ACIS-S data, we created an image of the Fe Kalpha line at 6.4 keV, tracing X-ray-irradiated dense gas.
  * The molecular gas emission appeared faint in regions with bright iron emission: the molecular gas is efficiently dissociated by AGN X-ray irradiation (i.e., creating an X-ray-dominated region).
  * Furthermore, judging from inactive star formation (SF) reported in the literature, we suggest that the X-ray emission has potential to suppress SF

* [The Fornax 3D project: Thick disks in a cluster environment](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.01260)
  * **Relevant, Interesting**
  * These are both old, relatively metal poor and [Mg/Fe]-enhanced, and their star formation history (SFH) reveals a minor younger component whose chemical properties suggest its later accretion
  * The outer regions of these geometrically defined thick disks show higher values of metallicity and lower values of [Mg/Fe]. These stars probably formed in the thin-disk region and they were dynamically heated to form the flares present in these two galaxies.
  * A clear distinction in age is found between the metal poor and [Mg/Fe]-enhanced thick disks (old, ∼ 12 − 13 Gyr), and the metal rich and less [Mg/Fe]-enhanced thin disks (young, ∼ 4 − 5 Gyr).

* [Multiphase gas flows in the nearby Seyfert galaxy ESO428-G14](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.01483)
  * ALMA观测：We detect CO(2-1) emission from spiral arms and a circum-nuclear ring with 200 pc radius, and from a transverse gas lane with size of ∼ 100 pc, which crosses the nucleus and connects the two portions the circumnuclear ring. 
  * In the inner 100 pc region CO is distributed in a equatorial bar, whose kinematics is highly perturbed and consistent with an inflow of gas towards the AGN. 
  * CO bar和compton thick的区域重合，CO分子柱密度很高：molecular gas may contribute significantly to the AGN obscuration.
  * 看到了CO分子的外流，在700pc的距离上；The bi-conical outflow is also detected in the H2 emission line at 2.12 μm, which traces a warmer nuclear outflow located within 170 pc from the AGN. This suggests that the outflow cools with increasing distance from the AGN.

* [On the Detection of Supermassive Primordial Stars. II. Blue Supergiants](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.01507)
  * These stars have spectral features that are quite distinct from those of cooler stars and may have different detection limits in the near infrared (NIR) today.
  * We find that photometric detections of these stars by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) will be limited to z≲ 10 - 12, lower redshifts than those at which red stars can be found, because of quenching by their accretion envelopes.
  * With moderate gravitational lensing, Euclid and the Wide-Field Infrared Space Telescope (WFIRST) could detect blue supermassive stars out to similar redshifts in wide-field surveys.

* [Beyond BAO: improving cosmological constraints from BOSS with measurement of the void-galaxy cross-correlations](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.01030)
  * **Interesting**
  * We perform a joint fit to the data for redshift space distortions (RSD) due to galaxy peculiar velocities and anisotropies due to the Alcock-Paczynski (AP) effect
  * Fits to the void-galaxy function give a 1% measurement of the AP parameter combination DA(z)H(z)/c = 0.436 ± 0.005 at redshift z = 0.57, where DA is the angular diameter distance and H the Hubble parameter, exceeding the precision obtainable from baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) by a factor of ∼ 3.5
  * The parameter degeneracies are orthogonal to those obtained from galaxy clustering.

* [Measurements of effective optical depth in the Lyα forest from the BOSS DR12 Quasar sample](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.01110)
  * Measure the effective optical depth in the Lyman-alpha (Lyα) forest using 40,035 quasar from BOSS
  * 看光深的红移演化：Modeling the redshift evolution of the effective optical depth with a power-law, 红移演化的power-law指数在~3左右
  * Finally, using the reconstructed Lyα forest continuum to directly measure the transmitted flux ratio as a function of redshift, we find deviations of less than 2.5% from the predictions from the global model and no convincing evidence for signal associated with He II reionization.

* [Evidence for CII diffuse line emission at redshift z∼2.6](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.01181)
  * Recent work measured the C ii emission line amplitude for redshifts 2 < z < 3.2 by cross-correlating Planck High Frequency Instrument emission maps with tracers of overdensity from the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Sky Survey
  * We present a refinement of this earlier work by improving the mask weighting in each of the Planck bands and the precision in the covariance matrix.
  * 在545 GHz探测到了和CIB不同的信号, 符合红移后的CII线：which strongly favors many collisional excitation models of C ii emission.

* [Imaging the AGN Torus in Cygnus](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.01365)
  * First direct imaging of what may be the thick torus in the active galactic nucleus (AGN) of the archetype powerful radio galaxy Cygnus A, using the Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) at 18 GHz to 48 GHz, with a resolution down to 45 mas.
  * An elongated structure, perpendicular to the radio jets and centered on the core, is well resolved
  * The radio emission spectrum is consistent with optically thin free-free emission.
