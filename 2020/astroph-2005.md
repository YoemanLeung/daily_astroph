- [A hydrodynamical halo model for weak-lensing cross correlations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.00009)
  - **Relevant** 关于baryonic effect
  - We develop a cosmology-dependent model for the matter distribution that simultaneously accounts for the clustering of dark matter, gas and stars.
  - We present two variants; one that matches the feedback-induced suppression seen in the matter-matter power spectrum at the per-cent level and a second that matches the matter-matter data slightly less well (~2 per cent), but that is able to simultaneously model the matter-electron pressure spectrum at the ~15 per-cent level.
  - 将tSZ观测和lensing correlation测量功率谱结合起来

- [Euclid: The importance of galaxy clustering and weak lensing cross-correlations within the photometric Euclid survey](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.00055)
  - **csst, ssst**
  - We aim at understanding the amount of additional information that cross-correlation can provide for parameters encoding systematic effects, such as galaxy bias or intrinsic alignments (IA).
  - We show that XC improves the dark energy Figure of Merit (FoM) by a factor ∼5, whilst it also reduces the uncertainties on galaxy bias by ∼17% and the uncertainties on IA by a factor ∼4.
  - We also show that XC can help in distinguishing between different IA models, and that if IA terms are neglected then this can lead to significant biases on the cosmological parameters.

- [Star formation and morphological properties of galaxies in the Pan-STARRS 3π survey- I. A machine learning approach to galaxy and supernova classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.00155)
  - We train and test two Random Forest (RF) classifiers using photometric features (colors and moments)
  - 给出每个星系是High SF星系和是旋涡星系的概率：We show that by selecting on PHSFF or Pspiral it is possible to significantly enhance or suppress the fraction of core-collapse SNe (or thermonuclear SNe) in the sample with respect to random guessing.

- [The Fornax Deep Survey with VST. VIII. Connecting the accretion history with the cluster density](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.00025)
  - **Relevant**
  - 19个明亮的ETG：We performed multi-component fits to the azimuthally averaged surface brightness profiles available for all sample galaxies.
  - We find that in the most massive and reddest ETGs the fraction of light in, probably accreted, halos is much larger than in the other galaxies.
  - Inside the virial radius of the cluster, the total luminosity of the intra-cluster light, compared with the total luminosity of all cluster members, is about 34%.

- [Flat Rotation Curves of z∼1 Star-Forming Galaxies and Evidence of Disk-Scale Length Evolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.00279)
  - **Interesting**
  - K-band Multi-Object Spectrograph (KMOS) for Redshift One Spectroscopic Survey (KROSS): 409个0.6< z <1.0的SF星系，平均恒星质量10^10Msun
  - 3DBarolo方法提取Halpha旋转曲线：考虑beam smearing effect和压力梯度效应 (ADC方法)
  - Nearly all objects (0.1< v/σ <15) are affected by the pressure gradient, and we noticed that ADC improves the rotation velocity of these systems by ∼10−87%.  
  - We do not see any change in the shape of RCs with respect to the local star-forming disk-type galaxies. In contrast, we do find a significant evolution in the stellar-disk length (RD) of the galaxies. 

- [Galaxy Merger Rates up to z ∼ 3 using a Bayesian Deep Learning Model − A Major-Merger classifier using IllustrisTNG Simulation data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.00476)
  - We classify major mergers and measure galaxy merger rates up to z ∼ 3 in all five CANDELS fields (UDS, EGS, GOODS-S, GOODS-N, COSMOS) using deep learning convolutional neural networks (CNNs) trained with simulated galaxies from the IllustrisTNG cosmological simulation. 
  - We finish by demonstrating that our model is capable of measuring galaxy merger rates, that are consistent with results found for CANDELS galaxies using close pairs statistics, with R(z)=0.02±0.004×(1+z)^2.76±0.21.
