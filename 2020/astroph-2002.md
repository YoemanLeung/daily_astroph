  - The spectroscopic temperature and mass estimate are biased low by cooler gas dominating the emission, due to its quadratic density dependence.

- [High Resolution Spectral Line Indices Useful for the Analysis of Stellar Populations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.11521)
  - Here we show that using at least two new spectral line indices defined and measured on high-resolution (R= 6000) spectra of a signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) ≥ 10 one gets unambiguous estimates of the age and metallicity of intermediate to old stellar populations

- [Dynamical heating of the X-ray emitting intracluster medium: the roles of merger shocks and turbulence dissipation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.00674)
  - 讨论 the dissipation of intracluster turbulent motions 对加热ICM的重要性，利用高分辨和多时间帧模拟可以看到the dominant role of merger events in heating the ICM.
  - Turbulence heating, rather than direct heating at merger shocks, dominates the temperature increase of the ICM especially at inner radii r< r500c
  - We find that many merger shocks can propagate with almost constant velocity to very large radii r≫r500c, some even reach and join with the accretion shock

### Feb 4

- [On the global alignments of parsec-scale AGN radio jets and their polarization planes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.00982)

  - We obtained a sample of 10 quasars at z ∼ 2 − 7 in which line emission is detected with high SNR (> 5 − 10) and the gas kinematics is spatially resolved and dominated by ordered rotation
  - The estimated dynamical masses place 6 out of 10 quasars above the local relation yielding to a MBH/Mdyn ratios ∼ 10× higher than those estimated in low-z galaxies.

- [Galaxy mergers in EAGLE do not induce a significant amount of black hole growth yet do increase the rate of luminous AGN](https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.00959)
  - **Interesting**
  - The greatest excess of AGN triggered via a merger are found in lower mass, gas rich, central galaxies with low mas BHs at low redshift.
  - We find no enhancement of AGN triggered via mergers in >10^11 Msun galaxies
  - Major和minor mergers都不是导致黑洞质量增长的主要原因：Whilst at all redshifts the galaxies experiencing a merger have accretion rates that are on average 2–3 times that of isolated galaxies, the majority of mass that is accreted onto BHs occurs outside the periods of a merger.

- [The ALPINE-ALMA [CII] Survey: On the nature of an extremely obscured serendipitous galaxy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.00961)

  - We found that the Xray structure is, in fact, a giant cavity in the X-ray gas filled with diffuse radio emission with an extraordinarily steep radio spectrum 应该是一个很老的AGN活动的遗骸
  - The AGN is currently starved of accreting cool gas because the gas density peak is displaced by core sloshing

- [Stellar Population Properties of ETGs in Compact Groups of Galaxies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.01529)
  - We find that the dependences of mean stellar ages, [Z/H] and [α/Fe] on central stellar velocity dispersion are similar, regardless where the ETG resides,
  - We find that ETGs in GCs behave similarly to centrals, especially those embedded in low-mass haloes
  - GC的group速度弥散度分布似乎是bimodel的，高速度弥散的那些spiral比例更低
  - Our findings point to a small environmental impact on galaxies located in CGs. The only evidence we find is the change in gas content, suggesting environmentally-driven gas loss

- [Calibration of the Tip of the Red Giant Branch (TRGB)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.01529)
  - VIJHK absolute calibration of the TRGB based on observations of TRGB stars in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC),grounded on detached eclipsing binaries (DEBs).
  - Using our revised (and direct) measurement of the LMC TRGB extinction, we find a value of H0 = 69.6 ± 0.8 (±1.1% stat) ± 1.7 (2.4% sys) km s−1 Mpc−1.

  - Proximity zones are regions of enhanced transmitted flux in the vicinity of the quasars that are sensitive to the quasars’ lifetimes because the intergalactic gas has a finite response time to their radiation
  - Combined with previous results we estimate the fraction of young objects within the high–redshift quasar population at large to be 5% < fyoung < 9%.

### Feb 6

- [Scatter in Sunyaev--Zel'dovich effect scaling relations explained by inter-cluster variance in mass accretion histories](https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.01934)
  - We use a simple analytical model to compute the mass assembly-driven non-thermal pressure profiles of individual haloes based on Monte Carlo-generated halo assembly histories from extended Press–Schechter theory
  - The intrinsic scatter in the Sunyaev–Zel’dovich effect observable-mass scaling relation (YSZ − M) due solely to inter-cluster variations in halo mass assembly histories
  - M-YSZ关系在z=0有5-9%的scatter；越往高红移走，越偏离self similar，弥散也会增加

- [Constraining the Mass of the Emerging Galaxy Cluster SpARCS1049+56 at z= 1.71 with Infrared Weak Lensing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.01956)
  - IR weak lensing:  the mass distribution of this young galaxy cluster is mapped and the convergence peak is detected at a 3.3σ level.
  - 3.5x10^14 Msun质量; consistent with the mass derived from a mass-richness scaling relation
  - This mass is extreme for a cluster at such a high redshift and suggests that SpARCS1049+56 is rare in the standard ΛCDM universe

- [Advection by large-scale spiral flows in galaxy clusters](https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.01939)

- [Measuring black hole masses from tidal disruption events: Testing the MBH−σ∗ relation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.02267)
  - An elliptical accretion disk model for tidal disruption events
  - We calculate the radiation efficiency of the elliptical accretion disk and investigate the implications for the observations of TDE
  - Observations are well consistent with the expectations and that the majority of the orbital energy of the stellar debris is advected onto the black hole (BH) without being converted into radiation
  - 能够用来估计黑洞质量，和MBH-sigma估计的一致

- [Dust entrainment in galactic winds](https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.01933)
  - 超新星驱动的风中会有渗入的中性气体和分子气体，以及尘埃，会给CGM增丰：This ejected dust encodes information about the integrated star formation and outflow history of the galaxy
  - Stellar feedback is efficient in driving dust-enriched winds and eject enough material to account for the amount of extraplanar dust observed in nearby galaxies.
  - Moreover, the outflowing cold-dense gas is significantly more dust-enriched than the volume filling hot tenuous material

- [A robust two-parameter description of the stellar profile of elliptical galaxies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.01940)
  - **Relevant**
  - I propose to use the stellar mass enclosed within 10 kpc in projection, M∗,10, and the mass-weighted stellar density slope within the same aperture, Γ∗,10
  - 对一组SDSS/GAMA星系的HSC图像进行测量，在给定的M10和Gamma10上看profile的变化；并合模拟比较
  - The pair of values of (M∗,10, Γ∗,10) can be used to predict the stellar density profile in the inner 10 kpc of a galaxy with better than 20% accuracy

- [Evolution of the grain size distribution in galactic discs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.01945)
  - 大小颗粒尘埃比例：The DS /DL ratio as a function of the galactocentric distance and metallicity is directly compared to what is predicted by the SPH simulations.

- [Luminous Lyman-alpha Emitters with Very Blue UV-continuum Slopes at Redshift 5.7 <= z <= 6.6](https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.02028)
  - We find that their UV-continuum slopes β are in a range of −3.4 ≤ β ≤ −2.6
  - β ≃ −2.6±0.2 galaxies can be well fitted with young and dust-free stellar populations; 更蓝的LAE就不好拟合了
  - 其他的解释： Larger fesc values and very low metallicities are not favored by the strong nebular line emission; combination of a very young population with a high fesc (≥ 0.5) and an old, dusty population

- [Diffuse Lyman-alpha Halos around ~300 Spectroscopically Confirmed Lyman-alpha Emitters at z ~ 5.7](https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.02029)
  - Stacking分析：By comparing the stacked objects with their corresponding point spread functions, we clearly detect extended LAHs around these LAEs.
  - The scale lengths of the LAHs, when described by a double-component model, range from 1.2 to 5.3 kpc with a typical value of ∼2 kpc.
  - We also find that LAEs with higher Lyman-alpha luminosities, higher UV continuum luminosities or smaller Lyman-alpha equivalent widths tend to have larger LAH sizes.
  - Our results are consistent with a scenario that LAHs originate from the scattered light of the central galaxies by H I gas in the circumgalactic medium.

- [Determining the Co-Rotation Radii of Spiral Galaxies Using Spiral Arm Pitch Angle Measurements at Multiple Wavelengths](https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.02307)
  - Density wave theory predicts that spiral arms observed from different wavelengths show a phase crossing at the co-rotation radius.
  - We then found rotation curve data for six of our galaxies and used our co-rotation radii estimates to measure the time that would elapse between star formation and moving to their observed positions in the B-band spirals. The average time lapse for this motion was found to be ∼ 50 Myr.

- [The OTELO survey. II. The faint-end of the Hα luminosity function at z ∼ 0.40](https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.02449)
  - The Hα luminosity function at z∼0.40 is obtained, which extends the current faint end by almost 1 dex
  - We find that no AGN should be expected below a luminosity of log10L=38.6 erg s
  - From the sample of non-AGN (presumably, pure SFG) at z∼0.40 we estimated a star formation rate density of ρSFR=0.012±0.005 M⊙ yr−1 Mpc−3.

### feb 9

- [the structure of tidal disruption event host galaxies on scales of tens to thousands of parsecs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.02498)
  - The TDE hosts do not show the large, kpc-scale tidal disruptions seen in some post-starburst galaxies; the hosts have low morphological asymmetries similar to those of early type galaxies.
  - The TDE hosts have low central (<140 pc) ellipticities compared to early type galaxies.
  - The high central stellar densities are a more important driver than SMBHBs or radial anisotropies in increasing the TDE rate in galaxies with recent starbursts.

- [Spatially-resolved UV diagnostics of AGN feedback: radiation pressure dominates in a prototypical quasar-driven superwind](https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.02454)
  - 紫外高电离发射线可以帮助诊断Feedback的具体机制，区分radiation pressure加速的冷气体或者是有ISM渗入的热外流；sensitive to expected compression of the ISM clouds by the hot wind
  - First spatially resolved UV emission spectroscopy of a prototypical (radio-quiet) quasar-driven superwind around the obscured quasar SDSSJ1356+1026
  - 从100pc到10 kpc，OVI/CIV, NV/CIV, and CIV/HeII都很类似：Such similarity is expected for clouds with AGN radiation pressure dominated dynamics
  - AGN superwind is driven by radiation pressure or was driven by a hot wind that has since dissipated despite on-going AGN activity.

- [Cosmic-Ray Driven Outflows to Mpc Scales from L∗ Galaxies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.02462)
  - **Interesting**
  - We showed previously that massive (Mhalo≳10^11M⊙), low-redshift (z≲1−2) halos can have CR pressure dominate over thermal CGM pressure and balance gravity, giving rise to a cooler CGM with an equilibrium density profile.
  - Absent CRs, high gas thermal pressure in massive halos "traps" galactic outflows near the disk, so they recycle. With CRs injected in supernovae as modeled here, the low-pressure halo allows "escape" and CR pressure gradients continuously accelerate this material well into the IGM in "fast" outflows, while lower-density gas at large radii is accelerated in-situ into "slow" outflows that extend to >Mpc scales.
  - 在低halo质量和高红移处，CR的重要性下降

- [Long-term NIR Variability in the UKIDSS Ultra Deep Survey: a new probe of AGN activity at high redshift](https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.02468)
  - 用IR长期光变来挑选AGN：only half of the variable sources are also selected using either deep Chandra X-ray imaging or IRAC colour selection
  - Long-term NIR variability identifies AGN at low luminosities and in host galaxies with low stellar masses, many of which appear relatively X-ray quiet.

- [Calibration of a star formation and feedback model for cosmological simulations with Enzo](https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.02670)
  - The model MW galaxy is calibrated using three parameters: the star formation efficiency (f∗), the efficiency of thermal energy from stellar feedback (ϵ) and the region into which feedback is injected (r and s).
  - We find that changing the amount of feedback energy affects the baryon content most significantly.
  - To match the same baryonic properties, with a relatively higher gas to stars conversion efficiency, the feedback strength required is lower, and vice versa.

- [Field/Isolated lenticular galaxies with high SN values: the case of NGC 4546 and its globular cluster system](https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.02765)
  - **Relevant**
  - We estimate a total GC population for NGC 4546 of 390±60 members and specific frequency SN=3.3±0.7, which is relatively high compared to the typical value for galaxies of similar masses and environment.
  - We suggest that the unusual GC population substructures were possibly formed during the interaction that led to the formation of the young ultra-compact dwarf (NGC 4546-UCD1)

- [The impact of AGN feedback on the 1D power spectra from the Lyα forest using the Horizon-AGN suite of simulations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.02822)
  - 基于Horizon-AGN的模拟：AGNs globally suppress the Lyman-α power at all scales.
  - On large scales, the energy injection and ionization dominate over the supply of gas mass from AGN-driven galactic winds, thus suppressing power. On small scales, faster cooling of denser gas mitigates the suppression.
  - 红移越低越显著：Ignoring AGN feedback in cosmological inference analyses leads to strong biases with 2\% shift on σ8 and 1\% shift on ns

- [The VIRUS-P Exploration of Nearby Galaxies (VENGA): The stellar populations and assembly of NGC 2903's bulge, bar, and outer disc](https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.02858)
  - Its stellar bar has 65% of its mass in ages 1-5 Gyr and has metallicities similar to the outer disc, suggestive of the evolutionary picture where the bar forms from disc material.
  - We find enhanced metallicity in the spiral arms and central region, tracing areas of high star formation as seen in the Halpha map.

- [The impact of projection effects on cluster observables: stacked lensing and projected clustering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.03867)
  - **Relevant, Important**
  - 用N-body模拟和halo模型来估计投影效应对类似redMaPPer这样cluster finder的影响
  - Mock observed clusters exhibit lensing and clustering signals that deviate from expectations based on a statistically isotropic halo model -- while both signals agree with halo model expectations on small scales, they show unexpected boosts on large scales, by up to a factor of 1.2 or 1.4 respectively.
  - 主要来自小部分(~30%) embedded within filaments aligned with the line-of-sight 的星系团

- [The X-Ray Cavity Around Hotspot E in Cygnus A: Tunneled by a Deflected Jet](https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.02978)
  - The powerful FR II radio galaxy Cygnus A exhibits primary and secondary hotspots in each lobe. 并且有一个 approximately circular hole, with a radius of 3.9 kpc, centered on the primary hotspot in the eastern radio lob
  - We argue that the jet encounters the shock compressed intracluster medium at hotspot E, passing through one or more shocks as it is deflected back into the radio lobe.
  - These results favor models for multiple hotspots in which an FR II jet is deflected at a primary hotspot, then travels onward to deposit the bulk of its power at a secondary hotspot

- [Analytical model for cluster radio relics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.02986)
  - 对Radio relic的形成进行建模：Press-Schechter formalism to simulate merger rates, analytical models for the intracluster medium and the shock dynamics, as well as a simple model for the cosmic-ray electrons at the merger shocks
  - It turns out that the flux distribution as well as the power-mass relation can constrain key parameters of the intracluster medium. 对如 acceleration efficiency, the magnetic field strength at the relic, the geometry of the relic and the duration of the electron acceleration at merger shocks 这些参数敏感

- [Structural diversity of disc galaxies originating in the cold gas inflow from cosmic webs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.02965)
  - 假设
    - Thin discs form as the shock-heated hot gas in high-mass halos gradually accretes to the central part,
    - Thick discs grow by the direct accretion of cold gas from cosmic webs when the halo mass is low,- Bulges form by the inflow of cold gas through the shock-heated gas in high-redshift massive halos
  - 可以重现出盘星系结构的多样性；This scenario also predicts that thick discs are older and poorer in metals than thin discs
  - 和Brooks+2009类似

- [Interpreting the Spitzer/IRAC Colours of 7<z<9 Galaxies: Distinguishing Between Line Emission and Starlight Using ALMA](https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.02968)
  - 用IRAC研究z>7星系：Many such high redshift galaxies display a red [3.6] - [4.5] micron colour, often referred to as the “IRAC excess” 可能来自[OIII]+Hbeta发射线
  - Given the photometric uncertainties, established stellar populations with Balmer (4000 A, rest-frame) breaks, such as those inferred at z>9 where line emission does not contaminate the IRAC bands, can equally well explain the redshift-dependent behaviour of the IRAC colours in 7 < z <9 galaxies.
  - 可以用ALMA [OIII] 88 micron和尘埃连续谱观测区分

- [Deceptively cold dust in the massive starburst galaxy GN20 at z∼4](https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.02974)
  - NOEMA观测[CI]不同激发看中性气体，激发温度比基于光学薄假设得到的尘埃温度高，但和general opacity model得到的尘埃温度一致
  - 同时也意味着尘埃质量更低；固定气尘比下的分子气体质量更低
  - The derived properties of GN20 thus provide an appealing solution to the puzzling discovery of starbursts appearing colder than main-sequence galaxies above z > 2.5

- [What Drives the Redshift Evolution of Strong Emission Line Ratios?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.02976)
  - 通过local analog研究为什么低红移和高红移星系在BPT图上有系统性地偏移
  - The higher ionisation parameter in the high-redshift analogues is the dominant physical mechanism
  - The N/O ratio enhancement also plays a minor role to cause the BPT offset
  - This hard radiation field cannot be produced by the current standard stellar synthesis models. The stellar rotation and binarity may help solve the discrepancy.

- [The role of galaxy mass on AGN emission: a view from the VANDELS survey](https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.02980)
  - The mass of the host galaxy is a fundamental quantity which determines the level of AGN activity at the various wavelengths.
  - Large stellar masses are found to be connected with AGN radio emission, as virtually all radio-active AGN reside within galaxies of M*>10^{10} Msun.
  - Large stellar masses also seem to favour AGN activity in the X-ray
  - 质量越大的星系，越有可能同时拥有X-ray和射电辐射

- [Identification of filamentary structures in the environment of superclusters of galaxies in the Local Universe](https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.03446)
  - Our methodology implements different classical pattern recognition and machine learning techniques pipelined in the Galaxy Systems-Finding algorithm and the Galaxy Filaments-Finding algorithm.
  - We detected in total 2,705 galaxy systems (clusters and groups, of which 159 are new) and 144 galaxy filaments in the 46 superclusters of galaxies.
  - galaxies closer to the skeleton of the filaments are more massive by up to 25% compared to those in the dispersed component; 70 % of the galaxies in the filament region present early type morphologies and the fractions of active galaxies (both AGN and SF) seem to decrease as galaxies approach the filament.

- [Extended Hα over compact far-infrared continuum in dusty submillimeter galaxies -- Insights into dust distributions and star-formation rates at z∼2](https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.03545)
  - **Interesting**
  - We find that the half-light radius of Hα is significantly larger than that of the FIR continuum in half of the sample, and on average Hα is a median factor of 2.0±0.4 larger.
  - 消光改正后的Halpha SFR依然显著比FIR得到的要低
  - 从尘埃消光角度考虑问题：we postulate that the dust distributions in SMGs, and possibly also in less IR luminous z∼2 massive star-forming galaxies, can be decomposed into three main components; the diffuse dust heated by older stellar populations, the more obscured and extended young star-forming HII regions, and the heavily obscured central regions that have a low filling factor but dominate the infrared luminosity in which the majority of attenuation cannot be probed via UV-to-NIR emissions.

  - 但看到了对MS归一的depletion time随着r/r200增大而变长：星系团中心区域缺少LIRG

  - We interpret the morphology and the kinematics of a third (broader) component (σ > 250 km/s) as suggestive of the presence of non-rotational turbulent motions possibly associated either to an outflow or to the lense.

  - Structures having strong to moderate rotation are defined as cold and warm disks, respectively. Spheroidal structures dominated by random motions are classified as bulges or stellar halos, depending on how tightly bound they are. 还有Disky bulge
  - (1) the morphologically decomposed bulges are composite structures comprised of a slowly rotating bulge, an inner halo, and a disky bulge
  - (2) kinematically disky bulges, akin to what are commonly called pseudo bulges in observations, are compact disk-like components that have rotation similar to warm disk

  - Part of the quenching takes place outside clusters through mass quenching and pre-processing. The e-folding timescale of this "ex-situ quenching phase" is roughly 3 Gyr with a strong inverse mass dependence.
  - The pace of quenching is maintained roughly for 2 Gyr ("delay time") during the first crossing time into the cluster
  - Quenching becomes more dramatic (e-folding timescale of roughly 1 Gyr) after delay time, probably because ram pressure stripping is strongest near the cluster center.

  - The supernova is able to find weak points in the cloud and create channels through which it can escape, leaving much of the well shielded cloud largely unaffected.
  - The expanding supernova deposits its energy in the gas that is in these exposed channels, and hence sweeps up less mass when feedback has already occurred, resulting in faster outflows with less radiative losses

  - We find a correlation between the width of the line in the LAH and the halo flux fraction

  - Passive disks typically have ≥0.5 dex less HI than their active counterparts.

  - It has been demonstrated that in cases where mid-ir wedge-based AGN selection is not possible due to a lack of appropriate data, the selection of quasars using ML algorithms trained with optical/mid-ir photometry in combination with LOFAR data provides an excellent approach for obtaining samples of quasars.

  - The most number of such orbits is enclosed in a 'farfalle'-shape (Italian pasta) form and turns out to be non-periodic

  - 模拟研究：We find that when the BH is embedded in a dense gas core, ionizing radiation attenuated by inefficient BH feeding owing to mechanical feedback hardly affects the gas dynamics at the BH gravitational sphere of influence, from which intense inflows of neutral gas occur at rates substantially exceeding the Eddington limit without impeded by photoionization and heating.
  - Since mechanical power of outflows driven by the rapidly accreting BH is sufficiently strong, bipolar outflows completely evacuate the surrounding gas in the polar region but mass inflows through the equatorial region maintain the BH accretion rate as high as ∼300−10^3 Eddington accretion rate
  - Contrary to naive expectation, the existence of stronger outflow leads to the transition to rapid accretion phases more efficiently.

  - Out to z∼2, EAGLE's and Simba's HIMF and COLF strongly increase, while TNG's HIMF declines and COLF evolves slowly.
  - EAGLE and Simba reproduce high LCO1−0 galaxies at z∼1−2 as observed, owing partly to a median αCO(z=2)∼1 versus αCO(z=0)∼3
  - EAGLE tends to produce somewhat too little HI, TNG overproduces cold gas in massive galaxies, and Simba overproduces molecular gas.

- [Paβ, Hα, and Attenuation in NGC 5194 and NGC 6946](https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.07245)
  - In both galaxies, A(Hα) drops with radius, with a bright, high attenuation inner region
  - IR-to-Hα color does a good job of predicting A(Hα); The local atomic plus molecular gas column density, N(H), also predicts A(Hα) well

- [WALLABY -- An SKA Pathfinder HI Survey](https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.07311)
  - **Important**
  - ASKAP: 36x12-m dishes PAFs. WALLABY aims to survey three-quarters of the sky (-90 degr < Dec < +30 degr) to a redshift of z < 0.26 generate spectral line image cubes at ~30 arcsec resolution and ~1.6 mJy/beam per 4 km/s channel sensitivity.
  - WALLABY is expected to detect over half a million galaxies with a mean redshift of z ~ 0.05 (~200 Mpc).

  - 模拟研究：(I) cross-correlation analysis between galaxies and the fluctuation of Lyα forest transmission (δF); and (II) comparing the overdensity of neutral hydrogen (HI) and galaxies
  - 随着Halo质量，或者恒星质量，或者SFR增加，星系和Lya的CCF增强
  - Our analyses confirm the spatial correlation between galaxies and IGM HI, with more massive galaxies being clustered in higher-density regions as expected from the ΛCDM paradigm.

- [Environmental dependence of galactic properties traced by Lyα forest absorption (II): diversity among galaxy populations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.07335)
  - 观测研究: CLAMATO数据和COSMOS中星系：measure the cross-correlation function (CCF) for 570 galaxies with spec-z measurements, and detect a correlation with the IGM up to 50 h−1 comoving Mpc.
  - 相关信号主要来自10^9-10 Msun星系的贡献；Highest signal in AGNs and SMGs at large scales (r≥5 h−1 Mpc), but in LAEs at small scales

- [WISE Mid-Infrared Properties of compact Active Galactic Nuclei selected from the high-radio-frequency AT20G Survey](https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.07429)
  - We improve upon this by selecting 3610 compact AGNs using their angular size information (∼0.15 arcsec scale) from the Australia Telescope 20 GHz (AT20G) high-angular-resolution catalogue. 用谱指数挑选AGN会带来Bias
  - This shows that mid-infrared SED of high frequency selected compact radio AGN is comparatively less red, possibly due to contributions from their hosts.

- [The apparent anti-correlation between the mass opacity of interstellar dust and the surface-density of interstellar gas](https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.07485)

- [Let us bury the prehistoric h: arguments against using h−1Mpc units in observational cosmology](https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.07829)
  - **Interesting**
  - 使用h^-1 Mpc在归一化功率谱的时候会产生问题，sigma_8是8h^-1 Mpc.
  - This parameter does not correctly capture the impact of h on the amplitude of density fluctuations.
  - We propose to abandon the use of h−1Mpc units in cosmology and to characterize the amplitude of the matter power spectrum in terms of σ12, defined as the mass fluctuation in spheres of radius 12Mpc

- [Detecting Pair-Instability Supernovae at z<5 with the James Webb Space Telescope](https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.07854)
  - The light curves of such transients can be considerably dimmer in the near infrared (NIR) today than those of primordial PISNe of equal energy and progenitor mass.
  - We find that JWST may be able to detect only Pop II (metal-poor) PISNe over the redshift range of z<4, but not their Pop III (metal-free) counterparts.

  - MBII能比较好的重现32个X-ray挑选的AGN的黑洞质量和星系性质的相关；SAM则高估了黑洞质量和星系质量相关的scatter
  - The mass relations in the MBII are highly dependent on AGN feedback while the relations in the SAM are more sensitive to galaxy merger events triggering nuclear activity.
  - 不认为这些关系的出现可以简单的用中心极限定理解释

- [A deep view into the nucleus of the Sagittarius Dwarf Spheroidal Galaxy with MUSE. II. Kinematic characterization of the stellar populations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.07814)
  - We present a detailed kinematic characterization of the three stellar populations present in M54: young metal-rich (YMR); intermediate-age metal-rich (IMR); and old metal-poor (OMP), based on the spectra of ∼6500 individual M54 member stars extracted from a large MUSE/VLT dataset

- [Constraining the recent star formation history of galaxies : an Approximate Bayesian Computation approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.07815)
  - **Useful**
  - The proposed method will determine whether a variation in the last few hundreds of Myr of the SFH is needed to properly model the SED rather than a smooth normal SFH.
  - We argue that flexible SFHs are needed to be able to cover that largest SFR-M* parameter space possible. 

- [Project AMIGA: The Circumgalactic Medium of Andromeda](https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.07818)
  - 43 QSOs that pierce the circumgalactic medium (CGM) of Andromeda (M31) from R=25 to 569 kpc 
  - We find that Si III and O VI have near unity covering factor maintained all the way out to 1.2Rvir and 1.9Rvir. We show that Si III is the dominant ion over Si II and Si IV at any R. 
  - The inner regions of the CGM of M31 are more dynamic and have more complicated multi-phase gas-structures than at R>0.5Rvir.

- [The radio properties of HERGs with intermediate radio powers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.07820)
  - Only 19 per cent of the sample therefore exhibit the double-lobed/edge-brightened structures often associated with their counterparts at high and low radio powers: radio-powerful HERGs and Seyfert galaxies 

- [Towards Studying Hierarchical Assembly in Real Time: A Milky Way Progenitor Galaxy at z = 2.36 under the Microscope](https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.07822)
  - HST + MOSFIRE: 讨论一个可能的与银河系前身星系相近的星系上的UV明亮的clump
  - We conclude that the clump is likely a single entity as opposed to a aggregation of smaller star clusters, making it one of the most dense star clusters
  - If it formed \emph{ex-situ}, then we are witnessing an accretion event with a 1:40 stellar mass ratio. 但不能排除in situ来源。

- [Anisotropic infall in the outskirts of OmegaWINGS galaxy clusters](https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.07825)
  - **Relevant**
  - We find evidence of a more effective quenching in the direction of the filaments.
  - We find that up to ∼70% of post-starburst galaxies in the direction of filaments are likely backsplash, while this number drops to ∼40% in the isotropic infall region.
  - The presence of this small fraction of galaxies in filaments that are falling into clusters for the first time and have been recently quenched, supports a scenario in which a significant number of filament galaxies have been quenched long time ago.

- [The Environment of Lyman Break Analogues (ELBA) survey: Star-forming galaxies in small groups](https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.07828)
  - DES观测z~0.2的LBAs，看local density

- [Newly Improved Ionization Corrections for the Neutral Interstellar Medium: Enabling Accurate Abundance Determinations in Star-forming Galaxies throughout the Universe](https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.07831)
  - 从发射线中提取金属丰度是需要电离改正(ICFs)
  - These new corrections include both the contaminating ionized gas along the line of sight (ICFionized) and unaccounted higher ionization stages in the neutral gas (ICFneutral).
  - we calculate ICFs from a uniform grid of models covering a wide range of physical properties typically observed in studies of SFGs and extragalactic H II regions.

- [Dust Destruction by Charging: A Possible Origin of Grey Extinction Curves of Active Galactic Nuclei](https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.08023)
  - AGN的消光曲线和银河系的比缺少small grains
  - We propose that dust destruction by charging, or Coulomb explosion, may be responsible for AGN extinction curves
  - Grain fission via the Coulomb explosion occurs when the electrostatic tensile stress of a charge grain exceeds its tensile strength

- [Variability and the size-luminosity relation of the intermediate mass AGN in NGC 4395](https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.08028)
  - We monitored NGC 4395 with a ∼5 minute cadence during a period of 10 days and obtained light curves in the UV, V, J, H, and K/Ks bands as well as the Hα narrow-band.
  - We obtained no reliable measurements for the continuum-to-continuum lag between UV and V bands and among near-IR bands, due to the large flux uncertainty of UV observations
  - While the optical luminosity of NGC 4395 is two orders of magnitude lower than that of other reverberation-mapped AGNs, NGC 4395 follows the size-luminosity relation, albeit with an offset of 0.48 dex (≥2.5σ) from the previous best-fit relation of Bentz et al. (2013).

- [Constraining stellar population parameters from narrow band photometric surveys using convolutional neural networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.08028)
  - **Relevant**
  - J-PAS巡天，用CNN技术提取age和金属丰度
  - It is demonstrated that the diversity of the dataset used to train the neural networks has a dramatic effect on the recovery of galactic stellar population parameters

- [ZFIRE: Measuring Electron Density with [OII] as a function of environment at z = 1.62](https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.08353)
  - 看宇宙在z~2附近有没有和SFR整体变化类似的电子密度的变化。
  - We measure a median electron density of ne = 366+/-84 cm-3 for six galaxies (with 1-sigma scatter = 163 cm-3) in the UDS proton-cluster at z=1.62 比相近红移处场中的星系的平均密度高三倍左右。但样本尚过小
  - We conclude that the electron density increases with redshift in both cluster and field environments up to z~2
