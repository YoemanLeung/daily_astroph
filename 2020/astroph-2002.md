  - The spectroscopic temperature and mass estimate are biased low by cooler gas dominating the emission, due to its quadratic density dependence.

- [High Resolution Spectral Line Indices Useful for the Analysis of Stellar Populations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.11521)
  - Here we show that using at least two new spectral line indices defined and measured on high-resolution (R= 6000) spectra of a signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) ≥ 10 one gets unambiguous estimates of the age and metallicity of intermediate to old stellar populations

- [AGN jets versus accretion as reionization sources](https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.11733)
  - The contribution of AGN to the reionization, while most likely not dominant, could have been higher than previously assumed, thanks to the radiation originated in the jet lobes.

### Feb 3

- [Dynamical heating of the X-ray emitting intracluster medium: the roles of merger shocks and turbulence dissipation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.00674)
  - 讨论 the dissipation of intracluster turbulent motions 对加热ICM的重要性，利用高分辨和多时间帧模拟可以看到the dominant role of merger events in heating the ICM.
  - Turbulence heating, rather than direct heating at merger shocks, dominates the temperature increase of the ICM especially at inner radii r< r500c
  - We find that many merger shocks can propagate with almost constant velocity to very large radii r≫r500c, some even reach and join with the accretion shock

- [ORIGIN: Blind detection of faint emission line galaxies in MUSE datacubes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.00214)

### Feb 4

- [On the global alignments of parsec-scale AGN radio jets and their polarization planes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.00982)

- [The ALMA view of the high redshift relation between supermassive black holes and their host galaxies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.00958)
  - We obtained a sample of 10 quasars at z ∼ 2 − 7 in which line emission is detected with high SNR (> 5 − 10) and the gas kinematics is spatially resolved and dominated by ordered rotation
  - The estimated dynamical masses place 6 out of 10 quasars above the local relation yielding to a MBH/Mdyn ratios ∼ 10× higher than those estimated in low-z galaxies.

- [Galaxy mergers in EAGLE do not induce a significant amount of black hole growth yet do increase the rate of luminous AGN](https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.00959)
  - **Interesting**
  - The greatest excess of AGN triggered via a merger are found in lower mass, gas rich, central galaxies with low mas BHs at low redshift.
  - We find no enhancement of AGN triggered via mergers in >10^11 Msun galaxies
  - Major和minor mergers都不是导致黑洞质量增长的主要原因：Whilst at all redshifts the galaxies experiencing a merger have accretion rates that are on average 2–3 times that of isolated galaxies, the majority of mass that is accreted onto BHs occurs outside the periods of a merger.

- [The ALPINE-ALMA [CII] Survey: On the nature of an extremely obscured serendipitous galaxy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.00961)

  - We found that the Xray structure is, in fact, a giant cavity in the X-ray gas filled with diffuse radio emission with an extraordinarily steep radio spectrum 应该是一个很老的AGN活动的遗骸
  - The AGN is currently starved of accreting cool gas because the gas density peak is displaced by core sloshing

  - Massive dark subhalos do not appear to be required to explain the density clumping along GD-1.
  - 没有解释spur特征

- [Reverse engineering the Milky Way](https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.01512)
  - 假设随着矮星系吸积进来的球状星团的年龄，丰度，a/Fe，运动学积分是conservative的，把银河系中的76个GC归类为五个不同的矮星系起源
  - The 5 satellites formed at very early times and were likely accreted 8–11 Gyr ago, indicating rapid growth for the Milky Way in its early evolution.

- [Stellar Population Properties of ETGs in Compact Groups of Galaxies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.01529)
  - We find that the dependences of mean stellar ages, [Z/H] and [α/Fe] on central stellar velocity dispersion are similar, regardless where the ETG resides,
  - We find that ETGs in GCs behave similarly to centrals, especially those embedded in low-mass haloes
  - GC的group速度弥散度分布似乎是bimodel的，高速度弥散的那些spiral比例更低
  - Our findings point to a small environmental impact on galaxies located in CGs. The only evidence we find is the change in gas content, suggesting environmentally-driven gas loss

### Feb 6

- [Scatter in Sunyaev--Zel'dovich effect scaling relations explained by inter-cluster variance in mass accretion histories](https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.01934)
  - We use a simple analytical model to compute the mass assembly-driven non-thermal pressure profiles of individual haloes based on Monte Carlo-generated halo assembly histories from extended Press–Schechter theory
  - The intrinsic scatter in the Sunyaev–Zel’dovich effect observable-mass scaling relation (YSZ − M) due solely to inter-cluster variations in halo mass assembly histories
  - M-YSZ关系在z=0有5-9%的scatter；越往高红移走，越偏离self similar，弥散也会增加

- [Constraining the Mass of the Emerging Galaxy Cluster SpARCS1049+56 at z= 1.71 with Infrared Weak Lensing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.01956)
  - IR weak lensing:  the mass distribution of this young galaxy cluster is mapped and the convergence peak is detected at a 3.3σ level.
  - 3.5x10^14 Msun质量; consistent with the mass derived from a mass-richness scaling relation
  - This mass is extreme for a cluster at such a high redshift and suggests that SpARCS1049+56 is rare in the standard ΛCDM universe

- [Advection by large-scale spiral flows in galaxy clusters](https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.01939)

- [Measuring black hole masses from tidal disruption events: Testing the MBH−σ∗ relation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.02267)
  - An elliptical accretion disk model for tidal disruption events
  - We calculate the radiation efficiency of the elliptical accretion disk and investigate the implications for the observations of TDE
  - Observations are well consistent with the expectations and that the majority of the orbital energy of the stellar debris is advected onto the black hole (BH) without being converted into radiation
  - 能够用来估计黑洞质量，和MBH-sigma估计的一致

- [Dust entrainment in galactic winds](https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.01933)
  - 超新星驱动的风中会有渗入的中性气体和分子气体，以及尘埃，会给CGM增丰：This ejected dust encodes information about the integrated star formation and outflow history of the galaxy
  - Stellar feedback is efficient in driving dust-enriched winds and eject enough material to account for the amount of extraplanar dust observed in nearby galaxies.
  - Moreover, the outflowing cold-dense gas is significantly more dust-enriched than the volume filling hot tenuous material

- [A robust two-parameter description of the stellar profile of elliptical galaxies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.01940)
  - **Relevant**
  - I propose to use the stellar mass enclosed within 10 kpc in projection, M∗,10, and the mass-weighted stellar density slope within the same aperture, Γ∗,10
  - 对一组SDSS/GAMA星系的HSC图像进行测量，在给定的M10和Gamma10上看profile的变化；并合模拟比较
  - The pair of values of (M∗,10, Γ∗,10) can be used to predict the stellar density profile in the inner 10 kpc of a galaxy with better than 20% accuracy

- [Evolution of the grain size distribution in galactic discs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.01945)
  - 大小颗粒尘埃比例：The DS /DL ratio as a function of the galactocentric distance and metallicity is directly compared to what is predicted by the SPH simulations.

- [Luminous Lyman-alpha Emitters with Very Blue UV-continuum Slopes at Redshift 5.7 <= z <= 6.6](https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.02028)
  - We find that their UV-continuum slopes β are in a range of −3.4 ≤ β ≤ −2.6
  - β ≃ −2.6±0.2 galaxies can be well fitted with young and dust-free stellar populations; 更蓝的LAE就不好拟合了
  - 其他的解释： Larger fesc values and very low metallicities are not favored by the strong nebular line emission; combination of a very young population with a high fesc (≥ 0.5) and an old, dusty population

- [Diffuse Lyman-alpha Halos around ~300 Spectroscopically Confirmed Lyman-alpha Emitters at z ~ 5.7](https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.02029)
  - Stacking分析：By comparing the stacked objects with their corresponding point spread functions, we clearly detect extended LAHs around these LAEs.
  - The scale lengths of the LAHs, when described by a double-component model, range from 1.2 to 5.3 kpc with a typical value of ∼2 kpc.
  - We also find that LAEs with higher Lyman-alpha luminosities, higher UV continuum luminosities or smaller Lyman-alpha equivalent widths tend to have larger LAH sizes.
  - Our results are consistent with a scenario that LAHs originate from the scattered light of the central galaxies by H I gas in the circumgalactic medium.

- [Determining the Co-Rotation Radii of Spiral Galaxies Using Spiral Arm Pitch Angle Measurements at Multiple Wavelengths](https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.02307)
  - Density wave theory predicts that spiral arms observed from different wavelengths show a phase crossing at the co-rotation radius.
  - We then found rotation curve data for six of our galaxies and used our co-rotation radii estimates to measure the time that would elapse between star formation and moving to their observed positions in the B-band spirals. The average time lapse for this motion was found to be ∼ 50 Myr.

- [The OTELO survey. II. The faint-end of the Hα luminosity function at z ∼ 0.40](https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.02449)
  - The Hα luminosity function at z∼0.40 is obtained, which extends the current faint end by almost 1 dex
  - We find that no AGN should be expected below a luminosity of log10L=38.6 erg s
  - From the sample of non-AGN (presumably, pure SFG) at z∼0.40 we estimated a star formation rate density of ρSFR=0.012±0.005 M⊙ yr−1 Mpc−3.
