- [Star formation in outer rings of S0 galaxies. II. NGC 4513 -- a multi-spin ringed S0 galaxy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.12412)
  - The stellar component of the ring is much more massive than can be explained by the current star formation level in the ring. We conclude that probably the ring of NGC 4513 is a result of tidal disruption of a massive gas-rich satellite

  - ALMA高分辨观测z=3的透镜星系，利用PDR模型估计FUV辐射场强度，气体密度和温度，发现和Orion Trapezium区域类似
  - The [Cii] emission is significantly more extended than that FIR continuum: ∼50 per cent of [C ii] emission arises outside the FIR-bright region.
  - The observed [Cii]/FIR deficit trend is consistent with thermal saturation of the C+ fine-structure level occupancy at high gas temperatures.

- [The growth of bulges and discs in relatively HI-rich galaxies: indication from HI scaling relations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.13178)
  - We find that at fixed stellar mass, disc colours are correlated with the Hi mass fraction
  - 但核球颜色和HI比例无关，即便是伪核球也没有；bulge和disc的颜色也无明显相关
  - HI与disc成长有关，和Bulge关系不大

- [Cross-Correlation of Far-Infrared Background Anisotropies and CMB Lensing form Herschel and Planck satellites](https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.12840)
  - We measure the auto-correlation power spectrum of the CIB anisotropies in the Herschel-SPIRE Her- MES Large Mode Survey (HeLMS) and the cross power spectrum between HeLMS CIB and the CMB lensing from Planck
  - We also calculate the theoretical CIB auto- and cross-power spectra of CIB and CMB lensing by assuming that the CIB emissivity follows Gaussian distribution in redshift.

### Jan 13

- [Growing Pains: The Formation Times and Building Blocks of Milky Way-mass Galaxies in the FIRE Simulations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.03178)
  - We find that the main progenitor of a MW/M31-mass galaxy emerged typically at z ~ 3-4 (11.6-12.2 Gyr ago), while stars in the bulge region (inner 2 kpc) at z = 0 formed primarily in a single main progenitor at z < 5
  - LG情形下的main progenitor比isolated情形下的出现得要早, 质量也要更大
  - Overall, about 100 galaxies with M_star > 10^5 M_sun formed a typical MW/M31-mass system

- [The peculiar emission line spectra of core-Extremely Red BOSS Quasars at z∼2-3: orientation and/or evolution?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.03379)

- [Stratified disc wind models for the AGN broad-line region: ultraviolet, optical and X-ray properties](https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.03625)
  - Clumpy biconical disc winds illuminated by an AGN continuum can produce BLR-like spectra
  - Disc wind: are self-shielded flows and can cover a large portion of the ionizing flux-density (ϕH-nH) plane
  - The line emission arises almost exclusively from plasma travelling below the escape velocity, implying that `failed winds' are important BLR candidates.

- [Nuclear Star Clusters](https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.03626)
  - **Review**
  - NSC性质在10^9质量的星系上下有改变，低质量的更符合来自GC的inspiral，高质量的可能是in situ的恒星形成

- [A hyper luminous starburst at z=4.72 magnified by a lensing galaxy pair at z=1.48](https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.03641)
  - Discovered in the Herschel Reference Survey an extremely bright IR at z=4.7
  - Lens的红移非常高：These two sources are placed at z=1.48 with XSHOOTER spectra, suggesting that they could be merging and gravitationally lensing the emission of RV4
  - We discuss that the short tdepl of RV4 can be explained by either a very high SFE, which is difficult to reconcile with major mergers simulations of high-z galaxies, or a rapid decrease of SF, which would bias the estimate of tdepl toward low value.

- [Deciphering Lyman α blob 1 with deep MUSE observations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.03699)
  - Various gas excitation mechanisms are at play in LAB 1: Ionising radiation and feedback effects dominate near the embedded galaxies, while Lyα scattering is contributing at larger distances.
  - The HeII/Lyα ratios combined with the upper limits on CIV/Lyα ratios favour shock models over photo-ionisation.
  - LAB1 resides at a node of multiple intersecting filaments of the cosmic web

- [xGASS: Robust quantification of asymmetries in global HI spectra and their relationship to environmental processes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.04037)
  - We demonstrate that the asymmetry in a HI spectrum is strongly linked to its signal-to-noise 不同样本不能简单比较
  - Find that the typical galaxy detected by xGASS exhibits higher asymmetry than what can be attributed to noise alone
  - Asymmetric galaxies contain, on average, 29% less HI mass compared to their symmetric counterparts matched in both stellar mass and signal-to-noise. 卫星星系可能也比central更容易有不对称的HI谱线；环境过程可能很重要

- [The Formation History of Subhalos and the Evolution of Satellite Galaxies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.04090)
  - **Relevant**
  - 用subhalo被并合之前的formation history来描述其形成历史：年轻subhalo中的卫星星系质量偏低，更富气体，SF更强，同时ex-situ恒星比例更高
  - 这些年轻subhalo中的星系也需要更长的时间被quenched

- [Qwind code release. A non-hydrodynamical approach to modelling line-driven winds in active galactic nuclei](https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.04720)

- [Nonstationarity of AGN variability: The only way to go is down!](https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.04471)
  - SDSS-HSC AGN亮度比较，发现平均亮度降低，且有红移依赖: At a given redshift, the mean decrease in brightness is stronger for more luminous AGN and for objects with longer time separation between measurements.
  - The mean decrease in brightness with time violates the stationarity assumption often invoked in AGN variability studies

- [Interacting galaxies in the IllustrisTNG simulations -- II: Star formation in the post-merger stage](https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.04472)
  - We present a sample of 27,691 post-merger (PM) galaxies (0≤z≤1) identified from IllustrisTNG
  - We demonstrate that star forming (SF) PMs exhibit enhanced star formation rates (SFRs) on average by a factor of ∼2, while the passive PMs show no statistical enhancement 质量越小，气体含量越高，SF增强越显著，和红移没有明显关系

- [Cradles of the first stars: self-shielding, halo masses, and multiplicity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.04480)
  - Self-shielding can alleviate the effect the LW background has on the H2 within haloes.
  - Haloes form Pop III stars at much lower masses, up to a factor of a few, due to the inclusion of H2 self-shielding.
  - Most haloes form multiple Pop III stars, with a median number of four, up to a maximum of 16, at the instance of Pop III formation.

  - 比single-phase photoionization假设更进一步：we use the MAIHEM code to model an isotropic turbulent medium exposed to a redshift zero metagalactic UV background, while tracking the ionizations, recombinations, and species-by-species radiative cooling for a wide range of ions.
  - By including multiple phases, MAIHEM models favor a higher metallicity (Z/Z⊙≈40%) for the circumgalactic medium compared to PIE models.

  - Our modelling suggests that this DLA formed very few stars until >1 Gyr after the cosmic reionization of hydrogen and, despite its very low metallicity (~1/1000 of solar), this DLA appears to have formed most of its stars in the past few hundred Myr.
  - Very metal-poor DLAs may have been affected by reionization quenching

  - Some of these so-called “quenched” galaxies may still have significant gas reservoirs and be unlikely to deplete them any time soon.

  - High-velocity-based studies could miss ∼2/3 of the Milky Way’s CGM mass
  - Once we correct velocities from the local standard of rest to the galaxy’s rest frame, gas infall rate 下降
  - O vi and N v are likely to be good UV tracers of the Milky Way’s outer CGM (r 􏰀15 kpc), whereas C iv maybe less sensitive

  - **Relevant**
  - While 80% of the galaxies have low spins (λ < 0.1) and low rotational velocities (< 50 km s−1) in both the central region and the main body, we find a diverse range of velocity features and misalignment angles.
  - 10/18中心运动学有misalignment，角度在15-90度之间
  - The central and main-body kinematic axes within a galaxy are not always aligned. When the two kinematic axes are aligned (∼ 60% of the cases), they are either also aligned with the photometric major axis or orthogonal to it.
  - A diverse assembly history consisting of multiple gas-poor mergers of a variety of progenitor mass ratios and orbits is likely to be needed to account for the predominance of low spins and the wide range of central and main-body velocity features
