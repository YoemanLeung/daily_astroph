### Jan 13

- [Growing Pains: The Formation Times and Building Blocks of Milky Way-mass Galaxies in the FIRE Simulations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.03178)
  - We find that the main progenitor of a MW/M31-mass galaxy emerged typically at z ~ 3-4 (11.6-12.2 Gyr ago), while stars in the bulge region (inner 2 kpc) at z = 0 formed primarily in a single main progenitor at z < 5
  - LG情形下的main progenitor比isolated情形下的出现得要早, 质量也要更大
  - Overall, about 100 galaxies with M_star > 10^5 M_sun formed a typical MW/M31-mass system

- [The peculiar emission line spectra of core-Extremely Red BOSS Quasars at z∼2-3: orientation and/or evolution?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.03379)

  - 定位在10‘左右; 和non-repeating比，有重现的FRB的DM测量基本一致，但burst width明显要宽: further supporting the notion of inherently different emission mechanisms and/or local environments

  - 在完美prior，就是完整templates library的前提下，讨论一批Photo-z算法对PDF的估计
  - We report systematic biases and overall over/under-breadth of the photo-z PDFs of many popular codes, which may indicate avenues for improvement in the algorithms or implementations.

- [Stratified disc wind models for the AGN broad-line region: ultraviolet, optical and X-ray properties](https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.03625)
  - Clumpy biconical disc winds illuminated by an AGN continuum can produce BLR-like spectra  
  - Disc wind: are self-shielded flows and can cover a large portion of the ionizing flux-density (ϕH-nH) plane
  - The line emission arises almost exclusively from plasma travelling below the escape velocity, implying that `failed winds' are important BLR candidates.

- [Nuclear Star Clusters](https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.03626)
  - **Review**
  - NSC性质在10^9质量的星系上下有改变，低质量的更符合来自GC的inspiral，高质量的可能是in situ的恒星形成
  - The extreme densities of NSCs and their interaction with massive black holes lead to a wide range of unique phenomena including tidal disruption and gravitational wave events

- [A hyper luminous starburst at z=4.72 magnified by a lensing galaxy pair at z=1.48](https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.03641)
  - Discovered in the Herschel Reference Survey an extremely bright IR at z=4.7
  - Lens的红移非常高：These two sources are placed at z=1.48 with XSHOOTER spectra, suggesting that they could be merging and gravitationally lensing the emission of RV4
  - We discuss that the short tdepl of RV4 can be explained by either a very high SFE, which is difficult to reconcile with major mergers simulations of high-z galaxies, or a rapid decrease of SF, which would bias the estimate of tdepl toward low value.

- [Deciphering Lyman α blob 1 with deep MUSE observations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.03699)
  - Various gas excitation mechanisms are at play in LAB 1: Ionising radiation and feedback effects dominate near the embedded galaxies, while Lyα scattering is contributing at larger distances.
  - The HeII/Lyα ratios combined with the upper limits on CIV/Lyα ratios favour shock models over photo-ionisation.
  - LAB1 resides at a node of multiple intersecting filaments of the cosmic web

- [xGASS: Robust quantification of asymmetries in global HI spectra and their relationship to environmental processes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.04037)
  - We demonstrate that the asymmetry in a HI spectrum is strongly linked to its signal-to-noise 不同样本不能简单比较
  - Find that the typical galaxy detected by xGASS exhibits higher asymmetry than what can be attributed to noise alone
  - Asymmetric galaxies contain, on average, 29% less HI mass compared to their symmetric counterparts matched in both stellar mass and signal-to-noise. 卫星星系可能也比central更容易有不对称的HI谱线；环境过程可能很重要

- [The Formation History of Subhalos and the Evolution of Satellite Galaxies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.04090)
  - **Relevant**
  - 用subhalo被并合之前的formation history来描述其形成历史：年轻subhalo中的卫星星系质量偏低，更富气体，SF更强，同时ex-situ恒星比例更高
  - 这些年轻subhalo中的星系也需要更长的时间被quenched
  - Fast accretion halo中的卫星和slow accretion中的比，并合更频繁，并合时对星暴的抬升更明显；Slow accretion的并合过程更平滑

- [The AGORA high-resolution galaxy simulations comparison project: Public data release](https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.04354)

  - 看thermal pressure, radiation and cosmic rays在驱动外流上的影响
  - Radiation-driven winds in typical starburst-galaxy configurations are unable to attain the higher flow velocities and temperatures associated with thermal and cosmic ray-driven systems, leading to higher wind densities which would be more susceptible to cooling and fragmentation at lower altitudes.

- [Faint LAEs near z>4.7 CIV absorbers revealed by MUSE](https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.04453)
  - 在11 CIV absorption systems at z>4.7周围找LAE:The impact parameter of LAE-CIV systems with equivalent widths W0(CIV)>0.5 {\AA} is in the range 11 <ρ< 200 proper kpc (pkpc) 大多数都是faint LAE

- [A spectroscopic survey of Abell 1703: is it a rare relaxed cluster hosting a radio halo or a usual merging system?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.04707)
  - The results of our study disagree with the picture of an unimodal, relaxed cluster as suggested by previous studies based on the gravitational lensing analysis and support the view of a perturbed dynamics

- [Qwind code release. A non-hydrodynamical approach to modelling line-driven winds in active galactic nuclei](https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.04720)
  - UV line driven winds may be an important part of the AGN feedback process, but understanding their impact is hindered by the complex nature of the radiation hydrodynamics

- [The discovery of radio halos in the Frontier Fields clusters Abell S1063 and Abell 370](https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.04725)
  - GMRT在两个FF星系团中都看到了radio halo： This spectral steepening provides support for the turbulent re-acceleration model for radio halo formation
  - Both radio halos follow the known scaling relation between the cluster mass proxy Y500 and radio power, consistent with the idea that they are related to ongoing cluster merger events.

- [Nonstationarity of AGN variability: The only way to go is down!](https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.04471)
  - SDSS-HSC AGN亮度比较，发现平均亮度降低，且有红移依赖: At a given redshift, the mean decrease in brightness is stronger for more luminous AGN and for objects with longer time separation between measurements.
  - The mean decrease in brightness with time violates the stationarity assumption often invoked in AGN variability studies 

- [Interacting galaxies in the IllustrisTNG simulations -- II: Star formation in the post-merger stage](https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.04472)
  - We present a sample of 27,691 post-merger (PM) galaxies (0≤z≤1) identified from IllustrisTNG
  - We demonstrate that star forming (SF) PMs exhibit enhanced star formation rates (SFRs) on average by a factor of ∼2, while the passive PMs show no statistical enhancement 质量越小，气体含量越高，SF增强越显著，和红移没有明显关系

- [LoCuSS: exploring the connection between local environment, star formation and dust mass in Abell 1758](https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.04478)
  - We observe that the main subclusters (A1758N and A1758S) belong to two separate large-scale structures, with no overlapping galaxy members SF星系分布在cluster外部

  - Our work extends the analysis at lower sensitivities in both M⋆ and SFR surface densities, up to a factor ∼ 10.

- [Cradles of the first stars: self-shielding, halo masses, and multiplicity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.04480)
  - Self-shielding can alleviate the effect the LW background has on the H2 within haloes.
  - Haloes form Pop III stars at much lower masses, up to a factor of a few, due to the inclusion of H2 self-shielding.
  - Most haloes form multiple Pop III stars, with a median number of four, up to a maximum of 16, at the instance of Pop III formation.

- [Interpreting Observations of Absorption Lines in the Circumgalactic Medium with a Turbulent Medium](https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.04965)
  - 比single-phase photoionization假设更进一步：we use the MAIHEM code to model an isotropic turbulent medium exposed to a redshift zero metagalactic UV background, while tracking the ionizations, recombinations, and species-by-species radiative cooling for a wide range of ions.
  - By including multiple phases, MAIHEM models favor a higher metallicity (Z/Z⊙≈40%) for the circumgalactic medium compared to PIE models.

- [Central molecular zones in galaxies: 12CO-to-13CO ratios, carbon budget, and X factors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.04975)
