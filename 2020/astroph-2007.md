### July 1

- [The Variance and Covariance of Counts-in-Cells Probabilities](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.00011)
    - Counts-in-cells (CIC) measurements contain a wealth of cosmological information yet are seldom used to constrain theories
    - We derive explicit formulae that accurately predict the variance and covariance among subvolumes of a simulated galaxy catalog, opening the door to the use of CIC measurements for cosmological parameter estimation.

- [Suppressed heat conductivity in the intracluster medium: implications for the magneto-thermal instability](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.00018)
    - ICM外围温度随半径下降。这个区域的等离子体基本没有碰撞，容易产生Magneto-Thermal Instability (MTI)，可以提供扰动，产生压力来支撑ICM。
    - In this paper we investigate the influence of reduced heat transport on the nonlinear evolution of the MTI by employing a subgrid model that mimics the influence of the mirror instability on the heat conductivity.

- [Deep Learning for Strong Lensing Search: Tests of the Convolutional Neural Networks and New Candidates from KiDS DR3](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.00188)
    - 用CNN找SL：We build two sets of training samples, one fully from simulations, and the other one using the LRG stamps from KiDS observations as the foreground lens images.
    - With the former training sample, we find 48 high probability candidates after human-inspection, and among them, 27 are newly identified. Using the latter training set, about 67\% of the aforementioned 48 candidates are also found, and there are 11 more new strong lensing candidates identified

- [Large Scale Structure Reconstruction with Short-Wavelength Modes: Halo Bias and Light Cone Formalism](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.00226)
    - We propose a method of indirectly measuring large scale structure using information from small scale perturbations
    - The idea is to build a quadratic estimator from small scale modes that provides a map of structure on large scales.
    - Here we generalize the theory to the case of a light-cone with halo bias and redshift space distortions taken into consideration.

- [Constraining the masses of high-redshift clusters with weak lensing: Revised shape calibration testing for the impact of stronger shears and increased blending](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.00386)
    - **Relevant**
    - We studied the impact of increased blending and light contamination from cluster and foreground galaxies, finding it negligible for z>0.7 clusters, whereas there is an effect at the ∼1% level for lower redshift clusters.
    - Our pipeline is calibrated to an accuracy of ∼0.015, which is fully sufficient for current and near-future weak lensing studies of high-redshift clusters.

- [The role of galactic dynamics in shaping the physical properties of giant molecular clouds in Milky Way-like galaxies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.00006)
    - AREPO模拟银河系，包括了80000多大质量分子云，大量HII区
    - The simulated molecular clouds are highly overdense (∼100×) and over-pressured (∼25×) relative to the ambient interstellar medium.
    - The clouds display clear, statistically-significant correlations of their rotational properties with the rates of galactic shearing and gravitational free-fall.

- [Supermassive black hole fueling in IllustrisTNG: Impact of environment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.00014)
    - TNG中的AGN环境：About ∼10% and ∼1% of them live in pairs and multiples, respectively, within 0.1 h−1Mpc scales.
    - We find that BH systems have enhanced likelihood (up to factors of 3-6) of containing high Eddington ratio (η≳0.7) AGN compared to random pairs and multiples. Conversely, the likelihood of an AGN to live in 0.1h−1Mpc scale systems is also higher (by factors ∼4 for η≳0.7) compared to random pairs and multiples.
    - We also estimate that ∼10% of ultra-hard X-ray selected AGN in TNG100 have detectable 2-10 keV AGN companions on 0.1 h−1Mpc scales 和观测相符合

- [The relationship between fine galaxy stellar morphology and star formation activity in cosmological simulations: a deep learning view](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.00039)
    - We propose an unsupervised deep learning approach to perform a stringent test of the fine morphological structure of galaxies coming from the Illustris and IllustrisTNG (TNG100 and TNG50) simulations against observations
    - We adopt a strategy that combines the output of two PixelCNN networks in a metric that isolates the fine morphological details of galaxies from the sky background. We are able to \emph{quantitatively} identify the improvements of IllustrisTNG, particularly in the high-resolution TNG50 run, over the original Illustris. 但精细形态上TNG和SDSS依然不同

- [The Energetics of Launching the Most Powerful Jets in Quasars: A Study of 3C82](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.00170)
    - 3C 82 belongs to the class of compact steep spectrum radio sources.
    - The first high signal to noise optical spectroscopic observation obtained of this object indicates that there is a powerful high ionization broad line wind with a kinetic power ∼10^45ergs/sec and a velocity ∼0.01c

- [A new estimator of resolved molecular gas in nearby galaxies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.00174)
    - We explore this correlation on kiloparsec scales with CO(1-0) maps from EDGE-CALIFA matched in resolution to WISE 12μm images.
    - We find strong CO-12μm correlations within each galaxy (median Pearson r=0.85) and we show that the scatter in the global CO-12μm correlation is largely driven by differences from galaxy to galaxy.
    - 能用12micron数据结合星系性质预测H2气体密度；with an average predictive accuracy of 0.19 dex per pixel, and intrinsic scatter of 0.17 dex.

- [Resolved Multi-element Stellar Chemical Abundances in the Brightest Quiescent Galaxy at z ∼ 2](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.00205)
    - **Relevant**
    - We analyze deep spectra of MRG-M0138, a lensed quiescent galaxy at z = 1.98 which is the brightest of its kind, with an H-band magnitude of 17.1
    - Taking advantage of full spectral fitting, we measure [Mg/Fe]=0.51±0.05, [Fe/H]=0.26±0.04
    - We detect no gradient in age or [Mg/Fe] and a slightly negative gradient in [Fe/H], which has a slope comparable to that seen in local early-type galaxies.

- [Infrared Telescope Facility (IRTF) spectral library II: New indices in Y, J, H, and L atmospheric windows](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.00569)
    - 谱特征指数方法：Our project investigates the sensitivity of various spectral features in the 1-5\,μm wavelength range to the physical properties of stars (Teff, [Fe/H], log g) and aims to objectively define spectral indices that can characterize the age and metallicity of unresolved stellar populations.
    - We complement the previous work in the I and K bands, reporting a new system of 14, 12, 22, and 12 indices for Y, J, H, and L atmospheric windows
    - The surface gravity is more challenging and only indices in the H and J windows are best suited for this.

- [The 2MASS redshift survey galaxy group catalogue derived from a graph-theory based friends-of-friends algorithm](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.00581)
    - **Useful**
    - 2MRS的新的Group catalog：The galaxy group catalogue is generated by using a novel, graph-theory based, modified version of the Friends-of-Friends algorithm.
    - This has resulted in a stable and robust catalogue with on-sky positions and line-of-sight distances within 0.5 Mpc and 2 Mpc, respectively

### July 2

- [x-cut Cosmic Shear: Optimally Removing Sensitivity to Baryonic and Nonlinear Physics with an Application to the Dark Energy Survey Year 1 Shear Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.00675)
    - x-cut cosmic shear, which optimally removes sensitivity to poorly modeled scales from the two-point cosmic shear signal.
    - Performing an x-cut cosmic shear analysis of the Dark Energy Survey Year 1 (DESY1) shear data, we reduce the error on S8 by 20% relative to a correlation function analysis, while showing our constraints are robust to different baryonic feedback models.

- [Probing the high-z IGM with the hyperfine transition of 3He+](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.00934)
    - The hyperfine transition of 3He+ at 3.5cm has been thought as a probe of the high-z IGM since it offers a unique insight into the evolution of the helium component of the gas, as well as potentially give an independent constraint on the 21cm signal from neutral hydrogen.
    - As the evolution of HeII is determined by stars, we find that it is not possible to distinguish reionization histories driven by more energetic sources.
    - On the other hand, while a bright QSO produces a signal in 21cm that is very similar to the one from a large collection of galaxies, its signature in 3.5cm is very peculiar and could be a powerful probe to identify the presence of the QSO

- [Iron in X-COP: tracing enrichment in cluster outskirts with high accuracy abundance profiles](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.01084)
    - **Relevant, Interesting**
    - 大质量星系团到R500的金属丰度轮廓，发现到外围还是变平
    - We find no evidence of segregation between cool-core and non-cool-core systems beyond ∼0.3R500；说明Cool core不影响整体性质
    - Our mean abundance within R500 shows a very modest scatter, <15%, suggesting the enrichment process must be quite similar in all these massive systems.
    - By combing ICM with stellar measurements we have found the amount of Fe diffused in the ICM to be about ten times higher than that locked in stars

- [Inverse stellar population age gradients of post-starburst galaxies at z=0.8 with LEGA-C](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.00663)
    - 基于Lick index
    - PSB galaxies have radially decreasing HδA and increasing Fe4383 profiles. In contrast, a control sample of quiescent, non-PSB galaxies
    - A two-SSP model suggests intrinsic gradients are as strong as observed in local PSB galaxies
    - At z≈0.8, central starbursts are often the result of gas-rich mergers, as evidenced by the high fraction of PSB galaxies with disturbed morphologies and tidal features (40%)

- [The Velocity Dispersion Function for Quiescent Galaxies in Nine Strong-Lensing Clusters](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.00679)
    - **Relevant**
    - We construct the velocity dispersion functions for quiescent galaxies with Dn4000>1.5 and within R200. The cluster velocity dispersion functions all show excesses at σ≳250kms−1 compared to the field velocity dispersion function.
    - The velocity dispersion function slope at large velocity dispersion (σ>160kms−1) is steeper for more massive clusters

- [Role of cosmic rays in the early stages of galactic outflows](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.00696)
    - we show that CRs do not have any noticeable effect on the mass loading by the outflow. We find that CRs can reduce the size of the outflow, which contradicts previous claims of efficient dynamical impact of CRs; however, it is consistent with earlier theoretical models of cosmic ray driven blastwave as well as stellar wind.

- [Keck Cosmic Web Imager (KCWI) Spectra of Globular Clusters and Ultra Compact Dwarfs in the Halo of M87](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.00739)
    - **Relevant**
    - We find evidence for a dual stellar population in the M87 halo light, i.e an ∼80\% component by mass which is old and metal-rich and a ∼20\% component which is old but metal-poor.
    - UCD星族相对年轻，our findings are consistent with the scenario that UCDs are the remnant nucleus of a stripped galaxy
    - 恒星速度弥散度在外围下降：We further investigate the discrepancy in the literature for M87's kinematics at large radii, favouring a declining velocity dispersion profile.

- [The structure of stellar disks in isolated lenticular galaxies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.01129)
    - 42 isolated lenticular galaxies
    - We noted a prominent difference between stellar disks of S0s galaxies in quite rarefied environments and in clusters: it is only in sparse environments that Type II disks, with profile truncations, can be found.

- [VALES VI: ISM enrichment in star-forming galaxies up to z∼0.2 using 12CO(1-0), 13CO(1-0) and C18O(1-0) line luminosity ratios](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.01182)
    - ALMA观测27个低红移SFG: Galaxies with evidences of possible merging activity tend to show higher L′(12CO)/L′(13CO) ratios by a factor of two, while variations of this order are also found in galaxy samples with higher star formation rates or star formation efficiencies

- [Testing the accuracy of 3D-HST photometric redshift estimates as reference samples for deep weak lensing studies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.01211)
    - Through the comparison to spectroscopic redshifts and photo-zs based on very deep data from the Hubble Ultra Deep Field, we identify catastrophic redshift outliers in the 3D-HST/CANDELS catalogue.
    - We investigate the cause of these outliers and demonstrate that the interpolation of spectral energy distribution (SED) templates and a well-selected combination of photometric data can reduce the net impact for weak lensing studies.

- [MeerKAT-16 HI observation of the dIrr galaxy WLM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.01292)
    - 16 dishes Meerkast观测；运动学建模；有non-circular运动的成分
    - We model the mass distribution of WLM with a pseudo-isothermal (ISO) and a Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) dark matter halo models.

### July 5

- [TDCOSMO III: Dark matter substructure meets dark energy -- the effects of (sub)halos on strong-lensing measurements of H0](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.01308)
    - 看QSO lensing测H0里面Halo sub-structure带来的影响：We base the mock lenses on six quadruply-imaged quasars that have delivered measurements of the Hubble constant, and quantify the additional uncertainties and/or bias on a lens-by-lens basis.
    - 不会bias H0测量，但会增加误差

- [Impact of Relativistic Effects on the Primordial Non-Gaussianity Signature in the Large-Scale Clustering of Quasars](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.01802)
    - **SSST**
    - Relativistic effects in clustering observations have been shown to introduce scale-dependent corrections to the galaxy over-density field on large scales, which may hamper the detection of primordial non-Gaussianity fNL through the scale-dependent halo bias.
    - Although one could mitigate the impact on the fNL signature by adjusting the redshift range or the luminosity threshold of the tracer sample being considered, we suggest that, for future surveys probing large cosmic volumes, relativistic corrections should be forward modelled from the tracer luminosity function including its uncertainties.

- [KiDS-1000 Methodology: Modelling and inference for joint weak gravitational lensing and spectroscopic galaxy clustering analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.01844)
    - A joint cosmological analysis of weak gravitational lensing from the fourth data release of the ESO Kilo-Degree Survey (KiDS-1000) and galaxy clustering from the partially overlapping BOSS and 2dFLenS surveys
    - All weak lensing signals are measured consistently via Fourier-space statistics that are insensitive to the survey mask and display low levels of mode mixing
    - Compared to the previous KiDS analyses, S8 constraints are expected to improve by 20% for weak lensing alone and by 29% for the joint analysis.

- [KiDS-1000 catalogue: weak gravitational lensing shear measurements](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.01845)
    - **Useful**
    - Our `gold-sample' of galaxies, with well calibrated photometric redshift distributions, consists of 21 million galaxies with an effective number density of ∼6.2 galaxies per square arcminute.
    - PSF residuals are detected in the highest-redshift bins, originating from object selection and/or weight bias

- [Testing KiDS cross-correlation redshifts with simulations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.01846)
    - We quantify the performance of the clustering redshifts by comparing the cross-correlation results with the true redshift distributions in each of the five KiDS photometric redshift bins
    - Clustering mean redshifts are unbiased at |Δz|<0.006 under these conditions. The redshift evolution of the galaxy bias can be reliably mitigated at this level of precision using auto-correlation measurements and self-consistency relations
    - 但是还是需要对什么才是真正的红移分布格外小心

- [X-ray Properties of Young Radio Quasars at z > 4.5](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.01342)
    - Chandra X-ray observations of 15 young radio quasars at redshifts 4.5<z<5.0
    - Rest-frame radio and X-ray luminosities are established for the sample, and a correlation between the luminosities is detected. 类星体能谱在很宽一段红移范围内都没有演化

- [Statistical Microlensing Toward Magnified High-Redshift Star Clusters](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.01301)
    - We study light variability of gravitationally magnified high-redshift star clusters induced by a foreground population of microlenses.
    - The light curve resembles a scale-invariant, Gaussian process on timescales of years to decades, while exhibits rapid and frequent micro-caustic crossing flares of larger amplitudes on timescales of days to months.
    - 结合最近发现的Suburst arc里的星团进行讨论，认为JWST观测可以探测到预计的1-2%的光变幅度
    - Given the typical surface density of intracluster stars, we expect this phenomenon to be relevant for many other gravitationally magnified star clusters at Cosmic Noon behind galaxy cluster lenses.

- [On the relation between mini-halos and AGN feedback in clusters of galaxies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.01306)
    - 关于Cool-core星系团中心的射点mini-halo：we confirmed the mini-halo in the massive strong cool core cluster PKS 0745−191 (z=0.1028) and discovered one in the massive cool core cluster MACS J1447.4+0827 (z=0.3755)
    - We find evidence of strong, previously unknown correlations between mini-halo radio power and X-ray cavity power, and between mini-halo and the central galaxy radio power related to the relativistic jets when spectrally decomposing the AGN radio emission into a component for past outbursts and one for on-going accretion.
    - AGN feedback may therefore not only play a vital role in offsetting cooling in cool core clusters, but may also play a fundamental role in re-energizing non-thermal particles in clusters.

- [The Size and Pervasiveness of Lyα-UV Spatial Offsets in Star-Forming Galaxies at z∼6](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.01310)
    - 高红移星系的rest-frame UV和Lya发射中心有时不重合：While we find that ~40% of galaxies in our sample show significant projected spatial offsets (|ΔLyα−UV|), we find a modest average offset of 0.61±0.08 kpc. A small fraction of our sample, ~10%, exhibits offsets of 2-4 kpc, sizes that are larger than the effective radii of typical galaxies at these redshifts.
    - UV越亮的星系offset越大，而且不像是merger导致的，更可能是星系内部过程的影响
    - 对未来的光谱follow up可能有一定的影响，可能产生slit loss

- [Clues on the history of early-type galaxies from SDSS spectra and GALEX photometry](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.01317)
    - **Relevant**:
    - We use a new version of the STARLIGHT spectral synthesis code and state-of-the-art stellar population models to simultaneously fit SDSS spectra and GALEX photometry for a sample of 3453 z<0.1 galaxies with NUV−r>5 and classified as elliptical by Galaxy Zoo.
    - 能够通过常规的恒星形成历史重现出80% FUV的UV-upturn，不需要如双星或者水平支恒星来解释
    - Stellar populations younger than 1Gyr are required to reproduce the ultraviolet emission in 17 per cent of our sample.
    - Emission line ratios and WHα indicate that the ionising source in these systems is a mixture of young and old stellar populations.

- [The VIMOS Ultra-Deep Survey: the Lyα emission line morphology at 2<z<6](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.01322)
    - The line emitters in our sample are classified as ~45% coincident, ~24% extended and ~11% offset emitters. For galaxies with detected UV continuum, we show that extended Lyα emitters (LAEs) correspond to the highest equivalent width galaxies
    - We also find that galaxies with larger UV-sizes have lower fractions of Lyα emitters.

- [Spatially offset black holes in the Horizon-AGN simulation and comparison to observations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.01353)
    - i) the fraction of spatially offset BHs increases with cosmic time, ii) BHs live on prograde orbits in the plane of the galaxy with an orbital radius that decays with time but stalls near z=0, and iii) the magnitudes of offsets from the galaxy centres are substantially larger in the simulation than in observations.
    - The stalling of the infall and excessive offset magnitudes to the fact that dynamical friction from stars and dark matter is not modelled in the simulation, and hence provide a way to improve the black hole dynamics of future simulations.

### July 5

- [Joint galaxy-galaxy lensing and clustering constraints on galaxy formation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.01889)
    - **Important, Relevant**
    - 比较SAM和TNG300，TNG100对g-g lensing和clustering的预测，并合观测比较
    - Henriques+15 SAM需要降低satellites的并合时标，并且降低radio-mode AGN feedback的效率，才能比较好的重现观测
    - Turning to the hydrodynamical simulation, TNG300 produces good lensing predictions, both for stellar mass-only, and locally brightest galaxies samples
    - We find that both the SAMs and TNG300 predict ∼50% excessive lensing signals for intermediate mass red galaxies with 10.2< log10M∗[M⊙] < 11.2 at r≈0.6h−1Mpc, which require further theoretical development.

- [The miniJPAS survey: a preview of the Universe in 56 colours](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.01910)
    - **Relevant, Useful** Public data available
    - To demonstrate the scientific potential of J-PAS, with the JPAS-Pathfinder camera we carried out a survey on the AEGIS field (along the Extended Groth Strip), dubbed miniJPAS. 1 deg^2巡天
    - The data surpass the target depths originally planned for J-PAS, reaching magAB between ∼22 and 23.5 for the NB filters and up to 24 for the BB filters (5σ in a 3~arcsec aperture).
    - Photometric redshifts reach subpercent precision for all sources up to r=22.5, and a precision of ∼0.3% for about half of the sample.

    - We aim at exploring the streaming flow of galaxies onto groups using observational peculiar velocity data. 利用 Cosmicflows-3 catalog 数据
    - We determine the infalling velocity field onto galaxy groups with cz < 0.033 using peculiar velocity data
    - Well beyond the group virial radius, the surrounding large-scale galaxy overdensity may impose additional infalling streaming amplitudes in the range 200 to 400 km s−1

- [Probing Dark Low Mass Halos and Primordial Black Holes with Frequency Dependent Gravitational Lensing Dispersions of Gravitational Waves](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.01936)
    - We explore the possibility of using amplitude and phase fluctuations of gravitational waves due to gravitational lensing as a probe of the small-scale matter power spectrum
    - We first study the small-scale behavior of the matter power spectrum in detail taking the so-called halo model approach including effects of baryons and subhalos. We find that the matter power spectrum at the wavenumber k∼10^6hMpc−1 is mainly determined by the abundance of dark low mass halos with mass 1h−1M⊙≲M≲10^4h−1M⊙ and is relatively insensitive to baryonic effects.
    - We also find that Primordial Black Holes (PBHs) with MPBH≳0.1 M⊙ can significantly enhance the matter power spectrum at k≳10^5hMpc−1

- [A Distant Fast Radio Burst Associated to its Host Galaxy with the Very Large Array](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.02155)
    - 利用VLA的realfast系统：present the discovery and subarcsecond localization of a new Fast Radio Burst
    - DM值是有定位的FRB里最高的，而且 its measured burst fluence of 0.6 Jy ms is less than nearly all other FRBs
    - 在观测时间内不重现;  The two putative host galaxies have similar photometric redshifts of zphot ∼ 0.6, but different colors and stellar masses

    - **Relevant**
    - 中心和Shell上的光谱：We show that both regions have similarly extended star formation histories although with different stellar population properties
    - The central region of NGC 474 is dominated by intermediate-aged stars (8.3 \pm 0.3 Gyr) with subsolar metallicity ([Z/H]= -0.24 \pm 0.07 dex) Shell上要更年轻一点，而且金属丰度更高
    - Shell产生于Major merger

- [Discovery of diffuse optical emission lines from the inner Galaxy: Evidence for LI(N)ER-like gas](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.01872)
    - **Interesting**
    - Using the Wisconsin H-Alpha Mapper, we detect optical line emission in low-extinction windows within eight degrees of Galactic Center.
    - The emission is associated with the 1.5-kiloparsec-radius "Tilted Disk" of neutral gas. 发射线ratio符合LINER特征

- [The Effect of Bars on the Ionized ISM: Optical Emission Lines from Milky Way Analogs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.01874)
    - **Interesting** Very nice visualization
    - MaNGA IFU data中看正向类似银河的盘星系，分成有棒和无棒的类型

    - **Interesting**
    - 考察在星团形成过程中恒星加热反馈对IMF shape的影响
    - MHD AMR模拟，三种对气体加热过程的不同考虑：1) a polytropic equation of state (EOS), 2) a spherically symmetric stellar heating feedback, and 3) our newly developed polar heating model that takes into account the geometry of the accretion disc and the resulting shielding of stellar radiation by dust. 加热对IMF影响很大
    - We find that the simulations with the polar heating model achieve the best convergence on the observed IMF.

- [Ubiquitous velocity fluctuations throughout the molecular interstellar medium](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.01877)
    - **Interesting**
    - 银河系和NGC4321中分子气体从0.1-1000 pc尺度上的观测：We detect ubiquitous velocity fluctuations across all spatial scales and galactic environments
    - We discover oscillatory gas flows with wavelengths ranging from 0.3−400 pc. These flows are coupled to regularly-spaced density enhancements that likely form via gravitational instabilities.
    - We also identify stochastic and scale-free velocity and density fluctuations, consistent with the structure generated in turbulent flows.

- [The MUSE Hubble Ultra Deep Field Survey: XV. The mean rest-UV spectra of Ly-alpha emitters at z>3](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.01878)
    - z>3的低恒星质量LAE的MUSE观测：We successfully observe the OIII]1666 and CIII]909 collisionally excited emission lines and the HeII1640 recombination feature, as well as the resonant CIV1550 doublet either in emission or P-Cygni.
    - LAE的恒星质量越低，Lya等值宽度越高，UV连续谱越蓝，UV光度越低，则nebular发射线的强度越高
    - 发射线比值与近邻贫金属星系类似; This suggests that weak UV features are likely ubiquitous in high z, low-mass and faint LAEs.

- [Measuring the total infrared light from galaxy clusters at z=0.5-1.6: connecting stellar populations to dusty star formation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.01880)
    - **Relevant**
    - We present ``total light" stacking techniques spanning 3.4-500{\mu}m aimed at revealing the total cluster IR emission, including low mass members and potential intracluster dust.
    - The near-IR radial profiles are well described by an NFW model with a high (c~7) concentration parameter. Dust emission is similarly concentrated, albeit suppressed at small radii (r<0.2Mpc).
    - We derive total stellar masses consistent with the theoretical Mhalo-M_star relation and specific-star formation rates that evolve strongly with redshift, echoing that of massive (log Mstar/Msun>10) cluster galaxies.
    - 大部分的FIR发射都来自小质量星系

- [Submillimetre galaxies in cosmological hydrodynamical simulations -- an opportunity for constraining feedback models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.01885)
    - **Interesting**
    - 基于TNG模拟和简单模型预测SMG流量和number counts: TNG严重低估了SMG数量，Illustris倒是符合得还可以
    - TNG中SMG少的原因：high-mass (M⋆∼10^11M⊙) z∼2−3 galaxies have lower dust masses and star formation rates (SFRs) than in Illustris owing to differences in the sub-grid models for stellar or/and active galactic nucleus (AGN) feedback
    - 未来可以考虑用SMG来限制Simulation里的模型

    - The Mg∼−12 dip of compact groups may imply that frequent galaxy-galaxy interactions would affect the evolution of galaxies

- [Quasars at intermediate redshift are not special; but they are often satellites](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.02612)
    - We find that the probability of a galaxy hosting a QSO is independent of the host dark matter halo mass of the galaxy. We also find that about 60\% of eBOSS QSOs are hosted by LRGs and about 20-40\% of QSOs are hosted by satellite galaxies.
    - QSOs should be hosted by a very broad distribution of haloes, and their occurrence should be modulated only by the efficiency of galaxy formation processes.

- [Euclid preparation: VIII. The Complete Calibration of the Colour-Redshift Relation survey: VLT/KMOS observations and data release](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.02631)

    - VLT KMOS观测之前光谱SOM里面比较空的cell，424个 1.3< z <2.5的红移；The newly determined z fill 55% of high and 35% of lower priority empty SOM grid cells.
    - We combine the results obtained from the spectra with those derived via SED fitting, and we show that the spectroscopic failures come from either weakly star-forming galaxies (at z<1.7, i.e. in the H-band) or low S/N spectra (in the K-band) of z>2 galaxies.

    - We quantify any potential effect of the MST (Mass-Sheet Transfer) with flexible mass models that are maximally degenerate with H0
    - We apply the method to the TDCOSMO sample of 7 lenses (6 from H0LiCOW) and measure H0=74.5+5.6−6.1 km s−1Mpc−1.
    - 加入SLACS样本去限制透镜质量轮廓：For 9 of the SLAC lenses we use resolved kinematics to constrain the stellar anisotropy. From the joint analysis of the TDCOSMO+SLACS sample, we measure H0=67.4+4.1−3.2 km s−1Mpc−1 这里是假设TDCOSMO星系和SLACS来自同一个母样本

    - **SSST, Interesting**
    - We describe a new tiling algorithm that can naturally deal with the large target density variations on the sky and which automatically handles the different exposure times of targets
    - The tiling pattern is modelled as a marked point process, which is characterised by a probability density that integrates the requirements imposed by the 4MOST survey. The optimal tilling pattern with respect to the defined model is estimated by the tiles configuration that maximises the proposed probability density.

- [The Chandra 3CR extragalactic survey at high redshift](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.02945)

- [The UV Luminosity Function of Protocluster Galaxies at z∼4: the Bright-end Excess and the Enhanced Star Formation Rate Density](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.02961)
    - g-dropout galaxies in 177 protocluster candidates (PC UVLF) at z∼4 selected in the HSC
    - PC UVLF shows a significant excess towards the bright-end. This excess can not be explained by the contribution of only active galactic nuclei, and we also find that this is more significant in higher dense regions.
    - This high value suggests that protoclusters make a non-negligible contribution to the cosmic SFRD at z∼4, as previously suggested by simulations.

- [The Sloan Digital Sky Survey Reverberation Mapping Project: Estimating Masses of Black Holes in Quasars with Single-Epoch Spectroscopy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.02963)
    - 关于RM测量：An unresolved key issue is the choice of parameter used to characterize the line width; generally, most researchers use FWHM in favor of line dispersion
    - We confirm the recent findings that, in addition to luminosity and line width, a third parameter is required to obtain accurate masses and that parameter seems to be Eddington ratio.

- [Illuminating Dark Matter Halo Density Profiles Without Subhaloes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.02964)
    - **Interesting, Important**
    - We investigate density profiles of the smooth components of host haloes by excluding mass contained within subhaloes 和包括subhalo的情况下的profile很不一样
    - Smooth profiles decline more rapidly at large radii and are not well characterised by the standard NFW profile.
    - 只考虑Smooth成分的前提下，halo质量和concentration的关系更好
    - Both smooth and standard halo profiles can be described by a generalised Einasto profile, an Einasto profile with a modified central slope, with smaller residuals than either an NFW or Einasto profile.

    - Over our mass range of 10^10.6-10^11.5 Msun, the incidence of radio activity is weakly dependent on stellar mass and independent of stellar age, while radio luminosity depends strongly on stellar mass.
    - 有射电活动的几率和星族年龄关系特别大：越年轻的几率越高，而且高很多
    - The age trend reflects a peak in available fueling rather than feedback from the central black hole on the surrounding galaxy.

- [CHANG-ES XXI. Transport processes and the X-shaped magnetic field of NGC 4217: off-center superbubble structure](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.03002)
    - NGC 4217 shows a large-scale X-shaped magnetic field structure, covering a major part of the galaxy with a mean total magnetic field strength in the disk of 9 micro Gauss (via equipartition).
    - Radio+X-ray观测：we found that the direction of the disk magnetic field is pointing inward. A helical outflow structure is furthermore present in the northwestern part of the galaxy, which is extended nearly 7 kpc into the halo.
    - More polarized emission is observed on the approaching side of the galaxy.

### July 8

- [The Past History of Galaxy Clusters told by their present neighbors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.03695)
    - **Relevant**
    - This paper presents a mass-free correlation between the present neighbor distribution of cluster-size halos and the latter mass assembly history.
    - The number of neighbors at different cluster-centric distances permits discriminating between clusters with different mass accretion histories.
    - Similarly to Virgo-like halos, clusters with numerous neighbors within a distance of about 2 times their virial radius experience a transition at z~1 between an active period of mass accretion, relative to the mean, and a quiet history.

- [Determining the Hubble Constant without the Sound Horizon Scale: Measurements from CMB Lensing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.04007)
    - **Interesting**
    - We discuss how a measurement of the Hubble constant can be made from the CMB without using information from the sound horizon scale
    - We show how measurements of the CMB lensing power spectrum can be used to place interesting constraints on H0 when combined with measurements of either supernovae or galaxy weak lensing, which constrain the matter density parameter.
    - The constraints arise from the sensitivity of the CMB lensing power spectrum to the horizon scale at matter-radiation equality (in projection); this scale could have a different dependence on new physics than the sound horizon.
    - We derive an rs-independent constraint of H0=73.5±5.3 km/s/Mpc.

- [Incompleteness be damned: Inference of H0 from BBH-galaxy cross-correlations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.04271)
    - We show how the angular clustering between gravitational-wave standard sirens and galaxies with known redshifts allows an inference of the Hubble constant, regardless of whether the host galaxies of any of these sirens are present in the galaxy catalog.

- [Discovery of the optical afterglow and host galaxy of short GRB181123B at z=1.754: Implications for Delay Time Distributions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.03715)
    - The host galaxy properties of GRB181123B are typical to those of other SGRB hosts, with an inferred stellar mass of ≈1.7×10^10M⊙
    - At z=1.754, GRB181123B is the most distant secure SGRB with an optical afterglow detection, and one of only three at z>1.5.
    - Motivated by a growing number of high-z SGRBs, we explore the effects of a missing z>1.5 SGRB population among the current Swift sample on delay time distribution models. We find that log-normal models with mean delay times of ≈4−6~Gyr are consistent with the observed distribution, but can be ruled out to 95% confidence with an additional ≈1−5~ Swift SGRBs recovered at z>1.5.

- [Probing the intergalactic turbulence with fast radio bursts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.03715)
    - **Interesting**
    - Via the statistical analysis of turbulence along different sightlines toward a population of fast radio bursts (FRBs), we demonstrate that FRBs provide a unique tool to probe the intergalactic turbulence
    - We measure the structure function (SF) of dispersion measures (DMs) of FRBs to study the multi-scale electron density fluctuations induced by the intergalactic turbulence.
    - Given that the DMs of FRBs are IGM dominated, our result suggests that the intergalactic turbulence has a Kolmogorov power spectrum and an outer scale on the order of 100 Mpc.

- [A Comparison of the Stellar, CO and Dust-Continuum Emission from Three, Star-Forming HUDF Galaxies at z∼2](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.03697)
    - 大质量星系, >10^11 Msun; slightly below SFMS.
    - ALMA 1.3mm和CO线观测：We find that for all three galaxies the CO emission appears ≳30% more compact than the stellar emission.
    - For the z=1.4 and 2.7 galaxies, the dust emission is also more compact, by ≳50%, than the stellar emission
    - Most high redshift observations show more compact dust emission, likely due to the ubiquity of central starbursts at high redshift and the limited sensitivity of many of these observations.

- [The Morphology-Density relationship in 1<z<2 clusters](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.03698)
    - **Relevant, CSST**
    - 4个星系团的HST观测，StatMorph测量星系形态
    - We find that 2 out of 4 clusters (at z=1.19 and z=1.75) have an established morphology-density relationship with more than 3σ significance. 星系团里形成了很多compact buldge-dominated的星系
    - This result is more significant for low-mass galaxies with logM/M⊙⪅10.5, showing that low-mass galaxies are affected the most in clusters.

- [The Role of Stellar Feedback in the Chemical Evolution of a Low Mass Dwarf Galaxy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.03702)
    - 模拟中的恒星feedback和化学演化模型研究：We find that---for a low-metallicity, low-mass dwarf galaxy ---stellar radiation, particularly ionizing radiation and LW radiation, are important sources of stellar feedback whose effects dominate over photoelectric heating and HI radiation pressure.
    - Feedback is coupled non-linearly, and the inclusion or exclusion of each process produces non-negligible effects.

- [Massive molecular gas reservoir around the central AGN in the CARLA J1103+3449 cluster at z=1.44](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.03706)
    - We measure the molecular gas reservoir of the central region around the radio-loud AGN in the cluster CARLA J1103+3449 at z=1.44 with NOEMA.
    - We detect two CO(2-1) emission lines, both blue-shifted with respect to the AGN. Their emission corresponds to two regions, ~17 kpc south-east and ~14 kpc south-west of the AGN, not associated with galaxies. 其中有4x10^10Msun的分子气体，可能是大质量外流
    - The AGN early-type host is not yet quenched; its star formation rate is consistent with being on the main sequence of star-forming galaxies

- [Matched photometric catalogs of GALEX UV sources with Gaia DR2 and SDSS DR14 databases (GUVmatch)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.03808)
    - **Useful**
    - We have matched the ultraviolet (UV) sources in GUVcat_AIS (Bianchi et al.2017) with optical databases having similar depth and wide sky coverage.
    - The multi-band photometry is used to identify classes of astrophysical objects that are prominent in UV, to characterise the content of the GUVmatch catalogs, where stars in different evolutionary stages, QSOs, and galaxies can be separated.

- [Lower bias, lower noise CMB lensing with foreground-hardened estimators](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.04325)
    - 关于CMB lensing中的前景移除
    - We show with simulations that all of the extragalactic foregrounds in temperature can be approximated by a collection of sources with identical profiles, and that a simple bias hardening technique is effective at reducing any bias to lensing, at a minimal noise cost.

- [Information content in the redshift-space galaxy power spectrum and bispectrum](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.04340)
    - **SSST**
    - Present a Fisher information study of the statistical impact of galaxy bias and selection effects on the estimation of key cosmological parameters from galaxy redshift surveys
    - With the galaxy power spectrum alone, selection effects can deteriorate the constraints severely, especially on the linear growth rate. Adding the galaxy bispectrum helps break parameter degeneracies significantly.

- [Cosmicflows-3: The South Pole Wall](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.04414)
    - The structure, at a characteristic redshift of 12,000 km/s, has a density peak coincident with the celestial South Pole. This structure, the largest contiguous feature in the local volume and comparable to the Sloan Great Wall at half the distance, is given the name the South Pole Wall.

- [Probing the Physics of Mechanical AGN Feedback with Radial Elongations of X-ray Cavities](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.04521)
    - All the cavities in our sample are elongated along the angular (type-I) or jet directions (type-II), or nearly circular (type-III).
    - We summarize radial elongations of young cavities in hydrodynamic simulations, and find that τ¯ increases with the kinetic fraction of AGN jets

- [SRG/eROSITA uncovers the most X-ray luminous quasar at z>6](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.04735)
    - We report the discovery of X-ray emission from CFHQS J142952+544717, the most distant known radio-loud quasar at z=6.18
    - 是目前位置观测到的最亮的z>6 QSO
    - Assuming Eddington limited accretion and isotropic emission, we infer a lower limit on the mass of the supermassive black hole of ∼2×10^9M⊙.
    - The most salient feature of CFHQS J142952+544717 is its X-ray brightness relative to the optical/UV emission. We argue that it may be linked to its radio-loudness (although the object is not a blazar according to its radio properties), specifically to a contribution of inverse Compton scattering of cosmic microwave background photons off relativistic electrons in the jets.

    - We derive prolific SFRs ranging 740 - 2380M⊙yr−1 for the detected targets, consistent with LoBALs existing in an evolutionary phase associated with starburst activity
    - We detect an enhancement in both the SFRs and FIR fluxes of LoBALs compared to HiBAL and non-BAL quasars

    - 这个数据pipeline的意义：designed to enable the geographically-distributed MeerKAT Absorption Line Survey (MALS) team to collaboratively process large volumes of radio interferometric data.
    - We estimate the numbers of HI and OH absorbers per unit redshift to be n21(z∼0.18)<0.14 and nOH(z∼0.40)<0.12, respectively, and constrain the cold gas covering factor of galaxies at large impact parameters (50 kpc <ρ< 150 kpc) to be less than 0.022.

- [The SAMI -- Fornax Dwarfs Survey I: Sample, observations and the specific stellar angular momentum of dwarf elliptical galaxies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.04492)
    - **Relevant**
    - 31 low-mass (107.5< M⋆<109.5 M⊙) early-type galaxies in the Fornax cluster with the SAMI instrument.
    - We find that λR decreases towards lower stellar mass, with a corresponding increase in the proportion of slowly rotating galaxies in this regime.
    - The decrease of λR with mass in our sample dE galaxies is consistent with a similar trend seen in somewhat more massive spiral galaxies from the CALIFA survey. This suggests that the degree of dynamical heating required to produce dEs from low-mass starforming progenitors may be relatively modest,

- [Formation of compact galaxies in the Extreme-Horizon simulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.04624)
    - **Relevant**
    - The high resolution in low-density regions results in smaller-size massive galaxies at redshift z=2, in better agreement with observations compared to other simulations. This results from the improved modeling of cold gas flows accreting onto galaxies.
    -  Besides, the EH simulation forms a population of particularly compact galaxies with stellar masses of 1010−11\,M$_\sun$ that are reminiscent of observed ultracompact galaxies at z≃2.
    - They form mainly through repeated major mergers of low-mass progenitors

- [Lopsided Satellite Distributions around Isolated Host Galaxies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.04703)
    - On average, the satellites of red hosts are found preferentially close to their hosts' major axes, while the satellites of blue hosts are distributed isotropically.
    - We compute the pairwise clustering of the satellites and find a strong tendency for pairs of satellites to be located on the same side of their host, resulting in lopsided distributions. 尤其是对blue host
    - Satellites that are far from their hosts (r_p > 300 kpc) show a strong preference for being located on the same side of their hosts
