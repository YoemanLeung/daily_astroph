### July 1

- [The Variance and Covariance of Counts-in-Cells Probabilities](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.00011)
    - Counts-in-cells (CIC) measurements contain a wealth of cosmological information yet are seldom used to constrain theories
    - We derive explicit formulae that accurately predict the variance and covariance among subvolumes of a simulated galaxy catalog, opening the door to the use of CIC measurements for cosmological parameter estimation.

- [Suppressed heat conductivity in the intracluster medium: implications for the magneto-thermal instability](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.00018)
    - ICM外围温度随半径下降。这个区域的等离子体基本没有碰撞，容易产生Magneto-Thermal Instability (MTI)，可以提供扰动，产生压力来支撑ICM。
    - In this paper we investigate the influence of reduced heat transport on the nonlinear evolution of the MTI by employing a subgrid model that mimics the influence of the mirror instability on the heat conductivity.

- [Deep Learning for Strong Lensing Search: Tests of the Convolutional Neural Networks and New Candidates from KiDS DR3](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.00188)
    - 用CNN找SL：We build two sets of training samples, one fully from simulations, and the other one using the LRG stamps from KiDS observations as the foreground lens images.
    - With the former training sample, we find 48 high probability candidates after human-inspection, and among them, 27 are newly identified. Using the latter training set, about 67\% of the aforementioned 48 candidates are also found, and there are 11 more new strong lensing candidates identified

- [Large Scale Structure Reconstruction with Short-Wavelength Modes: Halo Bias and Light Cone Formalism](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.00226)
    - We propose a method of indirectly measuring large scale structure using information from small scale perturbations
    - The idea is to build a quadratic estimator from small scale modes that provides a map of structure on large scales.
    - Here we generalize the theory to the case of a light-cone with halo bias and redshift space distortions taken into consideration.

- [Constraining the masses of high-redshift clusters with weak lensing: Revised shape calibration testing for the impact of stronger shears and increased blending](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.00386)
    - **Relevant**
    - We studied the impact of increased blending and light contamination from cluster and foreground galaxies, finding it negligible for z>0.7 clusters, whereas there is an effect at the ∼1% level for lower redshift clusters.
    - Our pipeline is calibrated to an accuracy of ∼0.015, which is fully sufficient for current and near-future weak lensing studies of high-redshift clusters.

- [The role of galactic dynamics in shaping the physical properties of giant molecular clouds in Milky Way-like galaxies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.00006)
    - AREPO模拟银河系，包括了80000多大质量分子云，大量HII区
    - The simulated molecular clouds are highly overdense (∼100×) and over-pressured (∼25×) relative to the ambient interstellar medium.
    - The clouds display clear, statistically-significant correlations of their rotational properties with the rates of galactic shearing and gravitational free-fall.

- [Supermassive black hole fueling in IllustrisTNG: Impact of environment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.00014)
    - TNG中的AGN环境：About ∼10% and ∼1% of them live in pairs and multiples, respectively, within 0.1 h−1Mpc scales.
    - We find that BH systems have enhanced likelihood (up to factors of 3-6) of containing high Eddington ratio (η≳0.7) AGN compared to random pairs and multiples. Conversely, the likelihood of an AGN to live in 0.1h−1Mpc scale systems is also higher (by factors ∼4 for η≳0.7) compared to random pairs and multiples.
    - We also estimate that ∼10% of ultra-hard X-ray selected AGN in TNG100 have detectable 2-10 keV AGN companions on 0.1 h−1Mpc scales 和观测相符合

- [The relationship between fine galaxy stellar morphology and star formation activity in cosmological simulations: a deep learning view](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.00039)
    - We propose an unsupervised deep learning approach to perform a stringent test of the fine morphological structure of galaxies coming from the Illustris and IllustrisTNG (TNG100 and TNG50) simulations against observations
    - We adopt a strategy that combines the output of two PixelCNN networks in a metric that isolates the fine morphological details of galaxies from the sky background. We are able to \emph{quantitatively} identify the improvements of IllustrisTNG, particularly in the high-resolution TNG50 run, over the original Illustris. 但精细形态上TNG和SDSS依然不同

- [The Energetics of Launching the Most Powerful Jets in Quasars: A Study of 3C82](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.00170)
    - 3C 82 belongs to the class of compact steep spectrum radio sources.
    - The first high signal to noise optical spectroscopic observation obtained of this object indicates that there is a powerful high ionization broad line wind with a kinetic power ∼10^45ergs/sec and a velocity ∼0.01c

- [A new estimator of resolved molecular gas in nearby galaxies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.00174)
    - We explore this correlation on kiloparsec scales with CO(1-0) maps from EDGE-CALIFA matched in resolution to WISE 12μm images.
    - We find strong CO-12μm correlations within each galaxy (median Pearson r=0.85) and we show that the scatter in the global CO-12μm correlation is largely driven by differences from galaxy to galaxy.
    - 能用12micron数据结合星系性质预测H2气体密度；with an average predictive accuracy of 0.19 dex per pixel, and intrinsic scatter of 0.17 dex.

- [Resolved Multi-element Stellar Chemical Abundances in the Brightest Quiescent Galaxy at z ∼ 2](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.00205)
    - **Relevant**
    - We analyze deep spectra of MRG-M0138, a lensed quiescent galaxy at z = 1.98 which is the brightest of its kind, with an H-band magnitude of 17.1
    - Taking advantage of full spectral fitting, we measure [Mg/Fe]=0.51±0.05, [Fe/H]=0.26±0.04
    - We detect no gradient in age or [Mg/Fe] and a slightly negative gradient in [Fe/H], which has a slope comparable to that seen in local early-type galaxies.

- [Infrared Telescope Facility (IRTF) spectral library II: New indices in Y, J, H, and L atmospheric windows](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.00569)
    - 谱特征指数方法：Our project investigates the sensitivity of various spectral features in the 1-5\,μm wavelength range to the physical properties of stars (Teff, [Fe/H], log g) and aims to objectively define spectral indices that can characterize the age and metallicity of unresolved stellar populations.
    - We complement the previous work in the I and K bands, reporting a new system of 14, 12, 22, and 12 indices for Y, J, H, and L atmospheric windows
    - The surface gravity is more challenging and only indices in the H and J windows are best suited for this.

- [The 2MASS redshift survey galaxy group catalogue derived from a graph-theory based friends-of-friends algorithm](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.00581)
    - **Useful**
    - 2MRS的新的Group catalog：The galaxy group catalogue is generated by using a novel, graph-theory based, modified version of the Friends-of-Friends algorithm.
    - This has resulted in a stable and robust catalogue with on-sky positions and line-of-sight distances within 0.5 Mpc and 2 Mpc, respectively

### July 2

- [x-cut Cosmic Shear: Optimally Removing Sensitivity to Baryonic and Nonlinear Physics with an Application to the Dark Energy Survey Year 1 Shear Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.00675)
    - x-cut cosmic shear, which optimally removes sensitivity to poorly modeled scales from the two-point cosmic shear signal.
    - Performing an x-cut cosmic shear analysis of the Dark Energy Survey Year 1 (DESY1) shear data, we reduce the error on S8 by 20% relative to a correlation function analysis, while showing our constraints are robust to different baryonic feedback models.

- [Probing the high-z IGM with the hyperfine transition of 3He+](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.00934)
    - The hyperfine transition of 3He+ at 3.5cm has been thought as a probe of the high-z IGM since it offers a unique insight into the evolution of the helium component of the gas, as well as potentially give an independent constraint on the 21cm signal from neutral hydrogen.
    - As the evolution of HeII is determined by stars, we find that it is not possible to distinguish reionization histories driven by more energetic sources.
    - On the other hand, while a bright QSO produces a signal in 21cm that is very similar to the one from a large collection of galaxies, its signature in 3.5cm is very peculiar and could be a powerful probe to identify the presence of the QSO

- [Iron in X-COP: tracing enrichment in cluster outskirts with high accuracy abundance profiles](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.01084)
    - **Relevant, Interesting**
    - 大质量星系团到R500的金属丰度轮廓，发现到外围还是变平
    - We find no evidence of segregation between cool-core and non-cool-core systems beyond ∼0.3R500；说明Cool core不影响整体性质
    - Our mean abundance within R500 shows a very modest scatter, <15%, suggesting the enrichment process must be quite similar in all these massive systems.
    - By combing ICM with stellar measurements we have found the amount of Fe diffused in the ICM to be about ten times higher than that locked in stars

- [Inverse stellar population age gradients of post-starburst galaxies at z=0.8 with LEGA-C](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.00663)
    - 基于Lick index
    - PSB galaxies have radially decreasing HδA and increasing Fe4383 profiles. In contrast, a control sample of quiescent, non-PSB galaxies
    - A two-SSP model suggests intrinsic gradients are as strong as observed in local PSB galaxies
    - At z≈0.8, central starbursts are often the result of gas-rich mergers, as evidenced by the high fraction of PSB galaxies with disturbed morphologies and tidal features (40%)

- [The Velocity Dispersion Function for Quiescent Galaxies in Nine Strong-Lensing Clusters](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.00679)
    - **Relevant**
    - We construct the velocity dispersion functions for quiescent galaxies with Dn4000>1.5 and within R200. The cluster velocity dispersion functions all show excesses at σ≳250kms−1 compared to the field velocity dispersion function.
    - The velocity dispersion function slope at large velocity dispersion (σ>160kms−1) is steeper for more massive clusters

- [Role of cosmic rays in the early stages of galactic outflows](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.00696)
    - we show that CRs do not have any noticeable effect on the mass loading by the outflow. We find that CRs can reduce the size of the outflow, which contradicts previous claims of efficient dynamical impact of CRs; however, it is consistent with earlier theoretical models of cosmic ray driven blastwave as well as stellar wind.

- [Keck Cosmic Web Imager (KCWI) Spectra of Globular Clusters and Ultra Compact Dwarfs in the Halo of M87](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.00739)
    - **Relevant**
    - We find evidence for a dual stellar population in the M87 halo light, i.e an ∼80\% component by mass which is old and metal-rich and a ∼20\% component which is old but metal-poor.
    - UCD星族相对年轻，our findings are consistent with the scenario that UCDs are the remnant nucleus of a stripped galaxy
    - 恒星速度弥散度在外围下降：We further investigate the discrepancy in the literature for M87's kinematics at large radii, favouring a declining velocity dispersion profile.

- [The structure of stellar disks in isolated lenticular galaxies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.01129)
    - 42 isolated lenticular galaxies
    - We noted a prominent difference between stellar disks of S0s galaxies in quite rarefied environments and in clusters: it is only in sparse environments that Type II disks, with profile truncations, can be found.

- [VALES VI: ISM enrichment in star-forming galaxies up to z∼0.2 using 12CO(1-0), 13CO(1-0) and C18O(1-0) line luminosity ratios](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.01182)
    - ALMA观测27个低红移SFG: Galaxies with evidences of possible merging activity tend to show higher L′(12CO)/L′(13CO) ratios by a factor of two, while variations of this order are also found in galaxy samples with higher star formation rates or star formation efficiencies

- [Testing the accuracy of 3D-HST photometric redshift estimates as reference samples for deep weak lensing studies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.01211)
    - Through the comparison to spectroscopic redshifts and photo-zs based on very deep data from the Hubble Ultra Deep Field, we identify catastrophic redshift outliers in the 3D-HST/CANDELS catalogue.
    - We investigate the cause of these outliers and demonstrate that the interpolation of spectral energy distribution (SED) templates and a well-selected combination of photometric data can reduce the net impact for weak lensing studies.

- [MeerKAT-16 HI observation of the dIrr galaxy WLM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.01292)
    - 16 dishes Meerkast观测；运动学建模；有non-circular运动的成分
    - We model the mass distribution of WLM with a pseudo-isothermal (ISO) and a Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) dark matter halo models.

### July 5

- [TDCOSMO III: Dark matter substructure meets dark energy -- the effects of (sub)halos on strong-lensing measurements of H0](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.01308)
    - 看QSO lensing测H0里面Halo sub-structure带来的影响：We base the mock lenses on six quadruply-imaged quasars that have delivered measurements of the Hubble constant, and quantify the additional uncertainties and/or bias on a lens-by-lens basis.
    - 不会bias H0测量，但会增加误差

- [Impact of Relativistic Effects on the Primordial Non-Gaussianity Signature in the Large-Scale Clustering of Quasars](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.01802)
    - **SSST**
    - Relativistic effects in clustering observations have been shown to introduce scale-dependent corrections to the galaxy over-density field on large scales, which may hamper the detection of primordial non-Gaussianity fNL through the scale-dependent halo bias.
    - Although one could mitigate the impact on the fNL signature by adjusting the redshift range or the luminosity threshold of the tracer sample being considered, we suggest that, for future surveys probing large cosmic volumes, relativistic corrections should be forward modelled from the tracer luminosity function including its uncertainties.

- [KiDS-1000 Methodology: Modelling and inference for joint weak gravitational lensing and spectroscopic galaxy clustering analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.01844)
    - A joint cosmological analysis of weak gravitational lensing from the fourth data release of the ESO Kilo-Degree Survey (KiDS-1000) and galaxy clustering from the partially overlapping BOSS and 2dFLenS surveys
    - All weak lensing signals are measured consistently via Fourier-space statistics that are insensitive to the survey mask and display low levels of mode mixing
    - Compared to the previous KiDS analyses, S8 constraints are expected to improve by 20% for weak lensing alone and by 29% for the joint analysis.

- [KiDS-1000 catalogue: weak gravitational lensing shear measurements](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.01845)
    - **Useful**
    - Our `gold-sample' of galaxies, with well calibrated photometric redshift distributions, consists of 21 million galaxies with an effective number density of ∼6.2 galaxies per square arcminute.
    - PSF residuals are detected in the highest-redshift bins, originating from object selection and/or weight bias

- [Testing KiDS cross-correlation redshifts with simulations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.01846)
    - We quantify the performance of the clustering redshifts by comparing the cross-correlation results with the true redshift distributions in each of the five KiDS photometric redshift bins
    - Clustering mean redshifts are unbiased at |Δz|<0.006 under these conditions. The redshift evolution of the galaxy bias can be reliably mitigated at this level of precision using auto-correlation measurements and self-consistency relations
    - 但是还是需要对什么才是真正的红移分布格外小心

- [X-ray Properties of Young Radio Quasars at z > 4.5](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.01342)
    - Chandra X-ray observations of 15 young radio quasars at redshifts 4.5<z<5.0
    - Rest-frame radio and X-ray luminosities are established for the sample, and a correlation between the luminosities is detected. 类星体能谱在很宽一段红移范围内都没有演化

- [Statistical Microlensing Toward Magnified High-Redshift Star Clusters](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.01301)
    - We study light variability of gravitationally magnified high-redshift star clusters induced by a foreground population of microlenses.
    - The light curve resembles a scale-invariant, Gaussian process on timescales of years to decades, while exhibits rapid and frequent micro-caustic crossing flares of larger amplitudes on timescales of days to months.
    - 结合最近发现的Suburst arc里的星团进行讨论，认为JWST观测可以探测到预计的1-2%的光变幅度
    - Given the typical surface density of intracluster stars, we expect this phenomenon to be relevant for many other gravitationally magnified star clusters at Cosmic Noon behind galaxy cluster lenses.

- [On the relation between mini-halos and AGN feedback in clusters of galaxies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.01306)
    - 关于Cool-core星系团中心的射点mini-halo：we confirmed the mini-halo in the massive strong cool core cluster PKS 0745−191 (z=0.1028) and discovered one in the massive cool core cluster MACS J1447.4+0827 (z=0.3755)
    - We find evidence of strong, previously unknown correlations between mini-halo radio power and X-ray cavity power, and between mini-halo and the central galaxy radio power related to the relativistic jets when spectrally decomposing the AGN radio emission into a component for past outbursts and one for on-going accretion.
    - AGN feedback may therefore not only play a vital role in offsetting cooling in cool core clusters, but may also play a fundamental role in re-energizing non-thermal particles in clusters.

- [The Size and Pervasiveness of Lyα-UV Spatial Offsets in Star-Forming Galaxies at z∼6](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.01310)
    - 高红移星系的rest-frame UV和Lya发射中心有时不重合：While we find that ~40% of galaxies in our sample show significant projected spatial offsets (|ΔLyα−UV|), we find a modest average offset of 0.61±0.08 kpc. A small fraction of our sample, ~10%, exhibits offsets of 2-4 kpc, sizes that are larger than the effective radii of typical galaxies at these redshifts.
    - UV越亮的星系offset越大，而且不像是merger导致的，更可能是星系内部过程的影响
    - 对未来的光谱follow up可能有一定的影响，可能产生slit loss

- [Clues on the history of early-type galaxies from SDSS spectra and GALEX photometry](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.01317)
    - **Relevant**: 
    - We use a new version of the STARLIGHT spectral synthesis code and state-of-the-art stellar population models to simultaneously fit SDSS spectra and GALEX photometry for a sample of 3453 z<0.1 galaxies with NUV−r>5 and classified as elliptical by Galaxy Zoo.
