### July 1

- [The Variance and Covariance of Counts-in-Cells Probabilities](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.00011)
    - Counts-in-cells (CIC) measurements contain a wealth of cosmological information yet are seldom used to constrain theories
    - We derive explicit formulae that accurately predict the variance and covariance among subvolumes of a simulated galaxy catalog, opening the door to the use of CIC measurements for cosmological parameter estimation.

- [Suppressed heat conductivity in the intracluster medium: implications for the magneto-thermal instability](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.00018)
    - ICM外围温度随半径下降。这个区域的等离子体基本没有碰撞，容易产生Magneto-Thermal Instability (MTI)，可以提供扰动，产生压力来支撑ICM。
    - In this paper we investigate the influence of reduced heat transport on the nonlinear evolution of the MTI by employing a subgrid model that mimics the influence of the mirror instability on the heat conductivity.

- [Deep Learning for Strong Lensing Search: Tests of the Convolutional Neural Networks and New Candidates from KiDS DR3](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.00188)
    - 用CNN找SL：We build two sets of training samples, one fully from simulations, and the other one using the LRG stamps from KiDS observations as the foreground lens images.
    - With the former training sample, we find 48 high probability candidates after human-inspection, and among them, 27 are newly identified. Using the latter training set, about 67\% of the aforementioned 48 candidates are also found, and there are 11 more new strong lensing candidates identified

- [Large Scale Structure Reconstruction with Short-Wavelength Modes: Halo Bias and Light Cone Formalism](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.00226)
    - We propose a method of indirectly measuring large scale structure using information from small scale perturbations
    - The idea is to build a quadratic estimator from small scale modes that provides a map of structure on large scales.
    - Here we generalize the theory to the case of a light-cone with halo bias and redshift space distortions taken into consideration.

- [Constraining the masses of high-redshift clusters with weak lensing: Revised shape calibration testing for the impact of stronger shears and increased blending](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.00386)
    - **Relevant**
    - We studied the impact of increased blending and light contamination from cluster and foreground galaxies, finding it negligible for z>0.7 clusters, whereas there is an effect at the ∼1% level for lower redshift clusters.
    - Our pipeline is calibrated to an accuracy of ∼0.015, which is fully sufficient for current and near-future weak lensing studies of high-redshift clusters.

- [The role of galactic dynamics in shaping the physical properties of giant molecular clouds in Milky Way-like galaxies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.00006)
    - AREPO模拟银河系，包括了80000多大质量分子云，大量HII区
    - The simulated molecular clouds are highly overdense (∼100×) and over-pressured (∼25×) relative to the ambient interstellar medium.
    - The clouds display clear, statistically-significant correlations of their rotational properties with the rates of galactic shearing and gravitational free-fall.

- [Supermassive black hole fueling in IllustrisTNG: Impact of environment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.00014)
    - TNG中的AGN环境：About ∼10% and ∼1% of them live in pairs and multiples, respectively, within 0.1 h−1Mpc scales.
    - We find that BH systems have enhanced likelihood (up to factors of 3-6) of containing high Eddington ratio (η≳0.7) AGN compared to random pairs and multiples. Conversely, the likelihood of an AGN to live in 0.1h−1Mpc scale systems is also higher (by factors ∼4 for η≳0.7) compared to random pairs and multiples.
    - We also estimate that ∼10% of ultra-hard X-ray selected AGN in TNG100 have detectable 2-10 keV AGN companions on 0.1 h−1Mpc scales 和观测相符合

- [The relationship between fine galaxy stellar morphology and star formation activity in cosmological simulations: a deep learning view](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.00039)
    - We propose an unsupervised deep learning approach to perform a stringent test of the fine morphological structure of galaxies coming from the Illustris and IllustrisTNG (TNG100 and TNG50) simulations against observations
    - We adopt a strategy that combines the output of two PixelCNN networks in a metric that isolates the fine morphological details of galaxies from the sky background. We are able to \emph{quantitatively} identify the improvements of IllustrisTNG, particularly in the high-resolution TNG50 run, over the original Illustris. 但精细形态上TNG和SDSS依然不同

- [The Energetics of Launching the Most Powerful Jets in Quasars: A Study of 3C82](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.00170)
    - 3C 82 belongs to the class of compact steep spectrum radio sources.
    - The first high signal to noise optical spectroscopic observation obtained of this object indicates that there is a powerful high ionization broad line wind with a kinetic power ∼10^45ergs/sec and a velocity ∼0.01c

- [A new estimator of resolved molecular gas in nearby galaxies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.00174)
    - We explore this correlation on kiloparsec scales with CO(1-0) maps from EDGE-CALIFA matched in resolution to WISE 12μm images.
    - We find strong CO-12μm correlations within each galaxy (median Pearson r=0.85) and we show that the scatter in the global CO-12μm correlation is largely driven by differences from galaxy to galaxy.
    - 能用12micron数据结合星系性质预测H2气体密度；with an average predictive accuracy of 0.19 dex per pixel, and intrinsic scatter of 0.17 dex.

- [Resolved Multi-element Stellar Chemical Abundances in the Brightest Quiescent Galaxy at z ∼ 2](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.00205)
    - **Relevant**
    - We analyze deep spectra of MRG-M0138, a lensed quiescent galaxy at z = 1.98 which is the brightest of its kind, with an H-band magnitude of 17.1
    - Taking advantage of full spectral fitting, we measure [Mg/Fe]=0.51±0.05, [Fe/H]=0.26±0.04
    - We detect no gradient in age or [Mg/Fe] and a slightly negative gradient in [Fe/H], which has a slope comparable to that seen in local early-type galaxies.

- [Infrared Telescope Facility (IRTF) spectral library II: New indices in Y, J, H, and L atmospheric windows](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.00569)
    - 谱特征指数方法：Our project investigates the sensitivity of various spectral features in the 1-5\,μm wavelength range to the physical properties of stars (Teff, [Fe/H], log g) and aims to objectively define spectral indices that can characterize the age and metallicity of unresolved stellar populations.
    - We complement the previous work in the I and K bands, reporting a new system of 14, 12, 22, and 12 indices for Y, J, H, and L atmospheric windows
    - The surface gravity is more challenging and only indices in the H and J windows are best suited for this.

- [The 2MASS redshift survey galaxy group catalogue derived from a graph-theory based friends-of-friends algorithm](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.00581)
    - **Useful**
    - 2MRS的新的Group catalog：The galaxy group catalogue is generated by using a novel, graph-theory based, modified version of the Friends-of-Friends algorithm.
    - This has resulted in a stable and robust catalogue with on-sky positions and line-of-sight distances within 0.5 Mpc and 2 Mpc, respectively

### July 2

- [x-cut Cosmic Shear: Optimally Removing Sensitivity to Baryonic and Nonlinear Physics with an Application to the Dark Energy Survey Year 1 Shear Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.00675)
    - x-cut cosmic shear, which optimally removes sensitivity to poorly modeled scales from the two-point cosmic shear signal.
    - Performing an x-cut cosmic shear analysis of the Dark Energy Survey Year 1 (DESY1) shear data, we reduce the error on S8 by 20% relative to a correlation function analysis, while showing our constraints are robust to different baryonic feedback models.

- [Probing the high-z IGM with the hyperfine transition of 3He+](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.00934)
    - The hyperfine transition of 3He+ at 3.5cm has been thought as a probe of the high-z IGM since it offers a unique insight into the evolution of the helium component of the gas, as well as potentially give an independent constraint on the 21cm signal from neutral hydrogen.
    - As the evolution of HeII is determined by stars, we find that it is not possible to distinguish reionization histories driven by more energetic sources.
    - On the other hand, while a bright QSO produces a signal in 21cm that is very similar to the one from a large collection of galaxies, its signature in 3.5cm is very peculiar and could be a powerful probe to identify the presence of the QSO

- [Iron in X-COP: tracing enrichment in cluster outskirts with high accuracy abundance profiles](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.01084)
    - **Relevant, Interesting**
    - 大质量星系团到R500的金属丰度轮廓，发现到外围还是变平
    - We find no evidence of segregation between cool-core and non-cool-core systems beyond ∼0.3R500；说明Cool core不影响整体性质
    - Our mean abundance within R500 shows a very modest scatter, <15%, suggesting the enrichment process must be quite similar in all these massive systems.
    - By combing ICM with stellar measurements we have found the amount of Fe diffused in the ICM to be about ten times higher than that locked in stars

- [Inverse stellar population age gradients of post-starburst galaxies at z=0.8 with LEGA-C](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.00663)
    - 基于Lick index
    - PSB galaxies have radially decreasing HδA and increasing Fe4383 profiles. In contrast, a control sample of quiescent, non-PSB galaxies
    - A two-SSP model suggests intrinsic gradients are as strong as observed in local PSB galaxies
    - At z≈0.8, central starbursts are often the result of gas-rich mergers, as evidenced by the high fraction of PSB galaxies with disturbed morphologies and tidal features (40%)

- [The Velocity Dispersion Function for Quiescent Galaxies in Nine Strong-Lensing Clusters](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.00679)
    - **Relevant**
    - We construct the velocity dispersion functions for quiescent galaxies with Dn4000>1.5 and within R200. The cluster velocity dispersion functions all show excesses at σ≳250kms−1 compared to the field velocity dispersion function.
    - The velocity dispersion function slope at large velocity dispersion (σ>160kms−1) is steeper for more massive clusters

- [Role of cosmic rays in the early stages of galactic outflows](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.00696)
    - we show that CRs do not have any noticeable effect on the mass loading by the outflow. We find that CRs can reduce the size of the outflow, which contradicts previous claims of efficient dynamical impact of CRs; however, it is consistent with earlier theoretical models of cosmic ray driven blastwave as well as stellar wind.

- [Keck Cosmic Web Imager (KCWI) Spectra of Globular Clusters and Ultra Compact Dwarfs in the Halo of M87](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.00739)
    - **Relevant**
    - We find evidence for a dual stellar population in the M87 halo light, i.e an ∼80\% component by mass which is old and metal-rich and a ∼20\% component which is old but metal-poor.
    - UCD星族相对年轻，our findings are consistent with the scenario that UCDs are the remnant nucleus of a stripped galaxy
    - 恒星速度弥散度在外围下降：We further investigate the discrepancy in the literature for M87's kinematics at large radii, favouring a declining velocity dispersion profile.

- [The structure of stellar disks in isolated lenticular galaxies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.01129)
    - 42 isolated lenticular galaxies
    - We noted a prominent difference between stellar disks of S0s galaxies in quite rarefied environments and in clusters: it is only in sparse environments that Type II disks, with profile truncations, can be found.

- [VALES VI: ISM enrichment in star-forming galaxies up to z∼0.2 using 12CO(1-0), 13CO(1-0) and C18O(1-0) line luminosity ratios](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.01182)
    - ALMA观测27个低红移SFG: Galaxies with evidences of possible merging activity tend to show higher L′(12CO)/L′(13CO) ratios by a factor of two, while variations of this order are also found in galaxy samples with higher star formation rates or star formation efficiencies

- [Testing the accuracy of 3D-HST photometric redshift estimates as reference samples for deep weak lensing studies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.01211)
    - Through the comparison to spectroscopic redshifts and photo-zs based on very deep data from the Hubble Ultra Deep Field, we identify catastrophic redshift outliers in the 3D-HST/CANDELS catalogue.
    - We investigate the cause of these outliers and demonstrate that the interpolation of spectral energy distribution (SED) templates and a well-selected combination of photometric data can reduce the net impact for weak lensing studies.

- [MeerKAT-16 HI observation of the dIrr galaxy WLM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.01292)
    - 16 dishes Meerkast观测；运动学建模；有non-circular运动的成分
    - We model the mass distribution of WLM with a pseudo-isothermal (ISO) and a Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) dark matter halo models.

### July 5

- [TDCOSMO III: Dark matter substructure meets dark energy -- the effects of (sub)halos on strong-lensing measurements of H0](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.01308)
    - 看QSO lensing测H0里面Halo sub-structure带来的影响：We base the mock lenses on six quadruply-imaged quasars that have delivered measurements of the Hubble constant, and quantify the additional uncertainties and/or bias on a lens-by-lens basis.
    - 不会bias H0测量，但会增加误差

- [Impact of Relativistic Effects on the Primordial Non-Gaussianity Signature in the Large-Scale Clustering of Quasars](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.01802)
    - **SSST**
    - Relativistic effects in clustering observations have been shown to introduce scale-dependent corrections to the galaxy over-density field on large scales, which may hamper the detection of primordial non-Gaussianity fNL through the scale-dependent halo bias.
    - Although one could mitigate the impact on the fNL signature by adjusting the redshift range or the luminosity threshold of the tracer sample being considered, we suggest that, for future surveys probing large cosmic volumes, relativistic corrections should be forward modelled from the tracer luminosity function including its uncertainties.

- [KiDS-1000 Methodology: Modelling and inference for joint weak gravitational lensing and spectroscopic galaxy clustering analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.01844)
    - A joint cosmological analysis of weak gravitational lensing from the fourth data release of the ESO Kilo-Degree Survey (KiDS-1000) and galaxy clustering from the partially overlapping BOSS and 2dFLenS surveys
    - All weak lensing signals are measured consistently via Fourier-space statistics that are insensitive to the survey mask and display low levels of mode mixing
    - Compared to the previous KiDS analyses, S8 constraints are expected to improve by 20% for weak lensing alone and by 29% for the joint analysis.

- [KiDS-1000 catalogue: weak gravitational lensing shear measurements](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.01845)
    - **Useful**
    - Our `gold-sample' of galaxies, with well calibrated photometric redshift distributions, consists of 21 million galaxies with an effective number density of ∼6.2 galaxies per square arcminute.
    - PSF residuals are detected in the highest-redshift bins, originating from object selection and/or weight bias

- [Testing KiDS cross-correlation redshifts with simulations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.01846)
    - We quantify the performance of the clustering redshifts by comparing the cross-correlation results with the true redshift distributions in each of the five KiDS photometric redshift bins
    - Clustering mean redshifts are unbiased at |Δz|<0.006 under these conditions. The redshift evolution of the galaxy bias can be reliably mitigated at this level of precision using auto-correlation measurements and self-consistency relations
    - 但是还是需要对什么才是真正的红移分布格外小心

- [X-ray Properties of Young Radio Quasars at z > 4.5](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.01342)
    - Chandra X-ray observations of 15 young radio quasars at redshifts 4.5<z<5.0
    - Rest-frame radio and X-ray luminosities are established for the sample, and a correlation between the luminosities is detected. 类星体能谱在很宽一段红移范围内都没有演化

- [Statistical Microlensing Toward Magnified High-Redshift Star Clusters](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.01301)
    - We study light variability of gravitationally magnified high-redshift star clusters induced by a foreground population of microlenses.
    - The light curve resembles a scale-invariant, Gaussian process on timescales of years to decades, while exhibits rapid and frequent micro-caustic crossing flares of larger amplitudes on timescales of days to months.
    - 结合最近发现的Suburst arc里的星团进行讨论，认为JWST观测可以探测到预计的1-2%的光变幅度
    - Given the typical surface density of intracluster stars, we expect this phenomenon to be relevant for many other gravitationally magnified star clusters at Cosmic Noon behind galaxy cluster lenses.

- [On the relation between mini-halos and AGN feedback in clusters of galaxies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.01306)
    - 关于Cool-core星系团中心的射点mini-halo：we confirmed the mini-halo in the massive strong cool core cluster PKS 0745−191 (z=0.1028) and discovered one in the massive cool core cluster MACS J1447.4+0827 (z=0.3755)
    - We find evidence of strong, previously unknown correlations between mini-halo radio power and X-ray cavity power, and between mini-halo and the central galaxy radio power related to the relativistic jets when spectrally decomposing the AGN radio emission into a component for past outbursts and one for on-going accretion.
    - AGN feedback may therefore not only play a vital role in offsetting cooling in cool core clusters, but may also play a fundamental role in re-energizing non-thermal particles in clusters.

- [The Size and Pervasiveness of Lyα-UV Spatial Offsets in Star-Forming Galaxies at z∼6](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.01310)
    - 高红移星系的rest-frame UV和Lya发射中心有时不重合：While we find that ~40% of galaxies in our sample show significant projected spatial offsets (|ΔLyα−UV|), we find a modest average offset of 0.61±0.08 kpc. A small fraction of our sample, ~10%, exhibits offsets of 2-4 kpc, sizes that are larger than the effective radii of typical galaxies at these redshifts.
    - UV越亮的星系offset越大，而且不像是merger导致的，更可能是星系内部过程的影响
    - 对未来的光谱follow up可能有一定的影响，可能产生slit loss

- [Clues on the history of early-type galaxies from SDSS spectra and GALEX photometry](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.01317)
    - **Relevant**:
    - We use a new version of the STARLIGHT spectral synthesis code and state-of-the-art stellar population models to simultaneously fit SDSS spectra and GALEX photometry for a sample of 3453 z<0.1 galaxies with NUV−r>5 and classified as elliptical by Galaxy Zoo.
    - 能够通过常规的恒星形成历史重现出80% FUV的UV-upturn，不需要如双星或者水平支恒星来解释
    - Stellar populations younger than 1Gyr are required to reproduce the ultraviolet emission in 17 per cent of our sample.
    - Emission line ratios and WHα indicate that the ionising source in these systems is a mixture of young and old stellar populations.

- [The VIMOS Ultra-Deep Survey: the Lyα emission line morphology at 2<z<6](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.01322)
    - The line emitters in our sample are classified as ~45% coincident, ~24% extended and ~11% offset emitters. For galaxies with detected UV continuum, we show that extended Lyα emitters (LAEs) correspond to the highest equivalent width galaxies
    - We also find that galaxies with larger UV-sizes have lower fractions of Lyα emitters.

- [Spatially offset black holes in the Horizon-AGN simulation and comparison to observations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.01353)
    - i) the fraction of spatially offset BHs increases with cosmic time, ii) BHs live on prograde orbits in the plane of the galaxy with an orbital radius that decays with time but stalls near z=0, and iii) the magnitudes of offsets from the galaxy centres are substantially larger in the simulation than in observations.
    - The stalling of the infall and excessive offset magnitudes to the fact that dynamical friction from stars and dark matter is not modelled in the simulation, and hence provide a way to improve the black hole dynamics of future simulations.

### July 5

- [Joint galaxy-galaxy lensing and clustering constraints on galaxy formation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.01889)
    - **Important, Relevant**
    - 比较SAM和TNG300，TNG100对g-g lensing和clustering的预测，并合观测比较
    - Henriques+15 SAM需要降低satellites的并合时标，并且降低radio-mode AGN feedback的效率，才能比较好的重现观测
    - Turning to the hydrodynamical simulation, TNG300 produces good lensing predictions, both for stellar mass-only, and locally brightest galaxies samples
    - We find that both the SAMs and TNG300 predict ∼50% excessive lensing signals for intermediate mass red galaxies with 10.2< log10M∗[M⊙] < 11.2 at r≈0.6h−1Mpc, which require further theoretical development.

- [The miniJPAS survey: a preview of the Universe in 56 colours](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.01910)
    - **Relevant, Useful** Public data available
    - To demonstrate the scientific potential of J-PAS, with the JPAS-Pathfinder camera we carried out a survey on the AEGIS field (along the Extended Groth Strip), dubbed miniJPAS. 1 deg^2巡天
    - The data surpass the target depths originally planned for J-PAS, reaching magAB between ∼22 and 23.5 for the NB filters and up to 24 for the BB filters (5σ in a 3~arcsec aperture).
    - Photometric redshifts reach subpercent precision for all sources up to r=22.5, and a precision of ∼0.3% for about half of the sample.

    - We aim at exploring the streaming flow of galaxies onto groups using observational peculiar velocity data. 利用 Cosmicflows-3 catalog 数据
    - We determine the infalling velocity field onto galaxy groups with cz < 0.033 using peculiar velocity data
    - Well beyond the group virial radius, the surrounding large-scale galaxy overdensity may impose additional infalling streaming amplitudes in the range 200 to 400 km s−1

- [Probing Dark Low Mass Halos and Primordial Black Holes with Frequency Dependent Gravitational Lensing Dispersions of Gravitational Waves](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.01936)
    - We explore the possibility of using amplitude and phase fluctuations of gravitational waves due to gravitational lensing as a probe of the small-scale matter power spectrum
    - We first study the small-scale behavior of the matter power spectrum in detail taking the so-called halo model approach including effects of baryons and subhalos. We find that the matter power spectrum at the wavenumber k∼10^6hMpc−1 is mainly determined by the abundance of dark low mass halos with mass 1h−1M⊙≲M≲10^4h−1M⊙ and is relatively insensitive to baryonic effects.
    - We also find that Primordial Black Holes (PBHs) with MPBH≳0.1 M⊙ can significantly enhance the matter power spectrum at k≳10^5hMpc−1

- [A Distant Fast Radio Burst Associated to its Host Galaxy with the Very Large Array](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.02155)
    - 利用VLA的realfast系统：present the discovery and subarcsecond localization of a new Fast Radio Burst
    - DM值是有定位的FRB里最高的，而且 its measured burst fluence of 0.6 Jy ms is less than nearly all other FRBs
    - 在观测时间内不重现;  The two putative host galaxies have similar photometric redshifts of zphot ∼ 0.6, but different colors and stellar masses

    - **Relevant**
    - 中心和Shell上的光谱：We show that both regions have similarly extended star formation histories although with different stellar population properties
    - The central region of NGC 474 is dominated by intermediate-aged stars (8.3 \pm 0.3 Gyr) with subsolar metallicity ([Z/H]= -0.24 \pm 0.07 dex) Shell上要更年轻一点，而且金属丰度更高
    - Shell产生于Major merger

- [Discovery of diffuse optical emission lines from the inner Galaxy: Evidence for LI(N)ER-like gas](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.01872)
    - **Interesting**
    - Using the Wisconsin H-Alpha Mapper, we detect optical line emission in low-extinction windows within eight degrees of Galactic Center.
    - The emission is associated with the 1.5-kiloparsec-radius "Tilted Disk" of neutral gas. 发射线ratio符合LINER特征

- [The Effect of Bars on the Ionized ISM: Optical Emission Lines from Milky Way Analogs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.01874)
    - **Interesting** Very nice visualization
    - MaNGA IFU data中看正向类似银河的盘星系，分成有棒和无棒的类型

    - **Interesting**
    - 考察在星团形成过程中恒星加热反馈对IMF shape的影响
    - MHD AMR模拟，三种对气体加热过程的不同考虑：1) a polytropic equation of state (EOS), 2) a spherically symmetric stellar heating feedback, and 3) our newly developed polar heating model that takes into account the geometry of the accretion disc and the resulting shielding of stellar radiation by dust. 加热对IMF影响很大
    - We find that the simulations with the polar heating model achieve the best convergence on the observed IMF.

- [Ubiquitous velocity fluctuations throughout the molecular interstellar medium](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.01877)
    - **Interesting**
    - 银河系和NGC4321中分子气体从0.1-1000 pc尺度上的观测：We detect ubiquitous velocity fluctuations across all spatial scales and galactic environments
    - We discover oscillatory gas flows with wavelengths ranging from 0.3−400 pc. These flows are coupled to regularly-spaced density enhancements that likely form via gravitational instabilities.
    - We also identify stochastic and scale-free velocity and density fluctuations, consistent with the structure generated in turbulent flows.

- [The MUSE Hubble Ultra Deep Field Survey: XV. The mean rest-UV spectra of Ly-alpha emitters at z>3](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.01878)
    - z>3的低恒星质量LAE的MUSE观测：We successfully observe the OIII]1666 and CIII]909 collisionally excited emission lines and the HeII1640 recombination feature, as well as the resonant CIV1550 doublet either in emission or P-Cygni.
    - LAE的恒星质量越低，Lya等值宽度越高，UV连续谱越蓝，UV光度越低，则nebular发射线的强度越高
    - 发射线比值与近邻贫金属星系类似; This suggests that weak UV features are likely ubiquitous in high z, low-mass and faint LAEs.

- [Measuring the total infrared light from galaxy clusters at z=0.5-1.6: connecting stellar populations to dusty star formation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.01880)
    - **Relevant**
    - We present ``total light" stacking techniques spanning 3.4-500{\mu}m aimed at revealing the total cluster IR emission, including low mass members and potential intracluster dust.
    - The near-IR radial profiles are well described by an NFW model with a high (c~7) concentration parameter. Dust emission is similarly concentrated, albeit suppressed at small radii (r<0.2Mpc).
    - We derive total stellar masses consistent with the theoretical Mhalo-M_star relation and specific-star formation rates that evolve strongly with redshift, echoing that of massive (log Mstar/Msun>10) cluster galaxies.
    - 大部分的FIR发射都来自小质量星系

- [Submillimetre galaxies in cosmological hydrodynamical simulations -- an opportunity for constraining feedback models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.01885)
    - **Interesting**
    - 基于TNG模拟和简单模型预测SMG流量和number counts: TNG严重低估了SMG数量，Illustris倒是符合得还可以
    - TNG中SMG少的原因：high-mass (M⋆∼10^11M⊙) z∼2−3 galaxies have lower dust masses and star formation rates (SFRs) than in Illustris owing to differences in the sub-grid models for stellar or/and active galactic nucleus (AGN) feedback
    - 未来可以考虑用SMG来限制Simulation里的模型

- [Quasars at intermediate redshift are not special; but they are often satellites](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.02612)
    - We find that the probability of a galaxy hosting a QSO is independent of the host dark matter halo mass of the galaxy. We also find that about 60\% of eBOSS QSOs are hosted by LRGs and about 20-40\% of QSOs are hosted by satellite galaxies.
    - QSOs should be hosted by a very broad distribution of haloes, and their occurrence should be modulated only by the efficiency of galaxy formation processes.

    - We describe a new tiling algorithm that can naturally deal with the large target density variations on the sky and which automatically handles the different exposure times of targets
    - The tiling pattern is modelled as a marked point process, which is characterised by a probability density that integrates the requirements imposed by the 4MOST survey. The optimal tilling pattern with respect to the defined model is estimated by the tiles configuration that maximises the proposed probability density.

    - g-dropout galaxies in 177 protocluster candidates (PC UVLF) at z∼4 selected in the HSC
    - PC UVLF shows a significant excess towards the bright-end. This excess can not be explained by the contribution of only active galactic nuclei, and we also find that this is more significant in higher dense regions.
    - This high value suggests that protoclusters make a non-negligible contribution to the cosmic SFRD at z∼4, as previously suggested by simulations.

- [The Sloan Digital Sky Survey Reverberation Mapping Project: Estimating Masses of Black Holes in Quasars with Single-Epoch Spectroscopy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.02963)

    - We confirm the recent findings that, in addition to luminosity and line width, a third parameter is required to obtain accurate masses and that parameter seems to be Eddington ratio.

- [Illuminating Dark Matter Halo Density Profiles Without Subhaloes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.02964)
    - **Interesting, Important**
    - We investigate density profiles of the smooth components of host haloes by excluding mass contained within subhaloes 和包括subhalo的情况下的profile很不一样
    - Smooth profiles decline more rapidly at large radii and are not well characterised by the standard NFW profile.
    - 只考虑Smooth成分的前提下，halo质量和concentration的关系更好

    - Over our mass range of 10^10.6-10^11.5 Msun, the incidence of radio activity is weakly dependent on stellar mass and independent of stellar age, while radio luminosity depends strongly on stellar mass.
    - 有射电活动的几率和星族年龄关系特别大：越年轻的几率越高，而且高很多

- [The Past History of Galaxy Clusters told by their present neighbors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.03695)
    - **Relevant**
    - This paper presents a mass-free correlation between the present neighbor distribution of cluster-size halos and the latter mass assembly history.
    - The number of neighbors at different cluster-centric distances permits discriminating between clusters with different mass accretion histories.
    - Similarly to Virgo-like halos, clusters with numerous neighbors within a distance of about 2 times their virial radius experience a transition at z~1 between an active period of mass accretion, relative to the mean, and a quiet history.

- [Determining the Hubble Constant without the Sound Horizon Scale: Measurements from CMB Lensing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.04007)
    - **Interesting**
    - We discuss how a measurement of the Hubble constant can be made from the CMB without using information from the sound horizon scale
    - We show how measurements of the CMB lensing power spectrum can be used to place interesting constraints on H0 when combined with measurements of either supernovae or galaxy weak lensing, which constrain the matter density parameter.
    - The constraints arise from the sensitivity of the CMB lensing power spectrum to the horizon scale at matter-radiation equality (in projection); this scale could have a different dependence on new physics than the sound horizon.
    - We derive an rs-independent constraint of H0=73.5±5.3 km/s/Mpc.

- [Incompleteness be damned: Inference of H0 from BBH-galaxy cross-correlations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.04271)
    - We show how the angular clustering between gravitational-wave standard sirens and galaxies with known redshifts allows an inference of the Hubble constant, regardless of whether the host galaxies of any of these sirens are present in the galaxy catalog.

- [Discovery of the optical afterglow and host galaxy of short GRB181123B at z=1.754: Implications for Delay Time Distributions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.03715)
    - The host galaxy properties of GRB181123B are typical to those of other SGRB hosts, with an inferred stellar mass of ≈1.7×10^10M⊙
    - At z=1.754, GRB181123B is the most distant secure SGRB with an optical afterglow detection, and one of only three at z>1.5.
    - Motivated by a growing number of high-z SGRBs, we explore the effects of a missing z>1.5 SGRB population among the current Swift sample on delay time distribution models. We find that log-normal models with mean delay times of ≈4−6~Gyr are consistent with the observed distribution, but can be ruled out to 95% confidence with an additional ≈1−5~ Swift SGRBs recovered at z>1.5.

- [Probing the intergalactic turbulence with fast radio bursts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.03715)
    - **Interesting**
    - Via the statistical analysis of turbulence along different sightlines toward a population of fast radio bursts (FRBs), we demonstrate that FRBs provide a unique tool to probe the intergalactic turbulence
    - We measure the structure function (SF) of dispersion measures (DMs) of FRBs to study the multi-scale electron density fluctuations induced by the intergalactic turbulence.
    - Given that the DMs of FRBs are IGM dominated, our result suggests that the intergalactic turbulence has a Kolmogorov power spectrum and an outer scale on the order of 100 Mpc.

- [A Comparison of the Stellar, CO and Dust-Continuum Emission from Three, Star-Forming HUDF Galaxies at z∼2](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.03697)
    - 大质量星系, >10^11 Msun; slightly below SFMS.
    - ALMA 1.3mm和CO线观测：We find that for all three galaxies the CO emission appears ≳30% more compact than the stellar emission.
    - For the z=1.4 and 2.7 galaxies, the dust emission is also more compact, by ≳50%, than the stellar emission
    - Most high redshift observations show more compact dust emission, likely due to the ubiquity of central starbursts at high redshift and the limited sensitivity of many of these observations.

- [The Morphology-Density relationship in 1<z<2 clusters](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.03698)
    - **Relevant, CSST**

    - We find that 2 out of 4 clusters (at z=1.19 and z=1.75) have an established morphology-density relationship with more than 3σ significance. 星系团里形成了很多compact buldge-dominated的星系
    - This result is more significant for low-mass galaxies with logM/M⊙⪅10.5, showing that low-mass galaxies are affected the most in clusters.

- [The Role of Stellar Feedback in the Chemical Evolution of a Low Mass Dwarf Galaxy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.03702)
    - 模拟中的恒星feedback和化学演化模型研究：We find that---for a low-metallicity, low-mass dwarf galaxy ---stellar radiation, particularly ionizing radiation and LW radiation, are important sources of stellar feedback whose effects dominate over photoelectric heating and HI radiation pressure.
    - Feedback is coupled non-linearly, and the inclusion or exclusion of each process produces non-negligible effects.

- [Massive molecular gas reservoir around the central AGN in the CARLA J1103+3449 cluster at z=1.44](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.03706)
    - We measure the molecular gas reservoir of the central region around the radio-loud AGN in the cluster CARLA J1103+3449 at z=1.44 with NOEMA.
    - We detect two CO(2-1) emission lines, both blue-shifted with respect to the AGN. Their emission corresponds to two regions, ~17 kpc south-east and ~14 kpc south-west of the AGN, not associated with galaxies. 其中有4x10^10Msun的分子气体，可能是大质量外流
    - The AGN early-type host is not yet quenched; its star formation rate is consistent with being on the main sequence of star-forming galaxies

- [Matched photometric catalogs of GALEX UV sources with Gaia DR2 and SDSS DR14 databases (GUVmatch)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.03808)
    - **Useful**
    - We have matched the ultraviolet (UV) sources in GUVcat_AIS (Bianchi et al.2017) with optical databases having similar depth and wide sky coverage.
    - The multi-band photometry is used to identify classes of astrophysical objects that are prominent in UV, to characterise the content of the GUVmatch catalogs, where stars in different evolutionary stages, QSOs, and galaxies can be separated.

- [Information content in the redshift-space galaxy power spectrum and bispectrum](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.04340)
    - **SSST**
    - Present a Fisher information study of the statistical impact of galaxy bias and selection effects on the estimation of key cosmological parameters from galaxy redshift surveys
    - With the galaxy power spectrum alone, selection effects can deteriorate the constraints severely, especially on the linear growth rate. Adding the galaxy bispectrum helps break parameter degeneracies significantly.

- [Cosmicflows-3: The South Pole Wall](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.04414)

    - We summarize radial elongations of young cavities in hydrodynamic simulations, and find that τ¯ increases with the kinetic fraction of AGN jets

- [SRG/eROSITA uncovers the most X-ray luminous quasar at z>6](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.04735)

    - 是目前位置观测到的最亮的z>6 QSO
    - Assuming Eddington limited accretion and isotropic emission, we infer a lower limit on the mass of the supermassive black hole of ∼2×10^9M⊙.
    - The most salient feature of CFHQS J142952+544717 is its X-ray brightness relative to the optical/UV emission. We argue that it may be linked to its radio-loudness (although the object is not a blazar according to its radio properties), specifically to a contribution of inverse Compton scattering of cosmic microwave background photons off relativistic electrons in the jets.

    - 这个数据pipeline的意义：designed to enable the geographically-distributed MeerKAT Absorption Line Survey (MALS) team to collaboratively process large volumes of radio interferometric data.
    - We estimate the numbers of HI and OH absorbers per unit redshift to be n21(z∼0.18)<0.14 and nOH(z∼0.40)<0.12, respectively, and constrain the cold gas covering factor of galaxies at large impact parameters (50 kpc <ρ< 150 kpc) to be less than 0.022.

- [The SAMI -- Fornax Dwarfs Survey I: Sample, observations and the specific stellar angular momentum of dwarf elliptical galaxies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.04492)
    - **Relevant**
    - 31 low-mass (107.5< M⋆<109.5 M⊙) early-type galaxies in the Fornax cluster with the SAMI instrument.
    - We find that λR decreases towards lower stellar mass, with a corresponding increase in the proportion of slowly rotating galaxies in this regime.
    - The decrease of λR with mass in our sample dE galaxies is consistent with a similar trend seen in somewhat more massive spiral galaxies from the CALIFA survey. This suggests that the degree of dynamical heating required to produce dEs from low-mass starforming progenitors may be relatively modest,

- [Formation of compact galaxies in the Extreme-Horizon simulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.04624)
    - **Relevant**
    - The high resolution in low-density regions results in smaller-size massive galaxies at redshift z=2, in better agreement with observations compared to other simulations. This results from the improved modeling of cold gas flows accreting onto galaxies.
    -  Besides, the EH simulation forms a population of particularly compact galaxies with stellar masses of 1010−11\,M$_\sun$ that are reminiscent of observed ultracompact galaxies at z≃2.
    - They form mainly through repeated major mergers of low-mass progenitors

- [Lopsided Satellite Distributions around Isolated Host Galaxies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.04703)

    - We compute the pairwise clustering of the satellites and find a strong tendency for pairs of satellites to be located on the same side of their host, resulting in lopsided distributions. 尤其是对blue host
    - Satellites that are far from their hosts (r_p > 300 kpc) show a strong preference for being located on the same side of their hosts

- [Joint analysis of 6dFGS and SDSS peculiar velocities for the growth rate of cosmic structure and tests of gravity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.04993)
    - **SSST**
    - Here we constrain the growth rate of structure by comparing observed Fundamental Plane peculiar velocities for 15894 galaxies from the 6dF Galaxy Survey (6dFGS) and Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) with predicted velocities and densities from the 2M++ redshift survey.
    - Our results favour values of the growth index γ>6/11 or a Hubble constant H0>70\,km\,s−1\,Mpc−1 or a fluctuation amplitude σ8<0.8 or some combination of these.
    - Imminent redshift surveys such as Taipan, DESI, WALLABY, and SKA1-MID will help to resolve this tension by measuring the growth rate of cosmic structure to 1\% in the redshift range 0< z<1.

- [A Machine Learning Approach to the Census of Galaxy Clusters](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.05144)

    - We use Class Activation Mapping to localize discriminative regions for the classification decision. From this analysis, we observe that the network has utilized regions from cluster centers out to r~300 kpc and r~500 kpc to identify CC and NCC clusters, respectively.

- [On the phase-space structure of galaxy clusters from cosmological simulations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.05199)

    - The combination of the velocity dispersion σv with the density ρ can be used to define the pseudo-entropy S(r)=σ2v/ρ2/3, whose profile is well-described by a simple power-law S∝rα.
    - We find that baryons significantly affect the inner region of pseudo-entropy profile as traced by substructures, while pseudo-entropy profiles as traced by DM particles are characterized by an almost universal behavior and can be used as a low-scatter (∼6−7%) mass-proxy.
    - we investigate the pseudo-entropy traced by the stars focusing our interest in the dynamical distinction between intracluster light (ICL) and the stars bound to the brightest cluster galaxy (BCG): the combination of these two pseudo-entropy profiles is well-described by a single power-law out to almost the entire cluster virial radius.

    - We predict that Cycle 1 JWST surveys will very likely detect galaxies with M∗>10^7M⊙ and/or M1500<−17 out to at least z∼13.5
    - Number density uncertainties at z>12 expand dramatically, so efforts to detect z>12 galaxies will provide the most valuable constraints on galaxy formation models.
    - For reionization models, extrapolating luminosity functions with a constant faint-end slope from M1500=−17 down to M1500=−12 gives the most reasonable upper limit for the total UV luminosity and cosmic star formation rate up to z∼12

    - We also find that galaxy groups are more likely than clusters to host large radio galaxies, perhaps owing to the lower ambient gas density or a more efficient accretion mode

- [On the accretion of a new group of galaxies onto Virgo: I. Internal kinematics of nine in-falling dEs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.05021)
    - MUSE观测9个2-3 Gyr前被吸积进入Virgo的矮星系: We observe a spread in the λR profiles of our sample dEs, finding that the λR profiles of half of them are as high as those of low-mass field galaxies. The remaining dEs exhibit λR profiles as low as those of Virgo dEs that were likely accreted longer ago.
    -  We suggest that the low-λR dEs in our sample were processed by their previous host halo, prior to their infall to Virgo, and that the high-λR dEs may be experiencing ram pressure stripping in Virgo.

- [Flow-Based Likelihoods for Non-Gaussian Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.05535)
    - 如何不再假设likelihood是Gaussian的情况下进行推断：we suggest using the optimization targets of flow-based generative models, a class of models that can capture complex distributions by transforming a simple base distribution through layers of nonlinearities.
    - Flow-based Likelihood (FBL): We then apply FBLs to mock weak lensing convergence power spectra, a cosmological observable that is significantly non-Gaussian (NG). We find that the FBL captures the NG signatures in the data extremely well

- [Fast Lightcones for Combined Cosmological Probes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.05735)
    - **Useful**

    - 结合这些宇宙学探测：weak lensing shear, galaxy overdensity including RSD, CMB lensing, and CMB temperature anisotropies from the ISW effect
    - We find that the inclusion of the cross-correlations between the probes significantly increases the information gain in the parameter constraints.
    - We also find that the use of a non-Gaussian covariance matrix is increasingly important, as more probes and cross-correlation power spectra are included.

- [Interpreting deep learning models for weak lensing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.06529)
    - We analyze a DNN that has been found in previous work to accurately recover cosmological parameters in simulated maps of the WL convergence (κ).
    - We apply a series of well established saliency methods to interpret the DNN and find that the most relevant pixels are those with extreme κ values.
    - In the presence of shape nose, the attribution concentrates in high convergence regions, with 36−68% of the attribution in regions with κ>3σκ.

- [A Fast, 2D Gaussian Process Method Based on Celerite: Applications to Transiting Exoplanet Discovery and Characterization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.05799)
    - Here we present an extension of the celerite method to two input dimensions, where, typically, the second dimension is small.
    - We demonstrate the application of this method to the problem of measuring precise transit parameters from multiwavelength light curves and show that it has the potential to improve transit parameters measurements by orders of magnitude.

    - ALMA 0.5pc观测中心分子气体盘：This disc is surrounded by a morphologically and kinematically complex flocculent distribution of molecular clouds
    - We show here that both the observed molecular gas and stellar kinematics independently require a ~5x10^5 Msun black hole once we include the contribution of the molecular gas to the potential.
    - This IMBH mass is broadly consistent with extrapolations from the black hole mass - velocity dispersion and black hole mass - bulge mass relations.

- [Less than the sum of its parts: the dust-corrected Hα luminosity of star-forming galaxies explored at different spatial resolutions with MaNGA and MUSE](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.05544)

    - 在MaNGA 1-2 kpc的分辨率下，这个低估的比例很低，只有2-4%
    - 在MUSE的更高分辨率下，用local的Ha/Hb改正消光，发现低估的比例在14%左右; 但仍可能只是真正效应的下限

- [Dissecting and Modelling Galaxy Assembly Bias](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.05545)
    - **Relevant**
    - 基于SAM的研究，比较恒星质量挑选样本的clustering信号：We find that commonly-used properties like the halo age or concentration amount to only 20-30% of the signal, while the smoothed matter density or the tidal anisotropy can explain the full level of assembly bias
    - Finally, we propose a practical modification of the standard halo occupation distribution model, which can be tuned to any level of assembly bias.

- [Dual supermassive black holes at close separation revealed by the Hyper Suprime-Cam Subaru Strategic Program](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.05581)
    - Using an automated image analysis routine on 34,476 known SDSS quasars, we identify those with two (or more) distinct optical point sources in HSC images covering 796 deg^2. We find 421 candidates out to a redshift of 4.5 更仔细地排除恒星后可能还剩100个
    - Using Keck-I/LRIS and Gemini-N/NIFS, we spectroscopically confirm three dual quasar systems at z < 1, two of which are previously unknown out of eight observed
    - We find a dual quasar fraction of 0.26+/-0.18% and no evidence for evolution. A comparison with the Horizon-AGN simulation seems to support the case of no evolution in the dual quasar fraction when broadly matching the quasar selection.

- [The Host Galaxy of the Dwarf Seyfert UGC 06728](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.05590)
    - HST观测：we find that UGC 06728 is a barred lenticular (SB0) galaxy with prominent ansae at the ends of the bar.

    - Based on the analysis of the radial velocities and galaxy colour distributions, we find that galaxies redder than the colour-magnitude relation (CMR) have a velocity distribution strongly concentrated towards the values of the dominant galaxies and are homogeneously distributed throughout the cluster.
    - Those bluer than the CMR, in turn, have a much more extended radial velocity distribution and are concentrated towards the centre of the cluster

- [A successful search for intervening 21 cm HI absorption in galaxies at 0.4 < z <1.0 with the Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder (ASKAP)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.05648)

Fifty of the 53 radio sources observed have reliable optical redshifts, giving a total redshift path Δz = 21.37.
    - Four intervening HI lines were detected, two of them new. In each case, the estimated HI column density lies above the DLA limit for HI spin temperatures above 50-80 K, and we estimate a DLA number density at redshift z∼0.6 of n(z)=0.19+0.15−0.09.
    - It represents an important proof of concept for the much larger 21cm First Large Absorption Survey in HI (FLASH) project to be carried out with the full 36-antenna ASKAP telescope, probing a total redshift path Δz∼50,000.

    - We fit the CiC statistics to two models: the gravitational quasi-equilibrium distribution (GQED) and the negative binomial distribution (NBD). 比较full hydro run和DM only run
    - CiC分布在两种模拟里基本相似：However, there are quantifiable distinctions between these sets of runs in the evolution and scaling of the best-fit parameters
    - Our results suggest the overall validity of the GQED and NBD models for describing the large-scale statistics of extended, multi-component gravitational systems and subject to complex baryonic physics.

- [Chandra Survey of Nearby Galaxies: an Extended Catalog](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.06026)
    - We construct an extended catalog up to 150 Mpc and make a cross-correlation with a catalog of nearby galaxy groups.
    - The new catalog consists of 1,964 galaxies, out of which 1,692 have a redshift independent distance, 1,557 are listed in the galaxy group catalog with group properties available, and 782 are identified to be X-ray AGN candidates.
    - With the new sample, we compare AGN fractions between early-type and late-type galaxies, and between central and satellite galaxies in groups, and find no significant difference.

    - **Interesting**
    - We probe the plane-of-the-sky orientation of magnetic fields in clusters using the intensity gradients. The technique is a branch of the Gradient Technique (GT) that employs emission intensity maps from turbulent gas. 看Chandra观测的Perseus，M87，Coma和A2597
    - The GT-predicted magnetic field shows signatures of magnetic draping around rising bubbles driven by supermassive black hole (SMBH) feedback in the centers of cool-core clusters, as well as draping around substructures merging with the Coma cluster.
    - 关于磁场的指向：The orientation is consistent with the prediction of heat-flux-driven buoyancy instability (HBI) in cluster cool cores, and possibly the magnetothermal instability (MTI) in cluster outskirts.

    - We construct a physical model of a disk region approximately located between the radius of dust sublimation at the disk mid-plane and the radius at which dust sublimes at the disk surface
    - Our main conclusion is that for a wide range of model parameters such as local accretion rate and/or opacity, the accretion disk's own radiation pressure on dust significantly influences its vertical structure. 可以让盘从thin变成slim的

    - By combining ACT data with large-scale information from WMAP we measure H0=67.6±1.1 km/s/Mpc, at 68% confidence, in excellent agreement with the independently-measured Planck satellite estimate
    - The ΛCDM model provides a good fit to the ACT data, and we find no evidence for deviations: both the spatial curvature, and the departure from the standard lensing signal in the spectrum, are zero to within 1σ; the number of relativistic species, the primordial Helium fraction, and the running of the spectral index are consistent with ΛCDM predictions to within 1.5-2σ.

- [The Atacama Cosmology Telescope: A Measurement of the Cosmic Microwave Background Power Spectra at 98 and 150 GHz](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.07289)

    - The maps reveal 4,000 optically-confirmed clusters through the Sunyaev Zel'dovich effect (SZ) and 18,500 point source candidates at >5σ
    - The multi-frequency maps provide millimeter images of nearby galaxies and individual Milky Way nebulae, and even clear detections of several nearby stars.

    - We employed a soft clustering scheme, based on the Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM), to classify these objects simultaneously using the following parameters: black hole mass, colour and R loudness index, as well as the usual radio and B-band luminosity.
    - Our results indicate the persistence of a dichotomy in all datasets, although the discriminating power differs for different choices of parameters. Although the Radio Loudness parameter alone does not seem to be enough to display the dichotomy, the evidence of two populations of AGNs could persist even if we consider other parameters.

    - The misalignment between the jet and the NLR is not a projection effect, as previously thought.
    - A molecular outflow is detected for the first time in this galaxy and, just like in NGC 1068, the transition between the molecular and the ionized gas phases comes from the fragmentation of molecular cavity walls into bullets of ionized gas exposed to the central source.

- [Central velocity dispersion catalog of LAMOST-DR7 galaxies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.07823)

    - Reveal a \sim2 Mpc-scale radio halo elongated in the east-west direction, coincident with the intracluster gas.
    - Our weak-lensing analysis shows that the system is massive (M_{200}=1.04\pm0.36\times 10^{15} M_{\odot}) and composed of at least three subclusters.

    - Using models where the SFR is a power law in time of the form propto (t - t1)^eta for t1 = 1.8 Gyr (with no stars forming prior to t1) implies that eta = 0.18 +- 0.03.

- [The role of mergers and fly-bys in driving the evolution of dwarf galaxies over cosmic time](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.07913)
    - New Horizon模拟 (40 pc分辨率)：while dwarf galaxies often exhibit disturbed morphologies (30 and 50 per cent are disturbed at z=1 and z=3 respectively), only a small proportion of the morphological disturbances seen in dwarf galaxies are driven by mergers at any redshift
    - Dwarfs typically undergo one major and one minor merger between z=5 and z=0.5, accounting for 10 per cent of their total stellar mass.
    - dwarf的并合能提高一点SFR，但是贡献的恒星质量总量很少；Non-merger interactions drive significantly smaller star formation enhancements (around two times), but their preponderance relative to mergers means they account for 10 per cent of stellar mass in the dwarf regime.

    - 气体分布的不对称性是因为：the fragmentation of the north-eastern molecular wall,
    - We propose that those blobs are driven by a hot "secondary wind" coming from the spot where the jet interacts and injects its energy in the molecular gas. The combination of a primary wind launched by the central source and the secondary wind is what we call a two-stage outflow.

    - Keck近红外观测在一个Bulgeless星系里看到的隐藏宽线区
    - The lack of a bulge component suggests that the SMBH has grown quiescently, likely caused by secular processes independent of major mergers. 但可以用Mstar提到Mbulge
    - In addition, we detect extended narrow Paα emission that allows us to create a rotation curve where we see counter-rotating gas within the central kiloparsec (kpc).

- [Hidden AGN in dwarf galaxies revealed by MaNGA: light echoes, off-nuclear wanderers, and a new broad-line AGN](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.08527)
    - MaNGA中找到37个有AGN迹象的Dwarf，大部分在整体SED上体现不出AGN特征
    - The AGN emission is in most cases offset from the optical center of the dwarf galaxy and shows a symmetric morphology, which indicates that either the AGN are off-nuclear, that the central emission of the galaxy is dominated by star formation, or that the AGN are turned-off and we are observing a past ionisation burst.
    - One of the new AGN shows a broad Hα emission line component, from which we derive a black hole mass in the realm of intermediate-mass black holes. This constitutes the first hidden type 1 AGN discovered in a dwarf galaxy based on IFU spectroscopy.

    - We find that the [CI] line basically traces structures detected in CO (and dust)
    - A pixel-by-pixel comparison revealed that there is a radial L′[CI]/L′CO gradient and a superlinear L′CO vs. L′[CI] relation (slope = 1.54 ± 0.02) at this spatial scale
    - Based on the molecular gas masses converted from the dust continuum emission, we found that the CO-to-H2 and [CI]-to-H2 conversion factors are relatively flat across the molecular gas disk

    - Based on a sample of low surface brightness galaxies (LSBG) that covers a wide range of color and luminosity, we re-calibrated each original CMLR in r, i, z, J, H, and K bands to give internally self-consistent M* for a same galaxy.
    - For each CMLR, the re-calibrated relations provided in this work could produce internally self-consistent M* from divergent photometric bands, and are extensions of the re-calibrations from Johnson-Cousin filter system by the pioneering work of McGaugh & Schombert (2014) to SDSS filter system.

    - We identified four red quasar candidates from the spectroscopically confirmed 93 high-z quasars in the SHELLQs sample, based on detections in the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) data at 3.4 and 4.6 um. Two of the four candidates were found to be red quasars with dust reddening of E(B-V) > 0.1.

    - There are two regions of turbulent gas, with position angles similar to the jet/cones, seen both in molecular and ionized phases
    - We explain these structures as a consequence of a "digging process" that the jet inflicts on the disc, ejecting the molecular gas towards the ionization cones

    - The overall sensitivity of the instrument and telescope was 90,000 LU, due primarily to increased noise from stray light.

- [The Completed SDSS-IV extended Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey: Cosmological Implications from two Decades of Spectroscopic Surveys at the Apache Point observatory](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.08991)
    - These experiments, composed of data from SDSS, SDSS-II, BOSS, and eBOSS, offer independent measurements of baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) measurements of angular-diameter distances and Hubble distances relative to the sound horizon, rd, from eight different samples and six measurements of the growth rate parameter, fσ8, from redshift-space distortions (RSD).
    - We show that the BAO data alone are able to rule out dark-energy-free models at more than eight standard deviations in an extension to the flat, ΛCDM model that allows for curvature.
    - The RSD measurements indicate a growth rate that is consistent with predictions from Planck primary data and with General Relativity.
    - When combining the results of SDSS BAO and RSD with external data, all multiple-parameter extensions remain consistent with a ΛCDM model.

- [The splashback radius of halos from particle dynamics: III. Halo catalogs, merger trees, and host-subhalo relations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.09149)
    - **Useful, Relevant**
    - It is often difficult to assess the impact of a particular choice because most halo catalogs contain only one or a few definitions and generally only one set of host-subhalo relations. To alleviate this issue, we present halo catalogs and merger trees for 14 N-body simulations of LambdaCDM and self-similar universes. Rockstar + SPARTA
    - The new catalogs contain numerous variants of spherical overdensity and splashback radii and masses and, most critically, host-subhalo relations for each definition.

- [Detection capabilities of the Athena X-IFU for the warm-hot intergalactic medium using gamma-ray burst X-ray afterglows](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.10158)
    - Athena, the proposed European Space Agency X-ray observatory, aims to detect the `missing' baryons in the WHIM up to redshifts of z=1 through absorption in active galactic nuclei and gamma-ray burst afterglow spectra, allowing for the study of the evolution of these large-scale structures of the Universe. 模拟利用GRB X-ray余辉中看到的WHIM纤维的吸收
    - The analyses of X-IFU spectra by blind line search show that Athena will be able to detect O VII-O VIII absorption pairs with EWOVII>0.13 eV and EWOVIII>0.09 eV for afterglows with F>2×10−11 erg cm−2 s−1.

- [Constraining the Photoionization Models With a Reprojected Optical Diagnostic Diagram](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.09159)
    - **Useful**
    - We present a simple reprojection of the 3D line ratio space composed of [N II]λ6583/Hα, [S II]λλ6716, 6731/Hα, and [O III]λ 5007/Hβ, which reveals its model-constraining power and removes the ambiguity for the true composite objects.
    - With this reprojection, we can put strong constraints on the photoionization models and the secondary nitrogen abundance prescription. We find that a single nitrogen prescription cannot fit both the star-forming locus and AGN locus simultaneously, with the latter requiring higher N/O ratios.
    - We can compute the fractional AGN contributions for the composite regions, and define demarcations with specific upper limits on contamination from AGN or star formation.

    - NGC 90, a pair member of interacting system Arp 65 (NGC 90/93)
    - In the central part of the galaxy a significant role belongs to non-photoionization mechanism of line emission probably caused by shocks due to LINER-like activity of the nucleus.
    - The most intriguing peculiarity of the galaxy is the presence of the discovered earlier huge HI `cloud' containing about half of total mass of galaxy gas. We argue that it presents a flow of gas sweeping by ram pressure and elongated along a line of sight.

    - We describe the numerical experiments to determine if the so-called dark matter deficient galaxies (DMDGs) could be produced when two gas-rich, dwarf-sized galaxies collide with a high relative velocity of ∼300kms−1
    - Then using a large simulated universe IllustrisTNG, we discover a number of high-velocity galaxy collision events in which DMDGs are expected to form. However, we did not find evidence that these types of collisions actually produced DMDGs in the IllustrisTNG100-1 run. 认为是分辨率的问题

- [ALMA and MUSE observations reveal a quiescent multi-phase circumgalactic medium around the z~3.6 radio galaxy 4C 19.71](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.10061)
    - This radio galaxy has extended Lyα emission over a region ~100 kpc in size preferentially oriented along the axis of the radio jet. Faint Lyα emission extends beyond the radio hot spots. We also find extended CIV and HeII emission over a region of ~150 kpc in size
    - The [CI] is detected in the same region with FWHM~100 km/s and Δv~5 km/s, while [CI] is not detected in the regions south of the radio galaxy.
    - We interpret the coincidence in the northern line emission as evidence of relatively quiescent multi-phase gas residing within the halo at a projected distance of ~75 kpc from the host galaxy.

- [Universal at last? The splashback mass function of dark matter halos](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.10346)
    - **Important, Relevant**
    - 困难：simulations exhibit persistent non-universalities in the mass functions of the virial mass and other commonly used spherical overdensity definitions.
    - In LambdaCDM cosmologies, all mass definitions exhibit varying levels of non-universality that increase with peak height and reach between 20% and 500% at the highest masses we can test. Mvir, M200m, and Msp exhibit similar levels of non-universality.
    - 在z<2和self-similar cosmologies with extreme power spectra的情况下，Splashback质量的HMF的一致性最好
    - These results strongly support the notion that the splashback radius is a physically motivated definition of the halo boundary. We present a simple, universal fitting formula for splashback mass Gfunctions that accurately reproduces our simulation data.

    - We use the NEXUS+ multiscale formalism to identify the hierarchy of Gilaments and sheets of the cosmic web at several redshifts. 暗物质晕自旋的程度与宇宙网络结构的环境一直都是相关的
    - Massive haloes in thick filaments spin faster than their counterparts in thin filaments, while for low-mass haloes the reverse is true.
    - We also have studied the evolution of alignment between halo spin orientations and the preferential axes of filaments and sheets. The alignment varies with halo mass, with the spins of low-mass haloes being predominantly along the filament spine, while those of high-mass haloes being predominantly perpendicular to the filament spine.
    - 平均来看，所有的halo的spin都在晚期变得更和filament的spine垂直

- [The physical origins of low-mass spin bias](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.10366)
    - At z=0, higher-spin haloes with masses above log(Mc/h−1M⊙)≃11.5 have a higher bias than lower-spin haloes of the same mass. This trend is known to invert below this characteristic crossover mass
    - We measure the redshift evolution and scale dependence of halo spin bias at the low-mass end and demonstrate that the inversion of the signal is entirely produced by the effect of splashback haloes.
        - 小质量的halo很多都在大halo的附近，因此bias受到影响
    - Since splashbacks have been shown to account for some of the assembly bias signal at the low-mass end, our results unveil a specific link between two different secondary bias trends: spin bias and assembly bias.

    - The X-ray counterpart is resolved into a core plus two off-nuclear sources that (combined) account for close to 30% of the total X-ray flux.
    - The broadband spectral energy distribution of 4C 63.20 can be reproduced with a jet model where the majority of the radio flux can be ascribed to synchrotron emission from the hotspots, whereas the (non-nuclear) X-ray emission is produced via Inverse Compton (IC) off of Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) photons within the extended lobes. 高红移CMB更热而且射电瓣磁场可能更强

    - FABLE模拟中矮星系里的AGN Feedback：We find that overmassive black holes (BHs), with respect to the mean scaling relations with their host galaxies, drive hotter and faster outflows and lead to significantly reduced gas mass fractions.
    - While in the local Universe the majority of AGN in dwarfs are much dimmer than the stellar component, for z≥2 there is a significant population that outshines their hosts.

- [The Next Generation Virgo Cluster Survey (NGVS). XXX. Ultra-Diffuse Galaxies and their Globular Cluster Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.10565)

    - Applying a new definition for the UDG class based on galaxy scaling relations, we define samples of 44 and 26 UDGs using expansive and restrictive selection criteria, respectively. 其中很多有极低的面亮度
    - The UDGs in Virgo's core region show some evidence for being structurally distinct from "normal" dwarf galaxies, but this separation disappears when considering the full sample of galaxies throughout the cluster.
    - The globular cluster (GC) systems of Virgo UDGs have a wide range in specific frequency (SN), with a higher mean SN than "normal" Virgo dwarfs, but a lower mean SN than Coma UDGs at fixed luminosity. GC主要是blue population的
    - The combined GC luminosity function is consistent with those observed in dwarf galaxies, showing no evidence of being anomalously luminous.

- [Fly-bys, orbits, splashback: subhalos and the importance of the halo boundary](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.10992)
    - **Important**
    - The recently proposed splashback radius tends to be larger and to include more subhalos than even the largest spherical overdensity boundaries
    - Using splashback radii can yet double the abundance of subhalos compared to the virial definition.
    - 关于Flyby halo的本质：We also quantify the abundance of flyby (or backsplash) halos, hosts that used to be subhalos in the past. We show that the majority of these objects are mislabeled satellites that are naturally classified as subhalos when we use the splashback radius.

- [Reducing the Variance of Redshift Space Distortion Measurements from Mock Galaxy Catalogues with Different Lines of Sight](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.11417)
    - Anisotropic two-point clustering measurements from the same simulation show some scatter for different lines of sight (LOS), but are on average equal, due to cosmic variance. This results in scatter in the measured cosmological parameters.
    - The quadrupole of the 2-point statistics is particularly sensitive to changes in the LOS, with sub-percent level differences in the velocity distributions resulting in ~1.5σ shifts on large scales. Averaging over multiple LOS can reduce the impact of cosmic variance.

    - STARS library, a grid of tidal disruption event (TDE) simulations interpolated to provide the mass fallback rate (dM/dt) to the black hole for a main-sequence star of any stellar mass, stellar age, and impact parameter.
    - We provide new fitting formulae for important disruption quantities (βcrit,ΔM,M˙peak,tpeak,n∞) as a function of stellar mass, stellar age, and impact parameter.
    - More centrally concentrated stars have steeper dM/dt rise slopes and shallower decay slopes.

- [Radio activity of supermassive black holes with extremely high accretion rates](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.11327)
    - Radio emission from the high- and super-Eddington accreting active galactic nuclei (AGNs) has various origins: a persistent jet, the magnetized corona and the wind-like outflows. 单不清楚哪个站主导
    - VLA 5GHz观测25个：extremely high Eddington accreting supermassive black holes (EESBHs, the Eddington ratio close to or above one) from narrow-line Seyfert 1 galaxies
    - Most of EESBHs show a compact radio structure from a few hundred parsecs to one-kiloparsec scale.
    - The high-Eddington and mildly super-Eddington AGNs (-0.5< log lambda_Edd<0.6) have a radio to X-ray luminosity ratio L_R/L_X~10^-5 to 10^-4 and a steep radio spectrum, supporting that the radio emission is from transient ejecta (outflows) of corona, however, the jet contribution cannot be fully ruled out.
    - Our highly super-Eddington sources (log lambda_Edd>~0.6) have a flatter radio spectrum, along with its low radio luminosity: L_R/L_X~10^-5, their radio emission is likely dominated by a magnetized corona, and a radiation pressure caused jet is also proposed

- [Spatial and Kinematic Clustering of Stars in the Galactic Disk](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.10990)
    - **Interesting**
    - We calculate the spatial and kinematic two-point correlation functions using a sample of 1.7×106 stars within 1 kpc of the Sun with 6D phase space information available from Gaia DR2
    - Clustering is detected on spatial scales of 1-300 pc and velocity scales of at least 15 km s−1.
    - 相关函数的形式：After removing bound structures, the data have a power-law index of γ≈−1 for <100 pc and γ≲−1.5 for >100 pc.

- [Gas-phase metallicity gradients of TNG50 star-forming galaxies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.10993)
    - The radial gas-phase, mass-weighted metallicity profiles and gradients of the TNG50 star-forming galaxy population measured at redshifts z= 0-3
    - We find that TNG50 gradients are predominantly negative at all redshifts, although we observe significant diversity among these negative gradients
    - We determine that the gradient steepness of all galaxies increases approximately monotonically with redshift at a roughly constant rate. This rate does not vary significantly with galaxy mass.
    - We also find that redshift z=0 and z=0.5 TNG50 gradients are consistent with the gradients observed in galaxies at these redshifts, although the preference for flat gradients observed in redshift z≳1 galaxies is not present in TNG50.

- [Dwarfs in the Milky Way halo outer rim: first in-fall or backsplash satellites?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.11001)
    - Leo T is a gas-rich dwarf located at 414kpc (1.4Rvir) distance from the Milky Way (MW) and it is currently assumed to be on its first approach.
    - 但新的轨道研究显示Leo T更可能是一个backsplah星系
    - We applied our method to other distant MW satellites, finding a range of gas stripped backsplash solutions for the gas-less Cetus and Eridanus II, providing a possible explanation for their lack of cold gas, while only first in-fall solutions are found for the HI rich Phoenix I.

- [Co-evolution of black hole accretion and star formation in galaxies up to z=3.5](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.11002)
    - We study the co-evolution between the black hole accretion rate (BHAR) and the star formation rate (SFR) in different galaxy life phases: main sequence star-forming galaxies, quiescent and starburst galaxies at different cosmic epochs.
    - We find that the ratio between BHAR and SFR does not evolve with redshift, although it depends on stellar mass. For the star-forming populations, this dependence on M* has a logarithmic slope of ∼0.6, for the starburst sample of ∼0.4, both at odds with quiescent sources where it remains constant (log(BHAR/SFR)∼−3.4)
    - Our results support the idea that the same physical processes feed and sustain both star formation and black hole accretion.

- [Far-Infrared Photometric Redshifts: A New Approach to a Highly Uncertain Enterprise](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.11012)
    - I present a new approach at deriving far-infrared photometric redshifts for galaxies based on their reprocessed emission from dust at rest-frame far-infrared through millimeter wavelengths.
    - I use the observed distribution of galaxy SEDs (for well-constrained samples across 0< z<5) to motivate a new far-infrared through millimeter photometric redshift technique called MMpz.
    - The MMpz algorithm asserts that galaxies are most likely drawn from the empirically observed relationship between rest-frame peak wavelength, λpeak, and total IR luminosity, LIR

    - We find there is a central galaxy and satellite conformity between these FGs and normal groups: centrals and satellites in the former form earlier and more stellar deficient than their counterparts of the latter.
    - When split by the peak redshift for the star formation rate of a group, the mass functions of satellite halos on either side of the peak redshift are found to be indistinguishable between FGs and normal groups, indicating a self-similarity of halo assembly with respect to the peak.

    - We present - and make publicly available - accurate and precise photometric redshifts in the 2deg2 COSMOS field for objects with iAB≤23.
    - We introduce a new method that models the spectral energy distributions (SEDs) as a linear combination of continuum and emission line templates and computes its Bayes evidence, integrating over the linear combinations.
    - The correlation between the UV luminosity and the OII line is measured using the 66 available bands with the zCOSMOS spectroscopic sample, and used as a prior which constrains the relative flux between continuum and emission line templates.

- [The Interplay Between Star Formation and Black Hole Accretion in Nearby Active Galaxies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.11283)
    - We take advantage of a recently developed SFR estimator based on the [O II] λ3727 and [O III] λ5007 emission lines to investigate the SFRs of the host galaxies of more than 5,800 type 1 and 7,600 type 2 AGNs with z<0.35
    - After matching in luminosity and redshift, we find that type 1 and type 2 AGNs have a similar distribution of internal reddening, which is significant and corresponds to ∼10^9M⊙ of cold molecular gas. 但Type 2 AGN比Type 1 的SFR要强
    - We observe a tight, linear relation between AGN luminosity (accretion rate) and SFR, one that becomes more significant toward smaller physical scales, suggesting that the link between the AGN and star formation occurs in the central kpc-scale region.

- [Black Hole Accretion Correlates with Star Formation Rate and Star Formation Efficiency](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.11285)
    - 453 z≈0.3 type 1 active galactic nuclei (AGNs). 用CO观测看气体质量
    - We reaffirm the notion that powerful AGNs have comparable gas content as nearby star-forming galaxies and that AGN feedback does not deplete the host of cold gas instantaneously.
    - We demonstrate that while the strong correlation between star formation rate and black hole accretion rate is in part driven by the mutual dependence of these parameters on molecular gas mass, the star formation rate and black hole accretion rate are still weakly correlated after removing the dependence of star formation rate on molecular gas mass

- [AGN Feedback and Star Formation of Quasar Host Galaxies: Insights from the Molecular Gas](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.11286)
    - We use CO(2-1) observations from a new ALMA survey, in conjunction with literature measurements, to investigate the molecular gas properties of a representative sample of 40 z<0.3 Palomar-Green quasars
    - We find that the AGN luminosity correlates with both the CO luminosity and black hole mass, suggesting that AGN activity is loosely coupled to the cold gas reservoir of the host.
    - The host galaxies of low-redshift quasars have molecular gas content similar to that of star-forming galaxies of comparable stellar mass. Moreover, they share similar gas kinematics, as evidenced by their CO Tully-Fisher relation and the absence of detectable molecular outflows down to sensitive limits.

    - We find that the mass of gas at 0.7 keV in a cluster is remarkably similar to that of the molecular gas. Assuming pressure equilibrium between the phases, this means that they occupy volumes differing by 10^5.

    - We find a very good agreement between the recovered and the true SFHs of all the simulated dwarf galaxies in our sample, from the synthetic CMD analysis of their V-I versus I as well as the I-H versus H CMDs.
    - Dust leads to an underestimation of the SFR during the last few hundred million years.

- [Estimating supermassive black hole masses in AGNs using polarization of broad MgII, Hα and Hβ lines](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.11475)
    - For type-1 active galactic nuclei (AGNs) for which the equatorial scattering is the dominant broad line polarization mechanism, it is possible to measure the supermassive black hole mass by tracing the Keplerian motion across the polarization plane positionangle.
    - We use 3D Monte Carlo radiative transfer code stokes for simultaneous modeling of equatorial scattering of Hα, Hβ and Mg II lines. We included vertical inflows and outflows in the MgII broad line region (BLR).
    - For Mg II line, we find that polarization angle φ exhibits an additional "plateau" with a constant φ, which deviates than the profiles expected for pure Keplerian motion.
    - SMBH mass estimates using Mg II line are higher by up to 35% than those obtained from Hα and Hβ lines.

    - Given the limitations of a reliable GC selection based on two relatively close optical bands only, we find that half of the UDG candidates have a total GC population consistent with zero.
    - Of the other half, two galaxies have a total population larger than zero at 2σ level.

    - Find that DMGal is dominated by the hot phase probed by X-rays.
    - The DMGal does not appear to follow any trend with the galactic longitude or latitude, and there is a large scatter around the values predicted by simple disk+halo models.

    - Our results indicate that the best-fit templates of five GRB host galaxies do not require an AGN component, suggesting the absence of AGNs.
    - Our results indicate the importance of rest-frame FIR observations to correctly estimate SFRs by covering thermal emission from cold dust heated by star formation.

    - The galaxies have a mean value of logN/O=-1.16, close to the maximum values found for star-forming (SF) galaxies in the metallicity range of 12+logO/H=7.7-8.1.
    - All 11 low-z LyC emitting galaxies found by Izotov et al. (2016, 2018), including the ones considered in the present study, are characterised by high EW(Hbeta)~200-400A, high ionisation parameter (log(U)=-2.5 to -1.7), high average ionising photon production efficiency

    - Galaxies first consume their gas mostly through bursty star formation, then enter into a transition phase of intermediate gas richness in which star formation and AGNs coexist, before settling into retirement as gas-poor, quiescent systems with residual levels of AGN activity (LINERs).
    - Strongly accreting black holes (Seyferts) live in gas-rich, star-forming hosts, but neither their gas reservoir nor their ability to form stars seem to be impacted \emph{instantaneously} (timescales ≲0.5\,Gyr) by AGN feedback

    - **Useful, CSST**
    - The established stacked estimator of n(z) avoids reducing photo-z PDFs to point estimates but yields a systematically biased estimate of n(z) that worsens with decreasing signal-to-noise, the very regime where photo-z PDFs are most necessary.
    - We introduce Cosmological Hierarchical Inference with Probabilistic Photometric Redshifts (CHIPPR), a statistically rigorous probabilistic graphical model of redshift-dependent photometry, which correctly propagates the redshift uncertainty information beyond the best-fit estimator of n(z) produced by traditional procedures and is provably the only self-consistent way to recover n(z) from photo-z PDFs. 但计算量更大

    - 总能量的估计比以往的估计要高：predominantly because, if the luminosity follows the mass fallback rate, TDEs release a significant fraction of their energy long after their light curve peaks.

    - The added freedom in the group-finding algorithm is self-calibrated using observations of color-dependent galaxy clustering, as well as measurements of the total satellite luminosity in deep imaging data around stacked samples of spectroscopic central galaxies, L_sat.

- [On a possible cosmological evolution of galaxy cluster YX−YSZE scaling relation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.13998)
    - An important result from self-similar models that describe the process of galaxy cluster formation is the simple scaling relation Y_SZE* D^2_{A} /C_{XSZE} * Y_X = C.
    - we consider the cosmic distance duality relation validity jointly with type Ia supernovae observations plus 61 Y_SZE* D^2_{A} /C_{XSZE} * Y_X measurements as reported by the Planck Collaboration to explore if this relation is constant in the redshift range considered (z<0.5).
    - It is worth to stress that the observational determination of an universal C(z) function turns the Y_SZE* D^2_{A} /C_{XSZE} * Y_X ratio in an useful cosmological tool to determine cosmological parameters.

- [Measuring stellar and black hole masses of tidal disruption events](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.13765)
    - 用TDE估计黑洞和恒星质量：The black hole mass depends mostly on the temperature observed at peak luminosity, while the mass of the disrupted star depends mostly on the peak luminosity.
    - We introduce TDEmass, a method to infer the black hole and stellar masses given these two input quantities

    - 看不同年龄的星族的分布profile：We find two clear breaks in the density profiles of the old RGB and intermediate-aged stars: one down-bending (Type II) at R∼5.9 kpc, and another up-bending (Type III) at R∼8.3 kpc
    - The outer stellar component at R⪆8 kpc is, therefore, well separated from the inner disk in terms of the stellar density and stellar populations. 可能有stellar halo成分

- [The Effects of Dwarf Galaxies on the Orbital Evolution of Galactic Globular Clusters](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.13752)
    - We determine the orbits of the Milky Way's 150 globular clusters in a gravitational potential both with and without dwarf galaxies. We find that the presence of a small number of satellite galaxies can strongly affect the orbits of many of the globular clusters. 尤其是对于outer GCs，轨道半长轴和椭率都可以有比较大的变化
    - Furthermore, we caution against using kinematics alone to identify whether a Galactic cluster formed in-situ or was accreted during a past merger event as these values are no longer conserved.

- [Census and classification of low-surface-brightness structures in nearby early-type galaxies from the MATLAS survey](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.13772)

    - We also detect a total of up to 9 potential z≃6 quasar companion galaxies surrounding five of the six quasars, separated from the quasars by 1.4''-3.2'', or 8.4-19.4 kpc, which may be interacting with the quasar hosts.
    - These results suggest that the quasars are in dense environments typical of luminous z≃6 galaxies.

    - We study a sample of dEs having compact star-forming blobs that are visually similar to dEs' nuclei but by far bluer.
    - 致密恒星形成团块的质量大致是星系质量的1%；有些团块是off-center的；气体丰度接近Solar，但dE本身恒星丰度符合矮星系，远低于solar水平
    - We argue that the central star-forming blobs can provide a caught-in-the-act view of nuclei formation in dEs

- [Some Die Filthy Rich: The Diverse Molecular Gas Contents of Post-starbust Galaxies Probed by Dust Absorption](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.14004)
    - A recent observation shows that about half of QPSBs have large amounts of cold gas.
    - 用Hbeta/Halpha来估计分子气体质量
    - We estimate the molecular gas by either using PSBs with well-measured Hα/Hβ ratios or by measuring them from stacked spectra. Our analysis reveals that QPSBs have a wide range of Hα/Hβ ratios and molecular gas fractions that overlap with the typical gas fractions of star-forming or quiescent galaxies: Hα/Hβ≈3−8 and fH2≈1%−20% with median fH2≈4%−6% 分子气体质量在10^9 Msun左右

- [The Ionised- and Cool-Gas Content of The BR1202-0725 System as seen by MUSE and ALMA](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.14221)
    - MUSE观测：the most overdense fields known in the early Universe
    - We find that QSO BR1202-0725 exhibits a large Lyα halo, covering ≈55 pkpc on-sky
    - In contrast, the SMG, of similar far-infrared luminosity and star formation rate (SFR), does not exhibit such a Lyα halo.
    - We also note a coherent absorption feature at ∼−400km/s in spectra from at least three objects; the QSO, LAE1 and "LAE2" which could imply the presence of an expanding neutral gas shell with an extent of at least 24 pkpc.

- [Probing Feedback via IGM tomography and Lyα forest with Subaru PFS, TMT/ELT, & JWST](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.14253)
    - **SSST**
    - GADGET3-Osaka模拟预研: We create light-cone data set at z=2−3 from our simulations and generate mock Lyα forest data.
    - We focus on the distribution of HI and galaxies, and present statistical results on 1-D flux PDF, 1-D power spectrum, flux contrast vs. impact parameter, HI−galaxy cross-correlations.
    - Comparison with observations shows that the current observed data points include important contributions from lower mass galaxies of M⋆∼10^8−10^10M⊙ rather than just from massive galaxies of M⋆≥10^10M⊙, which dilutes the stronger signal of flux contrast around massive galaxies.

    - We also measure the shift in best-fit parameters when fitting delensed versus lensed spectra; Fitting with a LCDM model and marginalizing over foregrounds, we find that the shift in cosmological parameters is consistent with zero.
    - Our results show that gravitational lensing of the microwave background is internally consistent within the framework of the standard cosmological model.

    - 对DESI这样的大尺度巡天：The Cartesian power spectrum analysis of anisotropic galaxy clustering based on the Fourier plane wave basis makes a number of assumptions, including the local plane-parallel approximation, that will no longer be valid
    - We also release our public code Harmonia (https://github.com/MikeSWang/Harmonia) for galaxy clustering likelihood inference in spherical Fourier or hybrid-basis analyses.

- [Cosmological Model Parameter Dependence of the Matter Power Spectrum Covariance from the DEUS-PUR Cosmo Simulations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.14984)
    - The Dark Energy Universe Simulation - Parallel Universe Runs (DEUS-PUR) Cosmo. These consist of 512 realizations for 10 different cosmologies
    - Using a Fisher matrix approach, we evaluate the impact of using a covariance estimated at a fiducial model rather than the true underlying cosmology. We find that the estimated 1σ errors are affected at approximately 5%, 20%, 50% and 120% level when assuming non-fiducial values
    - These results suggest that the use of cosmology-dependent covariances is key for precision cosmology.

- [Analytic marginalization of N(z) uncertainties in tomographic galaxy surveys](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.14989)
    - We allow for arbitrary deviations from the best-guess N(z) governed by a general covariance matrix describing the uncertainty in our knowledge of redshift distributions.
    - by linearly expanding the theory predictions around a fiducial model, this marginalization can be performed analytically, resulting in a modified data covariance matrix that effectively downweights the modes of the data vector that are more sensitive to redshift distribution variations.

- [Measuring accretion disk sizes of lensed quasars with microlensing time delay in multi-band light curves](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.14416)
    - We first investigate how microlensing time delay changes with assumptions on the initial mass function (IMF) and find that the more massive microlenses produce the sharper distributions of microlensing time delays.
    - We also find that the magnification probability distributions for different IMFs are indistinguishable from each other.
    - We present a new method to measure the color-dependent source size in lensed quasars using the microlensing time delays inferred from multi-band light curves.

    - QSO有很弱的X-ray探测：We highlight two possible interpretations of this result: the quasar has a steep value of Γ - potentially related to observed ongoing Eddington accretion - thereby pushing much of the emission out of our observed band, or the quasar has a more normal spectrum (Γ∼2) but is therefore less X-ray luminous

- [An efficient hybrid method to produce high resolution large volume dark matter simulations for semi-analytic models of reionisation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.14624)

    - The recovered S8 amplitude is low, however, by 8.3±2.6 % relative to Planck.
    - We quantify the level of agreement between the CMB and our large-scale structure constraints using a series of different metrics, finding differences with a significance ranging between ∼3σ, when considering the offset in S8, and ∼2σ, when considering the full multi-dimensional parameter space.

    - we study how fesc changes when we include two different products of binary stellar evolution - stars stripped of their hydrogen envelopes and massive blue stragglers. 两种过程都能在星暴后10-200Myr内产生大量电离光子
    - We find the relative importance of these photons are amplified with respect to escaped ionizing photons, because peaks in star formation rates (SFRs) and fesc are often out of phase by this 10-200 Myr. 而且小星系主要是通过双星产生LyC光子
    - Overall, including stripped stars and massive blue stragglers increases our photon-weighted mean escape fraction by around 13% and 10%, respectively, resulting in a mean fesc of 17%.

- [Characterizing Quasar CIV Emission-line Measurements from Time-resolved Spectroscopy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.15120)
    - We use multi-epoch quasar spectroscopy to determine how accurately single-epoch spectroscopy can locate quasars in emission-line parameter space in order to inform investigations where time-resolved spectroscopy is not available 
    - 非参数话的光谱发射线成分分析：We find that most of the quasars are well described by just two components, while more components signal a quasar likely to yield a successful reverberation mapping analysis.
    - Multi-epoch spectroscopy reveals that single-epoch results do not significantly change where quasars are located in CIV parameter space and do not have a significant impact on investigations of the global Baldwin Effect
    - Quasars with emission line properties indicative of higher L/LEdd are less variable, consistent with models with enhanced accretion disk density.

- [The Next Generation Virgo Cluster Survey. XXXIV. Ultra-Compact Dwarf (UCD) Galaxies in the Virgo Cluster](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.15275)
    - **Relevant**
    - We have identified more than 600 candidate UCDs, from the core of Virgo out to its virial radius.
    - From a surface density map, we find the UCDs to be mostly concentrated within Virgo's main subclusters, around its brightest galaxies.
    - We identify several subsamples of UCDs - i.e., the brightest, largest, and those with the most pronounced and/or asymmetric envelopes - that could hold clues to the origin of UCDs and possible evolutionary links with dwarf nuclei.
    - We find some evidence for such a connection from the existence of diffuse envelopes around some UCDs, and comparisons of radial distributions of UCDs and nucleated galaxies within the cluster.
