### Feb 5

- [The halo model as a versatile tool to predict intrinsic alignments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.02700)
  - We account for the different IA signatures at large and small scales as well for the different contribution from central/satellite and red/blue galaxies.
  - The lack of constraints for fainter galaxies is the main source of uncertainty for our predictions of the IA signal.

- [Chandra Observations of NGC 7212: Large-scale Extended Hard X-ray Emission](https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.02271)
  - Chandra观测一个CT AGN，resolved hard (>3 keV) X-ray emission extending out from the central supermassive black hole to kiloparsec scales 而不是只在中心pc尺度上
  - We find ~20 percent of the observed emission is found outside of the central ~kiloparsec, with ~17 percent associated with the soft X-rays, and ~3 percent with hard X-ray continuum and Fe K line

- [GASP XXIV. The history of abruptly quenched galaxies in clusters](https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.02274)
  - All of them have been passive for at least 20 Myr, but their SF declined on different timescales. In most of them the outskirts reached undetectable SFRs before the inner regions
  - The outside-in quenching, the morphology and kinematics of the stellar component, along with the position of these galaxies within massive clusters (sigma_cl=550-950km/s) point to a scenario in which ram pressure stripping has removed the gas, leading to quenching.

- [Dark matter Annihilation in Most Luminous and the Most Massive Ultracompact Dwarf Galaxies (UCD)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.02383)
  - We explore the potential astrophysical signatures of dark matter (DM) annihilations in ultracompact dwarf galaxies (UCDs) considering two of the richest known galaxy clusters within 100 million light-years, nominally, Virgo and Fornax.
  - In the absence of strong γ-ray signatures, we show that synchrotron emission from electrons and positrons produced by DM annihilations can be very sensitive to indirect DM search.

- [xGASS: The Role of Bulges Along and Across the Local Star-Forming Main Sequence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.02464)
  - We show that the slope in the sSFR-M⋆ relation flattens by ∼0.1 dex per decade in M⋆ when re-normalising sSFR by disc stellar mass instead of total stellar mass
  - The residual declining slope of the SFMS is intrinsic to the disc components of galaxies.
  - The average B/T of local galaxies decreases monotonically with increasing ΔSFRMS.
  - Contrary to previous works, we find that the upper-envelope of the SFMS is not dominated by objects with a significant bulge component. 近邻宇宙中恒星形成活跃的星系不经历明显的buldge growth

- [SDSS-IV MaNGA: Kinematic Asymmetry as An Indicator of Galaxy Interaction in Paired Galaxies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.02493)
  - We find that the star formation rate (SFR) of the paired galaxies with high kinematic asymmetry is significantly enhanced even when the projected separation between the pair members is quite large (dp~100 kpc). 
  - On the contrary, no significant SFR enhancement is found for the paired galaxies with low kinematic asymmetry even when their projected separation is small (dp < 30 kpc).
  - The kinematic asymmetry is an excellent indicator of galaxy-galaxy interaction strength, which helps us better understand the merging stage of the observed galaxy pairs.

- [Surface Brightness Fluctuation spectra to constrain stellar population properties](https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.02563)
  - **Interesting**
  - We present a new set of Surface Brightness Fluctuation spectra computed with the E-MILES stellar population synthesis models.
  - We also show that the SBF spectra can be very useful for constraining relevant stellar population parameters. We find small (<5%) mass-fractions of extremely metal-poor components ([M/H]<-1) on the top of the dominant, old and metal-rich stellar population.

- [On the nature of Small Galaxy Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.02784)
  - Small Galaxy Systems: pairs, triplets, and groups with four or more members.
  - Galaxies in groups are systematically redder and with lower star formation activity indicators than galaxies in pairs which have a higher fraction of star forming galaxies.
