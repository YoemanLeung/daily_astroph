- [Weak lensing clusters from HSC survey first-year data: Mitigating the dilution effect of foreground and cluster member galaxies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.00170)
  - We adopt the globally normalized weak lensing estimator which is least affected by cluster member galaxies, and we select source galaxies by using photometric redshift information to mitigate the effect of foreground galaxies
  - We find that 107 out of 124 peaks have matched clusters within 5 arcmin from peak positions. Among them, we define a sub-sample of 64 secure clusters that we use to examine dilution effects on our weak lensing peak finding

- [Effect of Active Galactic Nuclei Thermal Heating with Radial Dependence on Thermal Stability of Simulated Galaxy Clusters](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.00021)
  - ENZO模拟校验：Previous analytical work has suggested specific configurations of heating kernels that may result in thermal balance and a steady state.
  - Some heating kernels produced thermally steady galaxy clusters, no kernel was able to produce a steady cluster with a central entropy as low as the central entropies typically observed among CC
  - The simulated clusters enter an unsteady multiphase state on a timescale proportional to the square of the cooling time of the lowest entropy gas in the simulation, with centrally concentrated heating resulting in a steady state lasting for a longer period of time.

- [Why do extremely massive disc galaxies exist today?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.00023)
  - **Relevant**
  - Horizon-AGN里面产生>10^11.4的Disc星系的两个渠道
  - primary channel (accounting for ~70% of these systems and ~8% of massive galaxies) the most recent, significant merger (stellar mass ratio > 1:10) between a massive spheroid and a gas-rich satellite `spins up' the spheroid by creating a new rotational stellar component
  - Secondary channel (accounting for ~30% of these systems and ~3% of massive galaxies), a system maintains a disc throughout its lifetime, due to an anomalously quiet merger history.

- [Clustering of Local Group distances: publication bias or correlated measurements? VII. A distance framework out to 100 Mpc](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.00114)
  - We recommend `best' weighted relative distance moduli for the Fornax and Coma clusters with respect to the Virgo cluster of Δ(m−M)Fornax−Virgo0=0.18±0.28 mag and Δ(m−M)Coma−Virgo0=3.75±0.23 mag. 
  - The absolute and relative distance moduli for both clusters are mutually consistent within the uncertainties; the relative distance moduli yield shorter distances by ∼1σ. Lingering uncertainties in the underlying absolute distance scale appear to have given rise to a systematic uncertainty on the order of 0.20 mag.

- [Outside the Lyman-break box: detecting Lyman continuum emitters at 3.5<z<5.1 with CLAUDS](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.00158)
  - We present a sample of Lyman continuum galaxy (LCG) candidates in the redshift range 3.5≲z≲5.1.
  - 基于BPASS模拟估计：escapte fraction在30-90%之间
  - Stacking candidates without solid LyC detections (S/N<3) results in an estimated fabsesc from galaxies not greater than 1%.

- [A radiative transfer model for the spiral galaxy M33](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.00400)
  - We used the axi-symmetric RT model of Popescu et al. and a new methodology for deriving geometrical parameters, and applied this to decode the{spectral energy distribution (SED) of M33.
  - We predict well the energy balance between absorption and re-emission by dust, with no need to invoke modified grain properties, and we find no submm emission that is in excess of our model predictions.
  - We identify several morphological components in M33, a nuclear, an inner, a main and an outer disc, showing a monotonic trend in decreasing star-formation surface-density

- [A Triple Rollover: A third multiply-imaged source at z~6 behind the Jackpot gravitational lens](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.00649)
  - MUSE观测：we have identified a doubly-imaged Ly α source at redshift 5.975 behind the z = 0.222 lens galaxy J0946+1006
  - 这个系统里之前已经有两个lens-source pair，这是唯一一个triple system
  - The third source also probes two new distance scaling factors which are sensitive to the cosmological parameters of the Universe. 

- [Tight Constraints on the Excess Radio Background at z=9.1 from LOFAR](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.00678)
  - We use the upper limit on the 21-cm signal from the Epoch of Reionization (z = 9.1) based on 141 hours of observations with LOFAR (Mertens et al. 2020) to evaluate the contribution of the high redshift Universe to the detected radio background
  - Even though LOFAR places limit on the extra radio background, excess of 0.1 − 0.7% over the CMB (at 1.42 GHz) is still allowed and could explain the EDGES Low-Band detection

- [The Atacama Cosmology Telescope: A CMB lensing mass map over 2100 square degrees of sky and its cross-correlation with BOSS-CMASS galaxies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.01139)
  - These maps cover 2100 square degrees of sky and overlap with a wide variety of optical surveys
  -  We also create lensing maps with thermal Sunyaev-Zel’dovich contamination removed using a novel cleaning procedure that only slightly degrades the lensing signal-to-noise ratio.
  - The cross-spectrum between the cleaned lensing map and the BOSS CMASS galaxy sample is detected at 10-σ significance, with an amplitude of A = 1.02±0.10 relative to the Planck best-fit LCDM cosmological model with fiducial linear galaxy bias.

- [Survey of Gravitationally-lensed Objects in HSC Imaging (SuGOHI). VI. Crowdsourced lens finding with Space Warps](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.00634)
  - We selected a sample of ∼300,000 galaxies with photometric redshifts in the range 0.2 < zphot < 1.2 and photometrically inferred stellar masses logM∗>11.2.
  - In parallel, we used YattaLens, an automated lens finding algorithm, to look for lenses in the same sample of galaxies.
  - We were able to find 14 definite lenses, 129 probable lenses and 581 possible lenses

- [Mergers Do Trigger AGNs out to z ∼ 0.6](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.00680)
  - 在GAMA里面用CNN找merger：We find that AGNs are more likely to be found in mergers than non-mergers, with an AGN excess up to 1.81±0.16, suggesting that mergers can trigger AGNs.
  - The fraction of mergers in AGNs is higher than that in non-AGN controls, for both MIR and optically selected AGNs, as well as LERGs 
  - This merger fraction in AGNs increases as stellar mass increases which supports the idea that mergers are more important for triggering AGNs in more massive galaxies.

- [Quantifying the effect of field variance on the Hα luminosity function with the New Numerical Galaxy Catalogue](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.00815)
  - We construct a model of Hα emitters (HAEs) based on a semi-analytic galaxy formation model, the New Numerical Galaxy Catalog
  - We have confirmed that the HAE is a useful tracer for the large-scale structure of the Universe because of their significant overdensity (> 5σ) at clusters and the filamentary structures.
  - The Hα LFs within a survey area of ∼2 deg2 (typical for previous observational studies) show a significant field variance up to ∼1 dex. Based on our model

- [The effect of hydrodynamics alone on the subhalo population in a ΛCDM rich cluster sized dark matter halo](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.00836)
  - We perform a set of non-radiative hydro-dynamical (NHD) simulations of a rich cluster sized dark matter halo...Compared to dark matter only (DMO) simulations of the same halo, subhaloes are less abundant for relatively massive subhaloes, but more abundant for less massive subhaloes.
  - This is mainly because the progenitors of present day low mass subhaloes have larger concentration parameters in the NHD than DMO simulations.
  - The survival number fraction of the accreted low mass progenitors of the main halo at redshift 2 is about 50 percent higher in the NHD than DMO simulations.

- [FLASH Early Science -- Discovery of an intervening HI 21-cm absorber from an ASKAP survey of the GAMA 23 field](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.00847)
  - ASKAP: First Large Absorption Survey in HI (FLASH), a spectroscopically blind survey for 21-cm absorption lines in cold hydrogen HI gas at cosmological distances
  - We have searched for HI absorption towards 1253 radio sources in the GAMA 23 field, covering redshifts between z=0.34 and 0.79 over a sky area of approximately 50 square degrees.
  - Blind巡天中没有找到吸收体：We estimate upper limits on the HI column density frequency distribution function that are consistent with measurements from prior surveys for redshifted optical DLAs
  - 在一个z=0.36的早型星系周围17kpc处找到了3x10^9 Msun的吸收体: Such gas-rich early types are rare, but have been detected in the nearby Universe.

- [A tomographic map of the large-scale matter distribution using the eBOSS Stripe 82 Ly-α forest](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.01448)
  - We investigate the Ly-α forest available in the Stripe 82 field (220deg2), based on the quasar spectra from SDSS Data Release DR16. The density of observed quasar spectra is 37deg−2
  - 比CLAMATO的体积大得多：We derive a 3D map of large-scale matter fluctuations from these data, using a Wiener filter technique.
  - A stack over quasar positions provides a visualization of the Ly-α quasar cross-correlation.

- [The fate of disk galaxies in IllustrisTNG clusters](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.01191)
  - **Relevant**
  - The galaxies' histories are traced from the time of accretion to z=0 and compared to a control sample of central galaxies mass-matched at the time of accretion.
  - Most cluster disks become non-disky by z=0, in stark contrast with the control disks, of which a significant fraction remains disky over the same timescales. 同时伴随着气体移除和SF停滞
  - Cluster disks that become non-disky by z=0 have lost dark matter (DM) mass and show little growth or a loss of stellar mass, whereas the corresponding control disks show significant growth in both components.
  - For cluster disks, the perturbation is in the form of impulsive tidal shocking at pericentres and not tidal stripping of the outer disk stellar material, whereas for control disks, a combination of mergers and AGN feedback appears to be the key driving force behind morphological transformations.

- [Fundamental differences in the radio properties of red and blue quasars: Insight from the LOFAR Two-metre Sky Survey (LoTSS)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.01196)
  - Red quasars: a significant (factor ∼3) enhancement in the radio-detection fraction
  - Compared to a control sample of normal "blue" QSOs matched in redshift and accretion power, red QSOs have a higher radio detection rate and a higher incidence of compact radio morphologies.
  - We also demonstrate that these differences arise primarily in sources of intermediate radio-loudness: radio-intermediate red QSOs are ×3 more common than typical QSOs, but the excess diminishes among the most radio-loud and the most radio-quiet systems in our study.

- [Fundamental differences in the radio properties of red and blue quasars: enhanced compact AGN emission in red quasars](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.01197)
  - 用更深的VLA-S82数据：we perform morphological analyses at a resolution and depth three times that of the FIRST radio survey, and confirm an enhancement in radio-faint and compact red quasars over typical quasars
  - Find tentative evidence for an enhancement in red quasars with slightly extended radio structures
  - From our data we find that the radio enhancement from red quasars is due to AGN activity on compact scales (<43 kpc) for radio-intermediate-radio-quiet sources

- [Infrared Colours and Spectral Energy Distributions of Hard X-ray Selected Obscured and Compton-thick AGN](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.01273)
  - 探索挑选CT-AGN的新方式：We present a new infrared selection for Compton-thick AGN based on MIR and FIR colours ([9μm - 22μm]>3.0 and [22μm - 90μm]<2.7) from WISE and AKARI.
  - Conclude that MIR colours covering 9.7μm silicate absorption and MIR continuum can be a promising new tool to identify Compton-thick AGN.
  - We show that the average covering factor of Compton-thick AGN is higher compared to the obscured and unobscured AGN.

- [A flare in the optical spotted in the changing-look Seyfert NGC 3516](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.01308)
  - During the flare, we observe stronger forbidden high-ionization iron lines than reported before, as well as the complex broad H{\alpha} and H{\beta} lines. This is especially seen in H{\alpha} that appears to be double-peaked. It seems that a very broad component of ~10000 km/s width in the Balmer lines is appearing. 
  - The increase of the continuum emission, the variability of the coronal lines, and the very broad component in the Balmer lines may indicate that AGN of NGC 3516 is finally leaving the low-activity state in which it has been in the last ~3 years.

- [The Nature of Ultra-diffuse Galaxies in Distant Massive Galaxy Clusters: Abell 370 in the Hubble Frontier Fields](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.01340)
  - **Relevant**
  - We find 46 UDGs in Abell 370 from the images of the Hubble Frontier Fields (HFF). 大部分都是red的
  - We estimate the abundance of UDGs in Abell 370, N(UDG)=644±104.
  - The number density profiles of UDGs and bright galaxies show a discrepancy in the central region of the clusters: the profile of UDGs shows a flattening as clustercentric distance decreases, while that of bright galaxies shows a continuous increase.
  - This implies that most UDGs have a dwarf-like origin and a small number of them could be failed L∗ galaxies.

- [A Tidal Disruption Event Candidate Discovered in the Active Galactic Nucleus SDSS J022700.77-042020.6](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.01517)
  - A sudden increase in flux of J0227-0420 during the second half of 2009 is clearly shown in the long-term optical, UV, and NIR light curves. A plateau phase, following an initial decline, is seen in the NUV and optical u, g, r, i light curves. 
  - We find possible evidence that the plateau phase in the NUV band may lag behind the optical ones by approximately 70-80 days with also a much shorter duration
  - The plateaus can be explained if the stellar streams collide with the pre-existing AGN disk at different radii. Though the overall fallback rate decreases, the material in the outer disk gradually drifts inward and increases the local accretion rate at the inner region, producing the optical and UV plateaus.
  - The possible lag between the optical and NUV plateaus can then be attributed to viscosity delay.

- [Molecular Gas Heating and Modified Dust Properties in Active Galaxies: Growing Black Holes or Tidal Shocks?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.01695)
  - We use MIR spectroscopic measurements of emission from rotational H2 transitions, dust and PAH features, and silicate emission or absorption lines at 9.7 microns to study how gravitational interactions impact the warm ISM in AGN and non-AGN hosts.
  - We find that in AGN-hosts, the ISM is warmer, the ratios of H2 to PAHs are larger, the PAH emission line ratios and silicate strengths have a wider range of values than in non-AGN hosts.
