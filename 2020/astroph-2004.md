- [Weak lensing clusters from HSC survey first-year data: Mitigating the dilution effect of foreground and cluster member galaxies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.00170)
  - We adopt the globally normalized weak lensing estimator which is least affected by cluster member galaxies, and we select source galaxies by using photometric redshift information to mitigate the effect of foreground galaxies
  - We find that 107 out of 124 peaks have matched clusters within 5 arcmin from peak positions. Among them, we define a sub-sample of 64 secure clusters that we use to examine dilution effects on our weak lensing peak finding

- [Effect of Active Galactic Nuclei Thermal Heating with Radial Dependence on Thermal Stability of Simulated Galaxy Clusters](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.00021)
  - ENZO模拟校验：Previous analytical work has suggested specific configurations of heating kernels that may result in thermal balance and a steady state.
  - Some heating kernels produced thermally steady galaxy clusters, no kernel was able to produce a steady cluster with a central entropy as low as the central entropies typically observed among CC
  - The simulated clusters enter an unsteady multiphase state on a timescale proportional to the square of the cooling time of the lowest entropy gas in the simulation, with centrally concentrated heating resulting in a steady state lasting for a longer period of time.

- [Why do extremely massive disc galaxies exist today?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.00023)
  - **Relevant**
  - Horizon-AGN里面产生>10^11.4的Disc星系的两个渠道
  - primary channel (accounting for ~70% of these systems and ~8% of massive galaxies) the most recent, significant merger (stellar mass ratio > 1:10) between a massive spheroid and a gas-rich satellite `spins up' the spheroid by creating a new rotational stellar component
  - Secondary channel (accounting for ~30% of these systems and ~3% of massive galaxies), a system maintains a disc throughout its lifetime, due to an anomalously quiet merger history.

- [Clustering of Local Group distances: publication bias or correlated measurements? VII. A distance framework out to 100 Mpc](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.00114)
  - We recommend `best' weighted relative distance moduli for the Fornax and Coma clusters with respect to the Virgo cluster of Δ(m−M)Fornax−Virgo0=0.18±0.28 mag and Δ(m−M)Coma−Virgo0=3.75±0.23 mag. 
  - The absolute and relative distance moduli for both clusters are mutually consistent within the uncertainties; the relative distance moduli yield shorter distances by ∼1σ. Lingering uncertainties in the underlying absolute distance scale appear to have given rise to a systematic uncertainty on the order of 0.20 mag.

- [Outside the Lyman-break box: detecting Lyman continuum emitters at 3.5<z<5.1 with CLAUDS](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.00158)
  - We present a sample of Lyman continuum galaxy (LCG) candidates in the redshift range 3.5≲z≲5.1.
  - 基于BPASS模拟估计：escapte fraction在30-90%之间
  - Stacking candidates without solid LyC detections (S/N<3) results in an estimated fabsesc from galaxies not greater than 1%.

- [A radiative transfer model for the spiral galaxy M33](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.00400)
  - We used the axi-symmetric RT model of Popescu et al. and a new methodology for deriving geometrical parameters, and applied this to decode the{spectral energy distribution (SED) of M33.
  - We predict well the energy balance between absorption and re-emission by dust, with no need to invoke modified grain properties, and we find no submm emission that is in excess of our model predictions.
  - We identify several morphological components in M33, a nuclear, an inner, a main and an outer disc, showing a monotonic trend in decreasing star-formation surface-density

- [A Triple Rollover: A third multiply-imaged source at z~6 behind the Jackpot gravitational lens](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.00649)
  - MUSE观测：we have identified a doubly-imaged Ly α source at redshift 5.975 behind the z = 0.222 lens galaxy J0946+1006
  - 这个系统里之前已经有两个lens-source pair，这是唯一一个triple system
  - The third source also probes two new distance scaling factors which are sensitive to the cosmological parameters of the Universe. 

- [Tight Constraints on the Excess Radio Background at z=9.1 from LOFAR](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.00678)
  - We use the upper limit on the 21-cm signal from the Epoch of Reionization (z = 9.1) based on 141 hours of observations with LOFAR (Mertens et al. 2020) to evaluate the contribution of the high redshift Universe to the detected radio background
  - Even though LOFAR places limit on the extra radio background, excess of 0.1 − 0.7% over the CMB (at 1.42 GHz) is still allowed and could explain the EDGES Low-Band detection

- [The Atacama Cosmology Telescope: A CMB lensing mass map over 2100 square degrees of sky and its cross-correlation with BOSS-CMASS galaxies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.01139)
  - These maps cover 2100 square degrees of sky and overlap with a wide variety of optical surveys
  -  We also create lensing maps with thermal Sunyaev-Zel’dovich contamination removed using a novel cleaning procedure that only slightly degrades the lensing signal-to-noise ratio.
  - The cross-spectrum between the cleaned lensing map and the BOSS CMASS galaxy sample is detected at 10-σ significance, with an amplitude of A = 1.02±0.10 relative to the Planck best-fit LCDM cosmological model with fiducial linear galaxy bias.

- [Survey of Gravitationally-lensed Objects in HSC Imaging (SuGOHI). VI. Crowdsourced lens finding with Space Warps](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.00634)
  - We selected a sample of ∼300,000 galaxies with photometric redshifts in the range 0.2 < zphot < 1.2 and photometrically inferred stellar masses logM∗>11.2.
  - In parallel, we used YattaLens, an automated lens finding algorithm, to look for lenses in the same sample of galaxies.
  - We were able to find 14 definite lenses, 129 probable lenses and 581 possible lenses

- [Mergers Do Trigger AGNs out to z ∼ 0.6](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.00680)
  - 在GAMA里面用CNN找merger：We find that AGNs are more likely to be found in mergers than non-mergers, with an AGN excess up to 1.81±0.16, suggesting that mergers can trigger AGNs.
  - The fraction of mergers in AGNs is higher than that in non-AGN controls, for both MIR and optically selected AGNs, as well as LERGs 
  - This merger fraction in AGNs increases as stellar mass increases which supports the idea that mergers are more important for triggering AGNs in more massive galaxies.

- [Quantifying the effect of field variance on the Hα luminosity function with the New Numerical Galaxy Catalogue](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.00815)
  - We construct a model of Hα emitters (HAEs) based on a semi-analytic galaxy formation model, the New Numerical Galaxy Catalog
  - We have confirmed that the HAE is a useful tracer for the large-scale structure of the Universe because of their significant overdensity (> 5σ) at clusters and the filamentary structures.
  - The Hα LFs within a survey area of ∼2 deg2 (typical for previous observational studies) show a significant field variance up to ∼1 dex. Based on our model

- [The effect of hydrodynamics alone on the subhalo population in a ΛCDM rich cluster sized dark matter halo](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.00836)
  - We perform a set of non-radiative hydro-dynamical (NHD) simulations of a rich cluster sized dark matter halo...Compared to dark matter only (DMO) simulations of the same halo, subhaloes are less abundant for relatively massive subhaloes, but more abundant for less massive subhaloes.
  - This is mainly because the progenitors of present day low mass subhaloes have larger concentration parameters in the NHD than DMO simulations.
  - The survival number fraction of the accreted low mass progenitors of the main halo at redshift 2 is about 50 percent higher in the NHD than DMO simulations.

- [FLASH Early Science -- Discovery of an intervening HI 21-cm absorber from an ASKAP survey of the GAMA 23 field](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.00847)
  - ASKAP: First Large Absorption Survey in HI (FLASH), a spectroscopically blind survey for 21-cm absorption lines in cold hydrogen HI gas at cosmological distances
  - We have searched for HI absorption towards 1253 radio sources in the GAMA 23 field, covering redshifts between z=0.34 and 0.79 over a sky area of approximately 50 square degrees.
  - Blind巡天中没有找到吸收体：We estimate upper limits on the HI column density frequency distribution function that are consistent with measurements from prior surveys for redshifted optical DLAs
  - 在一个z=0.36的早型星系周围17kpc处找到了3x10^9 Msun的吸收体: Such gas-rich early types are rare, but have been detected in the nearby Universe.

### Apr 5

- [A tomographic map of the large-scale matter distribution using the eBOSS Stripe 82 Ly-α forest](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.01448)
  - We investigate the Ly-α forest available in the Stripe 82 field (220deg2), based on the quasar spectra from SDSS Data Release DR16. The density of observed quasar spectra is 37deg−2
  - 比CLAMATO的体积大得多：We derive a 3D map of large-scale matter fluctuations from these data, using a Wiener filter technique.
  - A stack over quasar positions provides a visualization of the Ly-α quasar cross-correlation.

- [The fate of disk galaxies in IllustrisTNG clusters](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.01191)
  - **Relevant**
  - The galaxies' histories are traced from the time of accretion to z=0 and compared to a control sample of central galaxies mass-matched at the time of accretion.
  - Most cluster disks become non-disky by z=0, in stark contrast with the control disks, of which a significant fraction remains disky over the same timescales. 同时伴随着气体移除和SF停滞
  - Cluster disks that become non-disky by z=0 have lost dark matter (DM) mass and show little growth or a loss of stellar mass, whereas the corresponding control disks show significant growth in both components.
  - For cluster disks, the perturbation is in the form of impulsive tidal shocking at pericentres and not tidal stripping of the outer disk stellar material, whereas for control disks, a combination of mergers and AGN feedback appears to be the key driving force behind morphological transformations.

- [Fundamental differences in the radio properties of red and blue quasars: Insight from the LOFAR Two-metre Sky Survey (LoTSS)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.01196)
  - Red quasars: a significant (factor ∼3) enhancement in the radio-detection fraction
  - Compared to a control sample of normal "blue" QSOs matched in redshift and accretion power, red QSOs have a higher radio detection rate and a higher incidence of compact radio morphologies.
  - We also demonstrate that these differences arise primarily in sources of intermediate radio-loudness: radio-intermediate red QSOs are ×3 more common than typical QSOs, but the excess diminishes among the most radio-loud and the most radio-quiet systems in our study.

- [Fundamental differences in the radio properties of red and blue quasars: enhanced compact AGN emission in red quasars](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.01197)
  - 用更深的VLA-S82数据：we perform morphological analyses at a resolution and depth three times that of the FIRST radio survey, and confirm an enhancement in radio-faint and compact red quasars over typical quasars
  - Find tentative evidence for an enhancement in red quasars with slightly extended radio structures
  - From our data we find that the radio enhancement from red quasars is due to AGN activity on compact scales (<43 kpc) for radio-intermediate-radio-quiet sources

- [Infrared Colours and Spectral Energy Distributions of Hard X-ray Selected Obscured and Compton-thick AGN](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.01273)
  - 探索挑选CT-AGN的新方式：We present a new infrared selection for Compton-thick AGN based on MIR and FIR colours ([9μm - 22μm]>3.0 and [22μm - 90μm]<2.7) from WISE and AKARI.
  - Conclude that MIR colours covering 9.7μm silicate absorption and MIR continuum can be a promising new tool to identify Compton-thick AGN.
  - We show that the average covering factor of Compton-thick AGN is higher compared to the obscured and unobscured AGN.

- [A flare in the optical spotted in the changing-look Seyfert NGC 3516](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.01308)
  - During the flare, we observe stronger forbidden high-ionization iron lines than reported before, as well as the complex broad H{\alpha} and H{\beta} lines. This is especially seen in H{\alpha} that appears to be double-peaked. It seems that a very broad component of ~10000 km/s width in the Balmer lines is appearing. 
  - The increase of the continuum emission, the variability of the coronal lines, and the very broad component in the Balmer lines may indicate that AGN of NGC 3516 is finally leaving the low-activity state in which it has been in the last ~3 years.

- [The Nature of Ultra-diffuse Galaxies in Distant Massive Galaxy Clusters: Abell 370 in the Hubble Frontier Fields](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.01340)
  - **Relevant**
  - We find 46 UDGs in Abell 370 from the images of the Hubble Frontier Fields (HFF). 大部分都是red的
  - We estimate the abundance of UDGs in Abell 370, N(UDG)=644±104.
  - The number density profiles of UDGs and bright galaxies show a discrepancy in the central region of the clusters: the profile of UDGs shows a flattening as clustercentric distance decreases, while that of bright galaxies shows a continuous increase.
  - This implies that most UDGs have a dwarf-like origin and a small number of them could be failed L∗ galaxies.

- [A Tidal Disruption Event Candidate Discovered in the Active Galactic Nucleus SDSS J022700.77-042020.6](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.01517)
  - A sudden increase in flux of J0227-0420 during the second half of 2009 is clearly shown in the long-term optical, UV, and NIR light curves. A plateau phase, following an initial decline, is seen in the NUV and optical u, g, r, i light curves. 
  - We find possible evidence that the plateau phase in the NUV band may lag behind the optical ones by approximately 70-80 days with also a much shorter duration
  - The plateaus can be explained if the stellar streams collide with the pre-existing AGN disk at different radii. Though the overall fallback rate decreases, the material in the outer disk gradually drifts inward and increases the local accretion rate at the inner region, producing the optical and UV plateaus.
  - The possible lag between the optical and NUV plateaus can then be attributed to viscosity delay.

- [Molecular Gas Heating and Modified Dust Properties in Active Galaxies: Growing Black Holes or Tidal Shocks?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.01695)
  - We use MIR spectroscopic measurements of emission from rotational H2 transitions, dust and PAH features, and silicate emission or absorption lines at 9.7 microns to study how gravitational interactions impact the warm ISM in AGN and non-AGN hosts.
  - We find that in AGN-hosts, the ISM is warmer, the ratios of H2 to PAHs are larger, the PAH emission line ratios and silicate strengths have a wider range of values than in non-AGN hosts.

### Apr 6

- [Free-form Grale lens inversion of galaxy clusters with up to 1000 multiple images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.01724)
  - We scrutinize the performance of the free-form lens inversion method Grale in the regime of 150−1000 input images, using synthetic massive galaxy clusters.
  - While the fidelity of the reconstruction improves with the increasing number of multiple images used as model constraints, ∼150 to ∼1000, the lens plane rms deteriorates from ∼0.11″ to ∼0.28″. Since lens plane rms is not necessarily the best indicator of the quality of the mass reconstructions, looking for an alternative indicator is warranted.

- [The Effect of Massive Neutrinos on the Galaxy Spin Flip Phenomenon](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.02638)
  - The galaxy spin flip refers to the phenomenon that the spin axes of galaxies with masses above a certain threshold tend to be preferentially aligned perpendicular to the hosting large-scale filaments, while low mass or early type galaxies tend to have their spin axes aligned parallel to such structures.
  - We present, for the first time, a numerical examination of this phenomenon assuming the presence of massive neutrinos, finding a clear and robust dependence of the threshold mass for the spin flip on the total neutrino mass.
  - Our physical explanation is that the presence of more massive neutrinos retard the nonlinear evolution of the cosmic web, which in turn allows the galaxy spin vectors to better retain their memories of the initial tidal interactions even in the highly nonlinear regime.

- [Optical and X-ray discovery of the changing-look AGN IRAS23226-3843 showing extremely broad and double-peaked Balmer profiles](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.01711)
  - We detected a very strong X-ray decline in the galaxy IRAS23226-3843 within the XMM-Newton slew survey in 2017
  - IRAS23226-3843 decreased in X-rays by a factor of more than 30 with respect to ROSAT and Swift data taken 10 to 27 years before.
  - The optical continuum decreased by 60 percent and the Balmer line intensities decreased by 50 percent between 1999 and 2017. The optical Seyfert spectral type changed simultaneously with the X-ray flux from a clear broad-line Seyfert 1 type in 1999 to a Seyfert 1.9 type in 2017
  - The unusual flat Balmer decrement Ha/Hb with a value of 2 indicates a very high hydrogen density of n_(H) > 10 exp(11) cm^(-3) at the center of the accretion disk. IRAS23226-3843 shows unusually strong FeII blends with respect to the broad line widths, in contrast to what is known from Eigenvector 1 studies.

- [Atacama Compact Array Measurements of the Molecular Mass in the NGC 5044 Cooling Flow Group](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.01717)
  - **Relevant**
  - NGC5044,一个X-ray bright group的中心星系：using the 7m array data, that we can recover the total flux inferred from IRAM 30m single dish observations, which corresponds to a total molecular mass of about 4x10^7 Msun.
  - We find 8 concentrations of molecular gas out to a radius of 10 arcsec (1.5 kpc), which we identify with giant molecular clouds. 
  - We find two CO absorption features spatially located at the center of the galaxy, within 5 pc projected distance of the AGN, infalling at 255 and 265 km/s relative to the AGN. This indicates that the two giant molecular clouds seen in absorption are most likely within the sphere of influence of the supermassive black hole.

- [A joint SZ-Xray-optical analysis of the dynamical state of 288 massive galaxy clusters](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.01721)
  - **Relevant**
  - We examine spatial offsets between the position of the brightest cluster galaxy (BCG) and the center of the gas distribution as traced by the SPT-SZ centroid and by the X-ray centroid/peak position from Chandra and XMM data. We show that the radial distribution of offsets provides no evidence that SPT SZ-selected cluster samples include a higher fraction of mergers than X-ray-selected cluster samples.
  - We find that Schechter function fits to the galaxy population in disturbed clusters and relaxed clusters differ at z>0.55 but not at lower redshifts.
  - Within the same redshift range, we find that the BCGs in relaxed clusters tend to be brighter than the BCGs in disturbed samples, while in agreement in the lower redshift bin.

- [Molecular gas in CLASH brightest cluster galaxies at z∼0.2−0.9](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.01786)
  - **Relevant**
  - We have observed in CO(1-0), CO(2-1), CO(3-2), or CO(4-3), with the IRAM-30m, 18 BCGs at z∼0.2−0.9 that are drawn from the CLASH survey.
  - 在恒星形成率最高的RX1532中探测到了大量分子气体；We tentatively detected CO(1-0) or CO(2-1) in four other BCGs；For the remaining 13 BCGs we set robust upper limits of MH2/M⋆≲0.1,
  - By comparison with distant cluster galaxies observed in CO our study shows that RX1532 (MH2/M⋆=0.40±0.05) belongs to the rare population of star forming and gas-rich BCGs in the distant universe.

- [The ARTEMIS simulations: stellar haloes of Milky Way-mass galaxies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.01914)
  - **Relevant**
  - A new set of 42 zoomed-in, high-resolution (baryon particle mass of ~ 2x10^4 Msun/h)
  - The stellar density profiles are well fitted by broken power laws, with inner slopes of ~ -3, outer slopes of ~ -4 and break radii that are typically ~ 20-40 kpc. The break radii generally mark the transition between in situ formation and accretion-driven formation of the halo.
  - Overall, the structural properties can be understood by two factors: that in situ stars dominate the inner regions and that they reside in a spatially-flattened distribution that is aligned with the disc. Observations targeting both the major and minor axes of galaxies are thus required to obtain a complete picture of stellar haloes.

- [Luminosity-duration relations and luminosity functions of repeating and non-repeating fast radio bursts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.02079)
  - **Interesting**
  - Here we show the time-integrated luminosity-duration (Lν-wint,rest) relations and luminosity functions (LFs) of repeating and non-repeating FRBs in the FRB Catalogue project. 两类FRB明显不一样。
  - Repeating FRBs have relatively fainter Lν and longer wint,rest with a much lower LF. 
  - Repeating FRBs do not show any clear correlation between Lν and wint,rest，而非再现FRB则有此相关
  - The faint ends of the LFs of repeating and non-repeating FRBs are higher than volumetric occurrence rates of neutron-star mergers and accretion-induced collapse (AIC) of white dwarfs, and are consistent with those of soft gamma-ray repeaters (SGRs), type Ia supernovae, magnetars, and white-dwarf mergers.
  - The bright ends of LFs of repeating and non-repeating FRBs are lower than any candidates of progenitors, suggesting that bright FRBs are produced from a very small fraction of the progenitors regardless of the repetition. Otherwise, they might originate in unknown progenitors.

- [Star Formation Enhancement in Barred Disk Galaxies in Interacting Galaxy Clusters](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.02204)
  - We find that fsf is moderately higher (∼20%) in interacting clusters than in non-interacting clusters and that the enhancement of star formation in interacting clusters occurs only in moderate-mass disk-dominated galaxies.
  - We also find that the enhancement of fsf in moderate-mass disk-dominated galaxies in interacting clusters is mostly due to the increase of the number of barred galaxies. Our result suggests that the cluster-cluster interaction can simultaneously induce bars and star formation in disk galaxies. 

- [Ultradense Gases beyond Dusty Torus in a Partially Obscured Quasar](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.02436)
  - Here we report the detection of clear and rich emission lines origin from the scale of dusty tours in an partially obscured quasar 
  - We interpret this as the lines being excited by a shock induced by the high-density and high-temperature gases at the scale of dusty torus, rather than photo-ionized by the central accretion disk. 

- [Infrared luminosity functions and dust mass functions in the EAGLE simulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.02713)
  - 利用SKIRT看EAGLE中的dust mass function和IRLF；in the high luminosity regime, where the EAGLE-SKIRT luminosity functions mildly but systematically underestimate the observed ones.
  - The agreement between the EAGLE-SKIRT infrared luminosity functions and the observed ones gradually worsens with increasing lookback time.
  - The mild evolution of the dust mass density is in relatively good agreement with observations, but the slow evolution of the infrared luminosity underestimates the observed luminosity evolution significantly.

- [New high-quality strong lens candidates with deep learning in the Kilo Degree Survey](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.02715)
  - We have developed a new Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) classifier to search for gravitational arcs, following the prescription by Petrillo et al. 2019 and using only r−band images
  - We have found 286 new high probability candidates, 133 from the LRG sample and 153 from the BG sample.
