- [Weak lensing clusters from HSC survey first-year data: Mitigating the dilution effect of foreground and cluster member galaxies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.00170)
  - We adopt the globally normalized weak lensing estimator which is least affected by cluster member galaxies, and we select source galaxies by using photometric redshift information to mitigate the effect of foreground galaxies
  - We find that 107 out of 124 peaks have matched clusters within 5 arcmin from peak positions. Among them, we define a sub-sample of 64 secure clusters that we use to examine dilution effects on our weak lensing peak finding

- [Effect of Active Galactic Nuclei Thermal Heating with Radial Dependence on Thermal Stability of Simulated Galaxy Clusters](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.00021)
  - ENZO模拟校验：Previous analytical work has suggested specific configurations of heating kernels that may result in thermal balance and a steady state.
  - Some heating kernels produced thermally steady galaxy clusters, no kernel was able to produce a steady cluster with a central entropy as low as the central entropies typically observed among CC
  - The simulated clusters enter an unsteady multiphase state on a timescale proportional to the square of the cooling time of the lowest entropy gas in the simulation, with centrally concentrated heating resulting in a steady state lasting for a longer period of time.

- [Why do extremely massive disc galaxies exist today?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.00023)
  - **Relevant**
  - Horizon-AGN里面产生>10^11.4的Disc星系的两个渠道
  - primary channel (accounting for ~70% of these systems and ~8% of massive galaxies) the most recent, significant merger (stellar mass ratio > 1:10) between a massive spheroid and a gas-rich satellite `spins up' the spheroid by creating a new rotational stellar component
  - Secondary channel (accounting for ~30% of these systems and ~3% of massive galaxies), a system maintains a disc throughout its lifetime, due to an anomalously quiet merger history.

- [Clustering of Local Group distances: publication bias or correlated measurements? VII. A distance framework out to 100 Mpc](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.00114)
  - We recommend `best' weighted relative distance moduli for the Fornax and Coma clusters with respect to the Virgo cluster of Δ(m−M)Fornax−Virgo0=0.18±0.28 mag and Δ(m−M)Coma−Virgo0=3.75±0.23 mag. 
  - The absolute and relative distance moduli for both clusters are mutually consistent within the uncertainties; the relative distance moduli yield shorter distances by ∼1σ. Lingering uncertainties in the underlying absolute distance scale appear to have given rise to a systematic uncertainty on the order of 0.20 mag.

- [Outside the Lyman-break box: detecting Lyman continuum emitters at 3.5<z<5.1 with CLAUDS](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.00158)
  - We present a sample of Lyman continuum galaxy (LCG) candidates in the redshift range 3.5≲z≲5.1.
  - 基于BPASS模拟估计：escapte fraction在30-90%之间
  - Stacking candidates without solid LyC detections (S/N<3) results in an estimated fabsesc from galaxies not greater than 1%.

- [A radiative transfer model for the spiral galaxy M33](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.00400)
  - We used the axi-symmetric RT model of Popescu et al. and a new methodology for deriving geometrical parameters, and applied this to decode the{spectral energy distribution (SED) of M33.
  - We predict well the energy balance between absorption and re-emission by dust, with no need to invoke modified grain properties, and we find no submm emission that is in excess of our model predictions.
  - We identify several morphological components in M33, a nuclear, an inner, a main and an outer disc, showing a monotonic trend in decreasing star-formation surface-density
