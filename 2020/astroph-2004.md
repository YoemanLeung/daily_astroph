- [Weak lensing clusters from HSC survey first-year data: Mitigating the dilution effect of foreground and cluster member galaxies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.00170)
  - We adopt the globally normalized weak lensing estimator which is least affected by cluster member galaxies, and we select source galaxies by using photometric redshift information to mitigate the effect of foreground galaxies
  - We find that 107 out of 124 peaks have matched clusters within 5 arcmin from peak positions. Among them, we define a sub-sample of 64 secure clusters that we use to examine dilution effects on our weak lensing peak finding

- [Effect of Active Galactic Nuclei Thermal Heating with Radial Dependence on Thermal Stability of Simulated Galaxy Clusters](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.00021)
  - ENZO模拟校验：Previous analytical work has suggested specific configurations of heating kernels that may result in thermal balance and a steady state.
  - Some heating kernels produced thermally steady galaxy clusters, no kernel was able to produce a steady cluster with a central entropy as low as the central entropies typically observed among CC
  - The simulated clusters enter an unsteady multiphase state on a timescale proportional to the square of the cooling time of the lowest entropy gas in the simulation, with centrally concentrated heating resulting in a steady state lasting for a longer period of time.

- [Why do extremely massive disc galaxies exist today?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.00023)
  - **Relevant**
  - Horizon-AGN里面产生>10^11.4的Disc星系的两个渠道
  - primary channel (accounting for ~70% of these systems and ~8% of massive galaxies) the most recent, significant merger (stellar mass ratio > 1:10) between a massive spheroid and a gas-rich satellite `spins up' the spheroid by creating a new rotational stellar component
  - Secondary channel (accounting for ~30% of these systems and ~3% of massive galaxies), a system maintains a disc throughout its lifetime, due to an anomalously quiet merger history.

- [Clustering of Local Group distances: publication bias or correlated measurements? VII. A distance framework out to 100 Mpc](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.00114)
  - We recommend `best' weighted relative distance moduli for the Fornax and Coma clusters with respect to the Virgo cluster of Δ(m−M)Fornax−Virgo0=0.18±0.28 mag and Δ(m−M)Coma−Virgo0=3.75±0.23 mag.
  - The absolute and relative distance moduli for both clusters are mutually consistent within the uncertainties; the relative distance moduli yield shorter distances by ∼1σ. Lingering uncertainties in the underlying absolute distance scale appear to have given rise to a systematic uncertainty on the order of 0.20 mag.

- [Outside the Lyman-break box: detecting Lyman continuum emitters at 3.5<z<5.1 with CLAUDS](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.00158)
  - We present a sample of Lyman continuum galaxy (LCG) candidates in the redshift range 3.5≲z≲5.1.
  - 基于BPASS模拟估计：escapte fraction在30-90%之间
  - Stacking candidates without solid LyC detections (S/N<3) results in an estimated fabsesc from galaxies not greater than 1%.

- [A radiative transfer model for the spiral galaxy M33](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.00400)
  - We used the axi-symmetric RT model of Popescu et al. and a new methodology for deriving geometrical parameters, and applied this to decode the{spectral energy distribution (SED) of M33.
  - We predict well the energy balance between absorption and re-emission by dust, with no need to invoke modified grain properties, and we find no submm emission that is in excess of our model predictions.
  - We identify several morphological components in M33, a nuclear, an inner, a main and an outer disc, showing a monotonic trend in decreasing star-formation surface-density

### Apr 2

- [A Triple Rollover: A third multiply-imaged source at z~6 behind the Jackpot gravitational lens](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.00649)
  - MUSE观测：we have identified a doubly-imaged Ly α source at redshift 5.975 behind the z = 0.222 lens galaxy J0946+1006
  - 这个系统里之前已经有两个lens-source pair，这是唯一一个triple system
  - The third source also probes two new distance scaling factors which are sensitive to the cosmological parameters of the Universe.

- [Tight Constraints on the Excess Radio Background at z=9.1 from LOFAR](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.00678)
  - We use the upper limit on the 21-cm signal from the Epoch of Reionization (z = 9.1) based on 141 hours of observations with LOFAR (Mertens et al. 2020) to evaluate the contribution of the high redshift Universe to the detected radio background
  - Even though LOFAR places limit on the extra radio background, excess of 0.1 − 0.7% over the CMB (at 1.42 GHz) is still allowed and could explain the EDGES Low-Band detection

- [The Atacama Cosmology Telescope: A CMB lensing mass map over 2100 square degrees of sky and its cross-correlation with BOSS-CMASS galaxies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.01139)
  - These maps cover 2100 square degrees of sky and overlap with a wide variety of optical surveys
  -  We also create lensing maps with thermal Sunyaev-Zel’dovich contamination removed using a novel cleaning procedure that only slightly degrades the lensing signal-to-noise ratio.
  - The cross-spectrum between the cleaned lensing map and the BOSS CMASS galaxy sample is detected at 10-σ significance, with an amplitude of A = 1.02±0.10 relative to the Planck best-fit LCDM cosmological model with fiducial linear galaxy bias.

- [Survey of Gravitationally-lensed Objects in HSC Imaging (SuGOHI). VI. Crowdsourced lens finding with Space Warps](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.00634)
  - We selected a sample of ∼300,000 galaxies with photometric redshifts in the range 0.2 < zphot < 1.2 and photometrically inferred stellar masses logM∗>11.2.
  - In parallel, we used YattaLens, an automated lens finding algorithm, to look for lenses in the same sample of galaxies.
  - We were able to find 14 definite lenses, 129 probable lenses and 581 possible lenses

- [Mergers Do Trigger AGNs out to z ∼ 0.6](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.00680)
  - 在GAMA里面用CNN找merger：We find that AGNs are more likely to be found in mergers than non-mergers, with an AGN excess up to 1.81±0.16, suggesting that mergers can trigger AGNs.
  - The fraction of mergers in AGNs is higher than that in non-AGN controls, for both MIR and optically selected AGNs, as well as LERGs
  - This merger fraction in AGNs increases as stellar mass increases which supports the idea that mergers are more important for triggering AGNs in more massive galaxies.

- [Quantifying the effect of field variance on the Hα luminosity function with the New Numerical Galaxy Catalogue](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.00815)
  - We construct a model of Hα emitters (HAEs) based on a semi-analytic galaxy formation model, the New Numerical Galaxy Catalog
  - We have confirmed that the HAE is a useful tracer for the large-scale structure of the Universe because of their significant overdensity (> 5σ) at clusters and the filamentary structures.
  - The Hα LFs within a survey area of ∼2 deg2 (typical for previous observational studies) show a significant field variance up to ∼1 dex. Based on our model

- [The effect of hydrodynamics alone on the subhalo population in a ΛCDM rich cluster sized dark matter halo](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.00836)
  - We perform a set of non-radiative hydro-dynamical (NHD) simulations of a rich cluster sized dark matter halo...Compared to dark matter only (DMO) simulations of the same halo, subhaloes are less abundant for relatively massive subhaloes, but more abundant for less massive subhaloes.
  - This is mainly because the progenitors of present day low mass subhaloes have larger concentration parameters in the NHD than DMO simulations.
  - The survival number fraction of the accreted low mass progenitors of the main halo at redshift 2 is about 50 percent higher in the NHD than DMO simulations.

- [FLASH Early Science -- Discovery of an intervening HI 21-cm absorber from an ASKAP survey of the GAMA 23 field](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.00847)
  - ASKAP: First Large Absorption Survey in HI (FLASH), a spectroscopically blind survey for 21-cm absorption lines in cold hydrogen HI gas at cosmological distances
  - We have searched for HI absorption towards 1253 radio sources in the GAMA 23 field, covering redshifts between z=0.34 and 0.79 over a sky area of approximately 50 square degrees.
  - Blind巡天中没有找到吸收体：We estimate upper limits on the HI column density frequency distribution function that are consistent with measurements from prior surveys for redshifted optical DLAs
  - 在一个z=0.36的早型星系周围17kpc处找到了3x10^9 Msun的吸收体: Such gas-rich early types are rare, but have been detected in the nearby Universe.

### Apr 5

- [A tomographic map of the large-scale matter distribution using the eBOSS Stripe 82 Ly-α forest](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.01448)
  - We investigate the Ly-α forest available in the Stripe 82 field (220deg2), based on the quasar spectra from SDSS Data Release DR16. The density of observed quasar spectra is 37deg−2
  - 比CLAMATO的体积大得多：We derive a 3D map of large-scale matter fluctuations from these data, using a Wiener filter technique.
  - A stack over quasar positions provides a visualization of the Ly-α quasar cross-correlation.

- [The fate of disk galaxies in IllustrisTNG clusters](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.01191)
  - **Relevant**
  - The galaxies' histories are traced from the time of accretion to z=0 and compared to a control sample of central galaxies mass-matched at the time of accretion.
  - Most cluster disks become non-disky by z=0, in stark contrast with the control disks, of which a significant fraction remains disky over the same timescales. 同时伴随着气体移除和SF停滞
  - Cluster disks that become non-disky by z=0 have lost dark matter (DM) mass and show little growth or a loss of stellar mass, whereas the corresponding control disks show significant growth in both components.
  - For cluster disks, the perturbation is in the form of impulsive tidal shocking at pericentres and not tidal stripping of the outer disk stellar material, whereas for control disks, a combination of mergers and AGN feedback appears to be the key driving force behind morphological transformations.

- [Fundamental differences in the radio properties of red and blue quasars: Insight from the LOFAR Two-metre Sky Survey (LoTSS)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.01196)
  - Red quasars: a significant (factor ∼3) enhancement in the radio-detection fraction
  - Compared to a control sample of normal "blue" QSOs matched in redshift and accretion power, red QSOs have a higher radio detection rate and a higher incidence of compact radio morphologies.
  - We also demonstrate that these differences arise primarily in sources of intermediate radio-loudness: radio-intermediate red QSOs are ×3 more common than typical QSOs, but the excess diminishes among the most radio-loud and the most radio-quiet systems in our study.

- [Fundamental differences in the radio properties of red and blue quasars: enhanced compact AGN emission in red quasars](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.01197)
  - 用更深的VLA-S82数据：we perform morphological analyses at a resolution and depth three times that of the FIRST radio survey, and confirm an enhancement in radio-faint and compact red quasars over typical quasars
  - Find tentative evidence for an enhancement in red quasars with slightly extended radio structures
  - From our data we find that the radio enhancement from red quasars is due to AGN activity on compact scales (<43 kpc) for radio-intermediate-radio-quiet sources

- [Infrared Colours and Spectral Energy Distributions of Hard X-ray Selected Obscured and Compton-thick AGN](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.01273)
  - 探索挑选CT-AGN的新方式：We present a new infrared selection for Compton-thick AGN based on MIR and FIR colours ([9μm - 22μm]>3.0 and [22μm - 90μm]<2.7) from WISE and AKARI.
  - Conclude that MIR colours covering 9.7μm silicate absorption and MIR continuum can be a promising new tool to identify Compton-thick AGN.
  - We show that the average covering factor of Compton-thick AGN is higher compared to the obscured and unobscured AGN.

- [A flare in the optical spotted in the changing-look Seyfert NGC 3516](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.01308)
  - During the flare, we observe stronger forbidden high-ionization iron lines than reported before, as well as the complex broad H{\alpha} and H{\beta} lines. This is especially seen in H{\alpha} that appears to be double-peaked. It seems that a very broad component of ~10000 km/s width in the Balmer lines is appearing.
  - The increase of the continuum emission, the variability of the coronal lines, and the very broad component in the Balmer lines may indicate that AGN of NGC 3516 is finally leaving the low-activity state in which it has been in the last ~3 years.

- [The Nature of Ultra-diffuse Galaxies in Distant Massive Galaxy Clusters: Abell 370 in the Hubble Frontier Fields](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.01340)
  - **Relevant**
  - We find 46 UDGs in Abell 370 from the images of the Hubble Frontier Fields (HFF). 大部分都是red的
  - We estimate the abundance of UDGs in Abell 370, N(UDG)=644±104.
  - The number density profiles of UDGs and bright galaxies show a discrepancy in the central region of the clusters: the profile of UDGs shows a flattening as clustercentric distance decreases, while that of bright galaxies shows a continuous increase.
  - This implies that most UDGs have a dwarf-like origin and a small number of them could be failed L∗ galaxies.

- [A Tidal Disruption Event Candidate Discovered in the Active Galactic Nucleus SDSS J022700.77-042020.6](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.01517)
  - A sudden increase in flux of J0227-0420 during the second half of 2009 is clearly shown in the long-term optical, UV, and NIR light curves. A plateau phase, following an initial decline, is seen in the NUV and optical u, g, r, i light curves.
  - We find possible evidence that the plateau phase in the NUV band may lag behind the optical ones by approximately 70-80 days with also a much shorter duration
  - The plateaus can be explained if the stellar streams collide with the pre-existing AGN disk at different radii. Though the overall fallback rate decreases, the material in the outer disk gradually drifts inward and increases the local accretion rate at the inner region, producing the optical and UV plateaus.
  - The possible lag between the optical and NUV plateaus can then be attributed to viscosity delay.

- [Molecular Gas Heating and Modified Dust Properties in Active Galaxies: Growing Black Holes or Tidal Shocks?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.01695)
  - We use MIR spectroscopic measurements of emission from rotational H2 transitions, dust and PAH features, and silicate emission or absorption lines at 9.7 microns to study how gravitational interactions impact the warm ISM in AGN and non-AGN hosts.
  - We find that in AGN-hosts, the ISM is warmer, the ratios of H2 to PAHs are larger, the PAH emission line ratios and silicate strengths have a wider range of values than in non-AGN hosts.

### Apr 6

- [Free-form Grale lens inversion of galaxy clusters with up to 1000 multiple images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.01724)
  - We scrutinize the performance of the free-form lens inversion method Grale in the regime of 150−1000 input images, using synthetic massive galaxy clusters.
  - While the fidelity of the reconstruction improves with the increasing number of multiple images used as model constraints, ∼150 to ∼1000, the lens plane rms deteriorates from ∼0.11″ to ∼0.28″. Since lens plane rms is not necessarily the best indicator of the quality of the mass reconstructions, looking for an alternative indicator is warranted.

- [The Effect of Massive Neutrinos on the Galaxy Spin Flip Phenomenon](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.02638)
  - The galaxy spin flip refers to the phenomenon that the spin axes of galaxies with masses above a certain threshold tend to be preferentially aligned perpendicular to the hosting large-scale filaments, while low mass or early type galaxies tend to have their spin axes aligned parallel to such structures.
  - We present, for the first time, a numerical examination of this phenomenon assuming the presence of massive neutrinos, finding a clear and robust dependence of the threshold mass for the spin flip on the total neutrino mass.
  - Our physical explanation is that the presence of more massive neutrinos retard the nonlinear evolution of the cosmic web, which in turn allows the galaxy spin vectors to better retain their memories of the initial tidal interactions even in the highly nonlinear regime.

- [Optical and X-ray discovery of the changing-look AGN IRAS23226-3843 showing extremely broad and double-peaked Balmer profiles](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.01711)
  - We detected a very strong X-ray decline in the galaxy IRAS23226-3843 within the XMM-Newton slew survey in 2017
  - IRAS23226-3843 decreased in X-rays by a factor of more than 30 with respect to ROSAT and Swift data taken 10 to 27 years before.
  - The optical continuum decreased by 60 percent and the Balmer line intensities decreased by 50 percent between 1999 and 2017. The optical Seyfert spectral type changed simultaneously with the X-ray flux from a clear broad-line Seyfert 1 type in 1999 to a Seyfert 1.9 type in 2017
  - The unusual flat Balmer decrement Ha/Hb with a value of 2 indicates a very high hydrogen density of n_(H) > 10 exp(11) cm^(-3) at the center of the accretion disk. IRAS23226-3843 shows unusually strong FeII blends with respect to the broad line widths, in contrast to what is known from Eigenvector 1 studies.

- [Atacama Compact Array Measurements of the Molecular Mass in the NGC 5044 Cooling Flow Group](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.01717)
  - **Relevant**
  - NGC5044,一个X-ray bright group的中心星系：using the 7m array data, that we can recover the total flux inferred from IRAM 30m single dish observations, which corresponds to a total molecular mass of about 4x10^7 Msun.
  - We find 8 concentrations of molecular gas out to a radius of 10 arcsec (1.5 kpc), which we identify with giant molecular clouds.
  - We find two CO absorption features spatially located at the center of the galaxy, within 5 pc projected distance of the AGN, infalling at 255 and 265 km/s relative to the AGN. This indicates that the two giant molecular clouds seen in absorption are most likely within the sphere of influence of the supermassive black hole.

- [A joint SZ-Xray-optical analysis of the dynamical state of 288 massive galaxy clusters](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.01721)
  - **Relevant**
  - We examine spatial offsets between the position of the brightest cluster galaxy (BCG) and the center of the gas distribution as traced by the SPT-SZ centroid and by the X-ray centroid/peak position from Chandra and XMM data. We show that the radial distribution of offsets provides no evidence that SPT SZ-selected cluster samples include a higher fraction of mergers than X-ray-selected cluster samples.
  - We find that Schechter function fits to the galaxy population in disturbed clusters and relaxed clusters differ at z>0.55 but not at lower redshifts.
  - Within the same redshift range, we find that the BCGs in relaxed clusters tend to be brighter than the BCGs in disturbed samples, while in agreement in the lower redshift bin.

- [Molecular gas in CLASH brightest cluster galaxies at z∼0.2−0.9](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.01786)
  - **Relevant**
  - We have observed in CO(1-0), CO(2-1), CO(3-2), or CO(4-3), with the IRAM-30m, 18 BCGs at z∼0.2−0.9 that are drawn from the CLASH survey.
  - 在恒星形成率最高的RX1532中探测到了大量分子气体；We tentatively detected CO(1-0) or CO(2-1) in four other BCGs；For the remaining 13 BCGs we set robust upper limits of MH2/M⋆≲0.1,
  - By comparison with distant cluster galaxies observed in CO our study shows that RX1532 (MH2/M⋆=0.40±0.05) belongs to the rare population of star forming and gas-rich BCGs in the distant universe.

- [The ARTEMIS simulations: stellar haloes of Milky Way-mass galaxies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.01914)
  - **Relevant**
  - A new set of 42 zoomed-in, high-resolution (baryon particle mass of ~ 2x10^4 Msun/h)
  - The stellar density profiles are well fitted by broken power laws, with inner slopes of ~ -3, outer slopes of ~ -4 and break radii that are typically ~ 20-40 kpc. The break radii generally mark the transition between in situ formation and accretion-driven formation of the halo.
  - Overall, the structural properties can be understood by two factors: that in situ stars dominate the inner regions and that they reside in a spatially-flattened distribution that is aligned with the disc. Observations targeting both the major and minor axes of galaxies are thus required to obtain a complete picture of stellar haloes.

- [Luminosity-duration relations and luminosity functions of repeating and non-repeating fast radio bursts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.02079)
  - **Interesting**
  - Here we show the time-integrated luminosity-duration (Lν-wint,rest) relations and luminosity functions (LFs) of repeating and non-repeating FRBs in the FRB Catalogue project. 两类FRB明显不一样。
  - Repeating FRBs have relatively fainter Lν and longer wint,rest with a much lower LF.
  - Repeating FRBs do not show any clear correlation between Lν and wint,rest，而非再现FRB则有此相关
  - The faint ends of the LFs of repeating and non-repeating FRBs are higher than volumetric occurrence rates of neutron-star mergers and accretion-induced collapse (AIC) of white dwarfs, and are consistent with those of soft gamma-ray repeaters (SGRs), type Ia supernovae, magnetars, and white-dwarf mergers.
  - The bright ends of LFs of repeating and non-repeating FRBs are lower than any candidates of progenitors, suggesting that bright FRBs are produced from a very small fraction of the progenitors regardless of the repetition. Otherwise, they might originate in unknown progenitors.

- [Star Formation Enhancement in Barred Disk Galaxies in Interacting Galaxy Clusters](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.02204)
  - We find that fsf is moderately higher (∼20%) in interacting clusters than in non-interacting clusters and that the enhancement of star formation in interacting clusters occurs only in moderate-mass disk-dominated galaxies.
  - We also find that the enhancement of fsf in moderate-mass disk-dominated galaxies in interacting clusters is mostly due to the increase of the number of barred galaxies. Our result suggests that the cluster-cluster interaction can simultaneously induce bars and star formation in disk galaxies.

- [Ultradense Gases beyond Dusty Torus in a Partially Obscured Quasar](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.02436)
  - Here we report the detection of clear and rich emission lines origin from the scale of dusty tours in an partially obscured quasar
  - We interpret this as the lines being excited by a shock induced by the high-density and high-temperature gases at the scale of dusty torus, rather than photo-ionized by the central accretion disk.

- [Infrared luminosity functions and dust mass functions in the EAGLE simulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.02713)
  - 利用SKIRT看EAGLE中的dust mass function和IRLF；in the high luminosity regime, where the EAGLE-SKIRT luminosity functions mildly but systematically underestimate the observed ones.
  - The agreement between the EAGLE-SKIRT infrared luminosity functions and the observed ones gradually worsens with increasing lookback time.
  - The mild evolution of the dust mass density is in relatively good agreement with observations, but the slow evolution of the infrared luminosity underestimates the observed luminosity evolution significantly.

- [New high-quality strong lens candidates with deep learning in the Kilo Degree Survey](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.02715)
  - We have developed a new Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) classifier to search for gravitational arcs, following the prescription by Petrillo et al. 2019 and using only r−band images
  - We have found 286 new high probability candidates, 133 from the LRG sample and 153 from the BG sample.

### Apr 7

- [Probing cosmic isotropy with a new X-ray galaxy cluster sample through the LX−T scaling relation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.03305)
  - **Interesting, Important**
  - We used 313 homogeneously selected X-ray galaxy clusters from the Meta-Catalogue of X-ray detected Clusters of galaxies (MCXC).
  - The behavior of the LX − T relation heavily depends on the direction of the sky, which is consistent with previous studies. Strong anisotropies are detected at a & 4σ confidence level toward the Galactic coordinates (l, b) ∼ (280◦, −20◦),
  - 可能的systematic解释：, the X-ray absorption treatment, the effect of galaxy groups and low redshift clusters, core metallicities, and apparent correlations with other cluster properties, but none is able to explain the obtained results.
  - The maximum variation of DL seems to be ∼ 16 ± 3% for different regions in the sky. This result demonstrates that X-ray studies that assume perfect isotropy in the properties of galaxy clusters and their scaling relations can produce strongly biased results whether the underlying reason is cosmological or related to X-rays.

- [A Hard X-ray Test of HCN Enhancements as a Tracer of Embedded Black Hole Growth](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.02884)
  - HCN/HCO+比例可否作为AGN判据：we identified galaxies with HCN/HCO+ (1-0) intensity ratios consistent with those of many AGN but whose mid-infrared spectral diagnostics are consistent with little to no ( ≲15%) contribution of an AGN to the bolometric luminosity.
  - We find no X-ray evidence for AGN in three of the systems and place strong upper limits on the energetic contribution of any heavily obscured AGN
  - We find no evidence for correlations between the line ratios and the AGN fraction derived from X-rays, indicating that HCN/HCO+ intensity ratios are not driven by the energetic dominance of AGN, nor are they reliable indicators of whether SMBH accretion is ongoing.

- [From Nuclear to Circumgalactic: Zooming in on AGN-Driven Outflows at z~2.2 with SINFONI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.02891)
  - SINFONI on the VLT to study the spatially resolved properties of ionized gas outflows driven by active galactic nuclei (AGN) in three galaxies at z~2.2 -- K20-ID5, COS4-11337 and J0901+1814.
  - The outflows do not appear to have any impact on the instantaneous star formation activity of the host galaxies, but they carry a significant amount of kinetic energy which could heat the halo gas and potentially lead to a reduction in the rate of cold gas accretion onto the galaxies.

- [Effects of Different Cosmic Ray Transport Models on Galaxy Formation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.02897)
  - 更物理的CR模型显示CR对星系演化的影响程度可能位于忽略CR的模拟以及简化模型带来的显著影响之间。
  - Cosmic rays (CRs) with ~GeV energies can contribute significantly to the energy and pressure budget in the interstellar, circumgalactic, and intergalactic medium (ISM, CGM, IGM).
  - Physical models of CR propagation/scattering via extrinsic turbulence and self-excited waves predict transport coefficients which are complicated functions of local plasma properties. we compare the effects of these models relative to simpler 'diffusion+streaming' models on galaxy and CGM properties at dwarf through MW mass scales.
  - The physical models predict large local variations in CR diffusivity, with median diffusivity increasing with galacto-centric radii and decreasing with galaxy mass and redshift. These effects lead to a more rapid dropoff of CR energy density in the CGM (compared to simpler models), in turn producing weaker effects of CRs on galaxy star formation rates (SFRs), CGM absorption profiles and galactic outflows

- [Discovery of a Thirty-Degree Long Ultraviolet Arc in Ursa Major](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.03175)
  - **Interesting**
  - We present the discovery of a thirty-degree long arc of ultraviolet emission with a thickness of only a few arcminutes: the Ursa Major Arc.
  - A two-degree section of the arc was first detected in the H{\alpha} optical spectral line in 1997; additional sections were seen in the optical by the team of amateur astronomers included in this work
  - Diffuse ultraviolet and optical interstellar emission are often attributed to scattering of light by interstellar dust. The lack of correlation between the Ursa Major Arc and thermal dust emission observed with the Planck satellite, however, suggests that other emission mechanisms must be at play.

- [Collimated synchrotron threads linking the radio lobes of ESO137-006](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.03203)
  - **Interesting**
  - Norma galaxy cluster中心星系的MeerKAT低频观测
  - The MeerKAT continuum images (rms ~0.02 mJy/beam at ~10" resolution) reveal new features that have never been seen in a radio galaxy before: collimated synchrotron threads of yet unknown origin
  - The radio spectrum of the threads is steep, with a spectral index of up to α≃2 between 1000 MHz and 1400 MHz.

### Apr 8

- [Below the subgrid: uncertainties in supernova input rates drive qualitative differences in simulations of galaxy evolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.03608)
  - We examine how simplifying assumptions made in approximating the SN rates along with underlying physical uncertainty in those rates can lead to large variations in the overall evolution of simulated Milky Way-like galaxies.
  - We find that the clustering of star formation is strongly impacted by the delay between star formation and SN feedback. SN time delay的选择影响也很大
  - In addition, we show that the uncertain minimum SN progenitor mass has a significant impact on the SN energy budget and injection timescale, and can completely change the overall evolution of the galaxy.

- [Modelling a bright z = 6 galaxy at the faint end of the AGN luminosity function](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.03611)
  - 高红移低光度AGN对再电离的影响： We use cosmological radiation-hydrodynamics simulations of a bright galaxy at z = 6 (M⋆≳10^10M⊙) hosting an actively growing super-massive black hole to study the properties of these objects.
  - 认为AGN feedback对星系性质影响不大，也不显著增加星系的电离能力；对再电离贡献不大
  - There is a transition in the galaxy population from star forming galaxies to quasar hosts, with bright Lyman-Break Galaxies (LBGs) with MUV around -22 falling in the overlap region

  - SKIRT建模；看恒星和尘埃的贡献；看年轻和老年星族对加热尘埃的贡献
  - 50%的尘埃加热来自<100 Myr年龄的年轻星族；老年星族贡献显著：In M 81, old stellar
populations are the dominant heating agent in the central regions and they contribute to half of the absorbed radiation

- [High-resolution, 3D radiative transfer modelling III. The DustPedia barred galaxies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.03616)
  - In this study, we analyse the contribution of the different stellar populations to the dust heating in four nearby face-on barred galaxies: NGC 1365, M 83, M 95, and M 100.
  - We derive global attenuation laws for each galaxy and confirm that galaxies of high specific star-formation rate have shallower attenuation curves and weaker UV bumps.
  - 这些星系里尘埃吸收了平均36%的热光度；棒对年轻星族加热尘埃的贡献有明显影响。年轻星族整体上对尘埃加热起到主导作用，但是在bar区域有所下降，在核球区域进一步降低；老年星族对核球区域的尘埃加热贡献更大
  - We also find a strong link between the heating fraction by the young stellar populations and the specific star-formation rate.

- [NIHAO-XXIII: Dark Matter density shaped by Black Hole feedback](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.03817)
  - We show that outflows generated by the AGN are able to partially counteract the dark matter contraction due to the large central stellar component in massive haloes
  - The net effect is to relax the central dark matter distribution that moves to a less cuspy density profiles at halo masses larger than ≈3×10^12 M⊙

- [Continuum polarization reverberation mapping of AGNs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.03957)

- [Cosmology with the Wide-Field Infrared Survey Telescope -- Synergies with the Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.04702)
  - **csst**
  - We consider a scenario where the currently envisioned survey strategy for WFIRST's High Latitude Survey (HLS), i.e., 2000 square degrees in four narrow photometric bands is altered in favor of a strategy that combines rapid coverage of the LSST area (to full LSST depth) in one band.
  - We explore a second, more ambitious scenario where WFIRST spends 1.5 years covering the LSST area.
  - Assuming the 5-month WFIRST wide scenario, we find a significant increase in constraining power for the joint LSST+WFIRST wide survey compared to LSST Y10 (FoM(Wwide)= 2.4 FoM(LSST)) and compared to LSST+WFIRST HLS (FoM(Wwide})= 5.5 FoM(HLS)).

- [Radio Power from a Direct-Collapse Black Hole in CR7](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.04167)
  - Here we estimate the radio flux from a DCBH and a young supernova remnant in CR7, the latter of which can be confused with flux from a quasar.
  - We find that a DCBH would emit a flux of 0.75 - 8.9 μJy at 1.0 GHz, far greater than the nJy signal expected for a young supernova, so the detection of any radio emission from CR7 would confirm it to be the potential site of a DCBH.

- [Etching glass in the early Universe: Luminous HF and water emission in a QSO-SMG pair at z=4.7](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.04176)
  - We present ALMA observations of hydrogen fluoride, HF J=1-0, H20 (202-211), and the 1.2 THz rest-frame continuum emission from the z=4.7 system BR1202-0725. BR1202-0725 is a galaxy group consisting of a QSO, a sub-millimeter galaxy (SMG), and two Ly-alpha emitters.
  - The QSO is the most luminous HF emitter yet found and has the same ratio of HF emission line to infrared luminosity as a sample of local AGN and the Orion Bar
  - The HF emission in the QSO is either excited by collisions with electrons and H2 in molecular plasmas irradiated by the AGN and intense star formation or predominately by collisions with H2, with a modest contribution from electrons
  - Although HF should be an excellent tracer of molecular outflows, we do not find strong evidence for outflows in HF in either the QSO or the SMG. From a putative absorption feature in HF in the SMG, we estimate an upper limit on the outflow rate
  - The lack of significant molecular outflows in either source may imply that much of the energy from the intense star formation and AGN activity in this pair is being dissipated in their ISM.

- [Strong chemical tagging with APOGEE: 21 candidate star clusters that have dissolved across the Milky Way disc](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.04263)
  - We apply a density-based clustering algorithm to the eight dimensional chemical space defined by [Mg/Fe], [Al/Fe], [Si/Fe], [K/Fe], [Ti/Fe], [Mn/Fe], [Fe/H], and [Ni/Fe]
  - We detect twenty-one candidate clusters with more than fifteen members.
  - Each group’s members are distributed over multiple kpc, and the spread in their radial and azimuthal actions increases with age

- [The Lyman Continuum Escape Fraction of Galaxies and AGN in the GOODS Fields](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.04360)
  - We present our analysis of the LyC emission and escape fraction of 111 spectroscopically verified galaxies with and without AGN from 2.26 < z < 4.3.
  - Among the 17 AGN from the 111 galaxies, one provided a LyC detection in F275W at mAB=23.19mag
  - We find the stack of 17 AGN dominate the LyC production from ⟨z⟩≃2.3−4.3 by a factor of ∼10 compared to all 94 galaxies without AGN.

- [Volumetric Star Formation Prescriptions in Vertically Resolved Edge-on Galaxies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.04363)
  - We find that the volumetric and surface SFLs in terms of the total gas have significantly different slopes, while the volumetric and surface SFLs in terms of the molecular gas do not show any noticeable difference.
  - We show that the interstellar gas pressure is strongly correlated with the SFR but find no significant difference between the correlations based on the volume and surface densities.

- [Evolution of the Thermodynamic Properties of Clusters of Galaxies out to Redshift of 1.8](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.04747)
  - **Interesting**
  - We find that thermodynamic properties in the outskirts of high redshift clusters are remarkably similar to the low redshift clusters, and their evolution follows the prediction of the self-similar model.
  - On the other hand, thermodynamic properties in the cluster cores deviates significantly from self-similarity indicating that the processes that regulate the core are already in place in these very high redshift clusters

- [2D-FFTLog: Efficient computation of real space covariance matrices for galaxy clustering and weak lensing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.04833)
  - Among various approaches to obtaining the covariance, analytic computation is much faster and less noisy than estimation from data or simulations. However, the transform of covariances from Fourier space to real space involves integrals with two Bessel integrals, which are numerically slow and easily affected by numerical uncertainties.
  - We introduce a 2D-FFTLog algorithm for efficient, accurate and numerically stable computation of non-Gaussian real space covariances.

- [Multi-phase outflows in post starburst E+A galaxies -- II. A direct connection between the neutral and ionized outflow phases](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.04749)
  - We present spatially-resolved IFU spectroscopy with MUSE/VLT of SDSS J124754.95-033738.6, a post starburst E+A galaxy with a recent starburst that started 70 Myrs ago and ended 30 Myrs ago, with a peak SFR of ∼150M⊙/yr
  - We detect disturbed gas throughout the entire field of view, suggesting triggering by a minor merger.
  - We detect fast-moving multi-phased gas clouds, embedded in a double-cone face-on outflow, which are traced by ionized emission lines and neutral NaID

- [GASP XXV: Neutral Hydrogen gas in the striking Jellyfish Galaxy JO204](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.04754)
  - The northern part of the galaxy disk has retained some HI gas, while the southern part has already been completely stripped and displaced into an extended unilateral tail.
  - We observe associated HI absorption against the 11 mJy central radio continuum source with an estimated HI absorption column density of 3.2 ×10^20 cm−2
  - The observed asymmetric absorption profile can therefore be explained by a clumpy, rotating HI gas disk seen partially in front of the central continuum source, or by ram-pressure pushing the neutral gas towards the center of the continuum source, triggering the AGN activity.

- [Direct Measurement of the HI-Halo Mass Relation through Stacking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.04762)
  - We find that the HI-halo mass relation is not a simple monotonic function, as assumed in several theoretical models. In addition to the dependence of halo mass, the total HI gas mass shows strong dependence on the halo richness, with larger HI masses in groups with more members at fixed halo masses
  - Moreover, halos with at least three member galaxies in the group catalog have a sharp decrease of the HI mass, potentially caused by the virial halo shock-heating and the AGN feedback.
  - HI气体主要来自质量<10^12.5 Msun halo的中心星系；<10^13 Msun halo里的HI主要靠并合增长

- [Liverpool-Maidanak monitoring of the Einstein Cross in 2006−2019. I. Light curves in the gVrRI optical bands and microlensing signatures](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.04991)
  - Through difference light curves, we found strong microlensing signatures. We then focused on the analytical modelling of two putative caustic-crossing events in image C, finding compelling evidence that this image experienced a double caustic crossing.
  - Our overall results indicate that a standard accretion disc accounts reasonably well for the brightness profile of UV continuum emission sources and for the growth in source radius when the emission wavelength increases

  - From a sample of 240 GRGs, we detected 37 sources in polarization, all with a total flux density above 56 mJy
  - Our analysis shows that the lobes are expanding into a low-density local environment permeated by weak magnetic fields (<0.1 µG) with fluctuations on scales of 3 to 25 kpc

- [Cosmology with the Wide-Field Infrared Survey Telescope -- Multi-Probe Strategies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.05271)
  - **CSST**
  - The 1.6 year HLS Reference survey is currently envisioned to image 2000 deg2 in multiple bands to a depth of ∼26.5 in Y, J, H and to cover the same area with slit-less spectroscopy beyond z=3.
  - We explore multi-probe strategies that can be implemented given WFIRST's instrument capabilities. We model cosmological probes individually and jointly and account for correlated systematics and statistical uncertainties due to the higher order moments of the density field

- [Noise from Undetected Sources in Dark Energy Survey Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.05618)
  - **Relevant, CSST**
  - Using injection of artifical galaxies into images, we demonstrate that the measured variance of galaxy moments (used for weak gravitational lensing measurements) in Dark Energy Survey (DES) images is significantly in excess of the Poisson predictions, by up to 30%, and that the background sky levels are overestimated by current software.
  - By cross-correlating distinct images of “empty” sky regions, we establish that there is a significant image noise contribution from undetected static sources (US),
  - We also find that local sky determinations can remove the bias in flux measurements, at a small penalty in additional, but quantifiable, noise.

- [The relation between galaxies and the warm-hot circumgalactic medium probed with X-ray and UV line absorption in the EAGLE simulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.05171)
  - Halo gas dominates the highest column density absorption for X-ray lines, but lower-density gas contributes to strong UV absorption lines from O VI and Ne VIII.
  - We predict that the Athena X-IFU will be able to observe O VII (O VIII) covering fractions within 100 pkpc of 77 (46) per cent around M⋆=10^10.5−11.0M⊙ galaxies
  - The circumgalactic medium (CGM) contains more metals than the interstellar medium across halo masses.

- [The Isaac Newton Telescope monitoring survey of Local Group dwarf galaxies. I. Survey overview and first results for Andromeda I](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.05620)
  - The main aims of this survey are to identify the most evolved asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars and red supergiants at the end-point of their evolution based on their pulsational instability
  - We detected 5581 stars and identified 59 LPV candidates within two half-light radii of the centre of And I. The amplitudes of these candidates range from 0.2 to 3 mag in the i-band. 75 % of detected sources and 98 % of LPV candidates are detected at mid-infrared wavelengths

- [Discovery of Radio Jets in Phoenix Galaxy Cluster Center](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.05724)
  - We spatially resolved radio emission around the BCG, and found diffuse bipolar and bar-shape structures extending from the active galactic nucleus (AGN) of the BCG.
  - If we assume that the radio jets/lobes expand with the sound velocity, their ages are estimated to be ~10 Myr.
  - We also found compact radio emissions near the center and suggest that they are another young bipolar jets with ~1 Myr of age.

- [Properties of environment around AGN and luminous galaxy pairs through HSC wide survey](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.05888)
  - The target AGNs were drawn from the Million Quasars (MILLIQUAS) catalog, and the blue galaxies were drawn from six redshift survey catalogs (SDSS, WiggleZ, DEEP2, VVDS, VIPERS, and PRIMUS).
  - We found that, among the five AGN and blue galaxy samples considered, the environment of AGN-LG pairs is the most enriched with luminous galaxies.
  - The results obtained in this study indicate that existence of multiple clusters is the major driver in the association of AGNs and LGs, rather than a single large-mass dark matter halo hosting the AGN.

- [A systematic study of galactic outflows via fluorescence emission: implications for their size and structure](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.06105)
  - We find that in the majority of cases the observed fluorescence emission lines are much weaker and narrower than the absorption lines, originating in the star-forming interstellar medium and/or the slowest-moving part of the inner outflow.
    - 大部分情况里outflow的荧光发射很弱，due to the missing emission arising on scales larger than those encompassed by the aperture of the HST
  - In a minority of cases, the outflowing absorbing material does make a significant contribution to the fluorescence emission. These latter systems are characterized by both strong Lyα emission lines and weak low-ionization absorption lines (both known to be empirical signs of Lyman-continuum leakage).

- [Improved constraints on reionisation from CMB observations: A parameterisation of the kSZ effect](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.06616)
  - In the context of patchy reionisation, an accurate description of the angular power spectrum of the kinetic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (kSZ) effect is not possible with simple scaling relations between the amplitude of the spectrum and global parameters such as the reionisation midpoint and its duration.
  - We introduce a new parameterisation of this spectrum, based on a novel description of the power spectrum of the free electrons density contrast Pee(k,z) in terms of reionisation global history and morphology.
  - We directly relate features of the spectrum to the typical ionised bubble size at different stages in the process, and subsequently to the angular scale at which the patchy kSZ power spectrum reaches its maximum.

  - we compare different approaches to estimate FIR line emission from state-of-the-art cosmological simulations, either with CLOUDY or with on-the-fly non-equilibrium chemistry. We find that
    - [CII]158μ predictions are robust.
    - [OI] emission lines are instead model-dependent, as these lines are strongly affected by the thermodynamic state of the gas and non-equilibrium photoionisation effects.

- [Galaxy pairs in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey -- XIV. Galaxy mergers do not lie on the Fundamental Metallicity Relation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.06121)
  - Despite the qualitative consistency with FMR expectations, the observed O/H dilution in galaxy pairs of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey is stronger than what is predicted by the FMR.
  - We find that galaxies in pairs are consistent with the FMR only when their separation is larger than 110 kpc.
  - We find that pairs are more sensitive to a second companion than to the local galaxy density, displaying less elevated SFRs with smaller values of r2.

- [Star formation traced by optical and millimeter hydrogen recombination lines and free-free emissions in the dusty merging galaxy NGC 3256 -- MUSE/VLT and ALMA synergy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.06123)
  - MUSE+ALMA观测： The Hβ image obtained by MUSE identifies star-forming regions outside the nuclear regions, suggesting a disk-wide starburst. In contrast, the H40α image obtained by ALMA identifies a nuclear starburst where optical lines are undetected due to dust extinction (AV∼25).
  - This suggests the dominance of disk-wide star formation in NGC~3256.

- [The detailed structure and the onset of galaxy formation in low-mass gaseous dark matter haloes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.06124)
  - In this model, galaxy formation can only take place in dark matter haloes whose mass exceeds a redshift-dependent critical value, which, before reionization, is equal (in the simplest case) to the mass at which atomic hydrogen cooling becomes effective and, after reionization, is equal to the mass above which gas cannot remain in hydrostatic equilibrium
  - 预测固定Halo质量上多少比例的halo里面有星系：预测现在5x10^9 Msun以上的halo里100%有星系；3x10^8 Msun一下的halo里星系比例就显著下降了

  - We investigate the recovery of high-redshift 5< z <12 galaxies through extensive image simulations of accepted JWST programs such as CEERS
  - We find that the photometric redshifts are primarily limited by the availability of blue-band and near-infrared medium-band imaging.
  - The faint-end slope of the galaxy UV luminosity function is recovered with a precision of 0.1−0.25, and the cosmic star-formation rate density within 0.1 dex.

- [Ejective and preventative: the IllustrisTNG black hole feedback and its effects on the thermodynamics of the gas within and around galaxies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.06132)
  - We find that gas entropy is a sensitive diagnostic of feedback injection. In particular, we demonstrate how the onset of the low-accretion BH feedback mode, realised in the IllustrisTNG model as a kinetic, BH-driven wind, leads not only to star-formation quenching at stellar masses ≳10^10.5M⊙ but also to a change in thermodynamic properties of the (non-star-forming) gas, both within the galaxy and beyond.
  - The same AGN feedback channel is simultaneously "ejective" and "preventative" and leaves an imprint on the temperature, density, entropy, and cooling times also in the outer reaches of the gas halo

- [Fundamental relations for the velocity dispersion of stars in the Milky Way](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.06556)
  - In addition to the well-known dependence on stellar age, the velocity dispersions of stars depend on orbital angular momentum Lz, metallicity and height above the plane |z|, and are well described by a multiplicatively separable functional form.
  - Even though they target different tracer populations and employ a variety of age estimation techniques, follow the same set of fundamental relations.
  - The dispersions increase with decreasing metallicity, suggesting that the dispersions increase with birth radius. The dispersions also increase linearly with |z|.

- [Minimum size of cosmological 21-cm simulations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.06709)
  - The first galaxies are likely very rare and biased, with their abundances modulated by long wavelength modes of the density field. Moreover, the radiation fields from these galaxies interact with the IGM over a large range of scales. Therefore, the limited volume of 21-cm simulations can underestimate the amount of structure in the signal.
  - We find that simulations of box lengths 200-300 Mpc typically do not show a bias in the PS during the EoR; however, they do tend to underestimate the large-scale power during the earlier epoch of CD by ~7-9 % on average.
  - We conclude that box lengths of 250 Mpc are needed to converge at the level of <~1 sigma of the total noise.

  - A tilted CMZ might provide an alternative explanation to the ∞-shaped structuere identified in Herschel data
  - The bar in our simulation efficiently drives an inflow from the Galactic disc (R≃3 kpc) down to the CMZ: 1 Msun/yr
  - Self-gravity and supernovae feedback can drive an inflow from the CMZ inwards towards the circumnuclear disc: 0.03 Msun/yr

- [Simulations of the Milky Way's central molecular zone -- II. Star formation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.06731)

  - We observed 1.4 GHz continuum and HI emission with the Very Large Array in its B-configuration in two fields of the Coma cluster to study the radio properties of RPS galaxies.
  - Radio continuum tails are found in 10 (8 are new) out of 20 RPS galaxies, unambiguously revealing the presence of relativistic electrons and magnetic fields in the stripped tails.
  - The 1.4 GHz continuum in the tails is enhanced relative to their Hα emission by a factor of ∼7 compared to the main bodies of the RPS galaxies. The 1.4 GHz continuum of the RPS galaxies is enhanced relative to their IR emission by a factor of ∼2 compared to star-forming galaxies.
  - No evidence of radio emission associated with ultra-diffuse galaxies is found in our data.

  - We report H I absorption detection towards seven radio AGNs, six of which are new.
  - Compact radio AGNs with WISE colour W2−W3 >2 have higher detection rates compared to those with W2−W3 <2.
  - We find that while LERGs show a wide range in the shift of centroid velocities (∼ −479 to +356 km s−1) relative to the optical systemic velocity, most of the HERGs have centroid velocity shift less than 200 km s−1, possibly due to differences in jet-interstellar medium interaction.

- [Detection of the Schwarzschild precession in the orbit of the star S2 near the Galactic centre massive black hole](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.07187)
  - **Interesting**
  - We report the first detection of the General Relativity (GR) Schwarzschild Precession (SP) in S2's orbit.
  - Owing to its highly elliptical orbit (e = 0.88), S2's SP is mainly a kink between the pre-and post-pericentre directions of motion ~ +- 1 year around pericentre passage, relative to the corresponding Kepler orbit.
  - The S2 data are fully consistent with GR. Any extended mass inside S2's orbit cannot exceed ~ 0.1% of the central mass. Any compact third mass inside the central arcsecond must be less than about 1000 M_sun.
