- [Weak lensing clusters from HSC survey first-year data: Mitigating the dilution effect of foreground and cluster member galaxies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.00170)
  - We adopt the globally normalized weak lensing estimator which is least affected by cluster member galaxies, and we select source galaxies by using photometric redshift information to mitigate the effect of foreground galaxies
  - We find that 107 out of 124 peaks have matched clusters within 5 arcmin from peak positions. Among them, we define a sub-sample of 64 secure clusters that we use to examine dilution effects on our weak lensing peak finding

- [Effect of Active Galactic Nuclei Thermal Heating with Radial Dependence on Thermal Stability of Simulated Galaxy Clusters](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.00021)
  - ENZO模拟校验：Previous analytical work has suggested specific configurations of heating kernels that may result in thermal balance and a steady state.
  - Some heating kernels produced thermally steady galaxy clusters, no kernel was able to produce a steady cluster with a central entropy as low as the central entropies typically observed among CC
  - The simulated clusters enter an unsteady multiphase state on a timescale proportional to the square of the cooling time of the lowest entropy gas in the simulation, with centrally concentrated heating resulting in a steady state lasting for a longer period of time.

- [Why do extremely massive disc galaxies exist today?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.00023)
  - **Relevant**
  - Horizon-AGN里面产生>10^11.4的Disc星系的两个渠道
  - primary channel (accounting for ~70% of these systems and ~8% of massive galaxies) the most recent, significant merger (stellar mass ratio > 1:10) between a massive spheroid and a gas-rich satellite `spins up' the spheroid by creating a new rotational stellar component
  - Secondary channel (accounting for ~30% of these systems and ~3% of massive galaxies), a system maintains a disc throughout its lifetime, due to an anomalously quiet merger history.

- [Clustering of Local Group distances: publication bias or correlated measurements? VII. A distance framework out to 100 Mpc](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.00114)
  - We recommend `best' weighted relative distance moduli for the Fornax and Coma clusters with respect to the Virgo cluster of Δ(m−M)Fornax−Virgo0=0.18±0.28 mag and Δ(m−M)Coma−Virgo0=3.75±0.23 mag.
  - The absolute and relative distance moduli for both clusters are mutually consistent within the uncertainties; the relative distance moduli yield shorter distances by ∼1σ. Lingering uncertainties in the underlying absolute distance scale appear to have given rise to a systematic uncertainty on the order of 0.20 mag.

- [Outside the Lyman-break box: detecting Lyman continuum emitters at 3.5<z<5.1 with CLAUDS](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.00158)
  - We present a sample of Lyman continuum galaxy (LCG) candidates in the redshift range 3.5≲z≲5.1.
  - 基于BPASS模拟估计：escapte fraction在30-90%之间
  - Stacking candidates without solid LyC detections (S/N<3) results in an estimated fabsesc from galaxies not greater than 1%.

- [A radiative transfer model for the spiral galaxy M33](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.00400)
  - We used the axi-symmetric RT model of Popescu et al. and a new methodology for deriving geometrical parameters, and applied this to decode the{spectral energy distribution (SED) of M33.
  - We predict well the energy balance between absorption and re-emission by dust, with no need to invoke modified grain properties, and we find no submm emission that is in excess of our model predictions.
  - We identify several morphological components in M33, a nuclear, an inner, a main and an outer disc, showing a monotonic trend in decreasing star-formation surface-density

### Apr 2

- [A Triple Rollover: A third multiply-imaged source at z~6 behind the Jackpot gravitational lens](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.00649)
  - MUSE观测：we have identified a doubly-imaged Ly α source at redshift 5.975 behind the z = 0.222 lens galaxy J0946+1006
  - 这个系统里之前已经有两个lens-source pair，这是唯一一个triple system
  - The third source also probes two new distance scaling factors which are sensitive to the cosmological parameters of the Universe.

- [Tight Constraints on the Excess Radio Background at z=9.1 from LOFAR](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.00678)
  - We use the upper limit on the 21-cm signal from the Epoch of Reionization (z = 9.1) based on 141 hours of observations with LOFAR (Mertens et al. 2020) to evaluate the contribution of the high redshift Universe to the detected radio background
  - Even though LOFAR places limit on the extra radio background, excess of 0.1 − 0.7% over the CMB (at 1.42 GHz) is still allowed and could explain the EDGES Low-Band detection

- [The Atacama Cosmology Telescope: A CMB lensing mass map over 2100 square degrees of sky and its cross-correlation with BOSS-CMASS galaxies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.01139)
  - These maps cover 2100 square degrees of sky and overlap with a wide variety of optical surveys
  -  We also create lensing maps with thermal Sunyaev-Zel’dovich contamination removed using a novel cleaning procedure that only slightly degrades the lensing signal-to-noise ratio.
  - The cross-spectrum between the cleaned lensing map and the BOSS CMASS galaxy sample is detected at 10-σ significance, with an amplitude of A = 1.02±0.10 relative to the Planck best-fit LCDM cosmological model with fiducial linear galaxy bias.

- [Survey of Gravitationally-lensed Objects in HSC Imaging (SuGOHI). VI. Crowdsourced lens finding with Space Warps](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.00634)
  - We selected a sample of ∼300,000 galaxies with photometric redshifts in the range 0.2 < zphot < 1.2 and photometrically inferred stellar masses logM∗>11.2.
  - In parallel, we used YattaLens, an automated lens finding algorithm, to look for lenses in the same sample of galaxies.
  - We were able to find 14 definite lenses, 129 probable lenses and 581 possible lenses

- [Mergers Do Trigger AGNs out to z ∼ 0.6](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.00680)
  - 在GAMA里面用CNN找merger：We find that AGNs are more likely to be found in mergers than non-mergers, with an AGN excess up to 1.81±0.16, suggesting that mergers can trigger AGNs.
  - The fraction of mergers in AGNs is higher than that in non-AGN controls, for both MIR and optically selected AGNs, as well as LERGs
  - This merger fraction in AGNs increases as stellar mass increases which supports the idea that mergers are more important for triggering AGNs in more massive galaxies.

- [Quantifying the effect of field variance on the Hα luminosity function with the New Numerical Galaxy Catalogue](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.00815)
  - We construct a model of Hα emitters (HAEs) based on a semi-analytic galaxy formation model, the New Numerical Galaxy Catalog
  - We have confirmed that the HAE is a useful tracer for the large-scale structure of the Universe because of their significant overdensity (> 5σ) at clusters and the filamentary structures.
  - The Hα LFs within a survey area of ∼2 deg2 (typical for previous observational studies) show a significant field variance up to ∼1 dex. Based on our model

- [The effect of hydrodynamics alone on the subhalo population in a ΛCDM rich cluster sized dark matter halo](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.00836)
  - We perform a set of non-radiative hydro-dynamical (NHD) simulations of a rich cluster sized dark matter halo...Compared to dark matter only (DMO) simulations of the same halo, subhaloes are less abundant for relatively massive subhaloes, but more abundant for less massive subhaloes.
  - This is mainly because the progenitors of present day low mass subhaloes have larger concentration parameters in the NHD than DMO simulations.
  - The survival number fraction of the accreted low mass progenitors of the main halo at redshift 2 is about 50 percent higher in the NHD than DMO simulations.

- [FLASH Early Science -- Discovery of an intervening HI 21-cm absorber from an ASKAP survey of the GAMA 23 field](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.00847)
  - ASKAP: First Large Absorption Survey in HI (FLASH), a spectroscopically blind survey for 21-cm absorption lines in cold hydrogen HI gas at cosmological distances
  - We have searched for HI absorption towards 1253 radio sources in the GAMA 23 field, covering redshifts between z=0.34 and 0.79 over a sky area of approximately 50 square degrees.
  - Blind巡天中没有找到吸收体：We estimate upper limits on the HI column density frequency distribution function that are consistent with measurements from prior surveys for redshifted optical DLAs
  - 在一个z=0.36的早型星系周围17kpc处找到了3x10^9 Msun的吸收体: Such gas-rich early types are rare, but have been detected in the nearby Universe.

### Apr 5

- [A tomographic map of the large-scale matter distribution using the eBOSS Stripe 82 Ly-α forest](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.01448)
  - We investigate the Ly-α forest available in the Stripe 82 field (220deg2), based on the quasar spectra from SDSS Data Release DR16. The density of observed quasar spectra is 37deg−2
  - 比CLAMATO的体积大得多：We derive a 3D map of large-scale matter fluctuations from these data, using a Wiener filter technique.
  - A stack over quasar positions provides a visualization of the Ly-α quasar cross-correlation.

- [The fate of disk galaxies in IllustrisTNG clusters](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.01191)
  - **Relevant**
  - The galaxies' histories are traced from the time of accretion to z=0 and compared to a control sample of central galaxies mass-matched at the time of accretion.
  - Most cluster disks become non-disky by z=0, in stark contrast with the control disks, of which a significant fraction remains disky over the same timescales. 同时伴随着气体移除和SF停滞
  - Cluster disks that become non-disky by z=0 have lost dark matter (DM) mass and show little growth or a loss of stellar mass, whereas the corresponding control disks show significant growth in both components.
  - For cluster disks, the perturbation is in the form of impulsive tidal shocking at pericentres and not tidal stripping of the outer disk stellar material, whereas for control disks, a combination of mergers and AGN feedback appears to be the key driving force behind morphological transformations.

- [Fundamental differences in the radio properties of red and blue quasars: Insight from the LOFAR Two-metre Sky Survey (LoTSS)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.01196)
  - Red quasars: a significant (factor ∼3) enhancement in the radio-detection fraction
  - Compared to a control sample of normal "blue" QSOs matched in redshift and accretion power, red QSOs have a higher radio detection rate and a higher incidence of compact radio morphologies.
  - We also demonstrate that these differences arise primarily in sources of intermediate radio-loudness: radio-intermediate red QSOs are ×3 more common than typical QSOs, but the excess diminishes among the most radio-loud and the most radio-quiet systems in our study.

- [Fundamental differences in the radio properties of red and blue quasars: enhanced compact AGN emission in red quasars](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.01197)
  - 用更深的VLA-S82数据：we perform morphological analyses at a resolution and depth three times that of the FIRST radio survey, and confirm an enhancement in radio-faint and compact red quasars over typical quasars
  - Find tentative evidence for an enhancement in red quasars with slightly extended radio structures
  - From our data we find that the radio enhancement from red quasars is due to AGN activity on compact scales (<43 kpc) for radio-intermediate-radio-quiet sources

- [Infrared Colours and Spectral Energy Distributions of Hard X-ray Selected Obscured and Compton-thick AGN](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.01273)
  - 探索挑选CT-AGN的新方式：We present a new infrared selection for Compton-thick AGN based on MIR and FIR colours ([9μm - 22μm]>3.0 and [22μm - 90μm]<2.7) from WISE and AKARI.
  - Conclude that MIR colours covering 9.7μm silicate absorption and MIR continuum can be a promising new tool to identify Compton-thick AGN.
  - We show that the average covering factor of Compton-thick AGN is higher compared to the obscured and unobscured AGN.

- [A flare in the optical spotted in the changing-look Seyfert NGC 3516](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.01308)
  - During the flare, we observe stronger forbidden high-ionization iron lines than reported before, as well as the complex broad H{\alpha} and H{\beta} lines. This is especially seen in H{\alpha} that appears to be double-peaked. It seems that a very broad component of ~10000 km/s width in the Balmer lines is appearing.
  - The increase of the continuum emission, the variability of the coronal lines, and the very broad component in the Balmer lines may indicate that AGN of NGC 3516 is finally leaving the low-activity state in which it has been in the last ~3 years.

- [The Nature of Ultra-diffuse Galaxies in Distant Massive Galaxy Clusters: Abell 370 in the Hubble Frontier Fields](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.01340)
  - **Relevant**
  - We find 46 UDGs in Abell 370 from the images of the Hubble Frontier Fields (HFF). 大部分都是red的
  - We estimate the abundance of UDGs in Abell 370, N(UDG)=644±104.
  - The number density profiles of UDGs and bright galaxies show a discrepancy in the central region of the clusters: the profile of UDGs shows a flattening as clustercentric distance decreases, while that of bright galaxies shows a continuous increase.
  - This implies that most UDGs have a dwarf-like origin and a small number of them could be failed L∗ galaxies.

- [A Tidal Disruption Event Candidate Discovered in the Active Galactic Nucleus SDSS J022700.77-042020.6](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.01517)
  - A sudden increase in flux of J0227-0420 during the second half of 2009 is clearly shown in the long-term optical, UV, and NIR light curves. A plateau phase, following an initial decline, is seen in the NUV and optical u, g, r, i light curves.
  - We find possible evidence that the plateau phase in the NUV band may lag behind the optical ones by approximately 70-80 days with also a much shorter duration
  - The plateaus can be explained if the stellar streams collide with the pre-existing AGN disk at different radii. Though the overall fallback rate decreases, the material in the outer disk gradually drifts inward and increases the local accretion rate at the inner region, producing the optical and UV plateaus.
  - The possible lag between the optical and NUV plateaus can then be attributed to viscosity delay.

- [Molecular Gas Heating and Modified Dust Properties in Active Galaxies: Growing Black Holes or Tidal Shocks?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.01695)
  - We use MIR spectroscopic measurements of emission from rotational H2 transitions, dust and PAH features, and silicate emission or absorption lines at 9.7 microns to study how gravitational interactions impact the warm ISM in AGN and non-AGN hosts.
  - We find that in AGN-hosts, the ISM is warmer, the ratios of H2 to PAHs are larger, the PAH emission line ratios and silicate strengths have a wider range of values than in non-AGN hosts.

### Apr 6

- [Free-form Grale lens inversion of galaxy clusters with up to 1000 multiple images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.01724)
  - We scrutinize the performance of the free-form lens inversion method Grale in the regime of 150−1000 input images, using synthetic massive galaxy clusters.
  - While the fidelity of the reconstruction improves with the increasing number of multiple images used as model constraints, ∼150 to ∼1000, the lens plane rms deteriorates from ∼0.11″ to ∼0.28″. Since lens plane rms is not necessarily the best indicator of the quality of the mass reconstructions, looking for an alternative indicator is warranted.

- [The Effect of Massive Neutrinos on the Galaxy Spin Flip Phenomenon](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.02638)
  - The galaxy spin flip refers to the phenomenon that the spin axes of galaxies with masses above a certain threshold tend to be preferentially aligned perpendicular to the hosting large-scale filaments, while low mass or early type galaxies tend to have their spin axes aligned parallel to such structures.
  - We present, for the first time, a numerical examination of this phenomenon assuming the presence of massive neutrinos, finding a clear and robust dependence of the threshold mass for the spin flip on the total neutrino mass.
  - Our physical explanation is that the presence of more massive neutrinos retard the nonlinear evolution of the cosmic web, which in turn allows the galaxy spin vectors to better retain their memories of the initial tidal interactions even in the highly nonlinear regime.

- [Optical and X-ray discovery of the changing-look AGN IRAS23226-3843 showing extremely broad and double-peaked Balmer profiles](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.01711)
  - We detected a very strong X-ray decline in the galaxy IRAS23226-3843 within the XMM-Newton slew survey in 2017
  - IRAS23226-3843 decreased in X-rays by a factor of more than 30 with respect to ROSAT and Swift data taken 10 to 27 years before.
  - The optical continuum decreased by 60 percent and the Balmer line intensities decreased by 50 percent between 1999 and 2017. The optical Seyfert spectral type changed simultaneously with the X-ray flux from a clear broad-line Seyfert 1 type in 1999 to a Seyfert 1.9 type in 2017
  - The unusual flat Balmer decrement Ha/Hb with a value of 2 indicates a very high hydrogen density of n_(H) > 10 exp(11) cm^(-3) at the center of the accretion disk. IRAS23226-3843 shows unusually strong FeII blends with respect to the broad line widths, in contrast to what is known from Eigenvector 1 studies.

- [Atacama Compact Array Measurements of the Molecular Mass in the NGC 5044 Cooling Flow Group](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.01717)
  - **Relevant**
  - NGC5044,一个X-ray bright group的中心星系：using the 7m array data, that we can recover the total flux inferred from IRAM 30m single dish observations, which corresponds to a total molecular mass of about 4x10^7 Msun.
  - We find 8 concentrations of molecular gas out to a radius of 10 arcsec (1.5 kpc), which we identify with giant molecular clouds.
  - We find two CO absorption features spatially located at the center of the galaxy, within 5 pc projected distance of the AGN, infalling at 255 and 265 km/s relative to the AGN. This indicates that the two giant molecular clouds seen in absorption are most likely within the sphere of influence of the supermassive black hole.

- [A joint SZ-Xray-optical analysis of the dynamical state of 288 massive galaxy clusters](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.01721)
  - **Relevant**
  - We examine spatial offsets between the position of the brightest cluster galaxy (BCG) and the center of the gas distribution as traced by the SPT-SZ centroid and by the X-ray centroid/peak position from Chandra and XMM data. We show that the radial distribution of offsets provides no evidence that SPT SZ-selected cluster samples include a higher fraction of mergers than X-ray-selected cluster samples.
  - We find that Schechter function fits to the galaxy population in disturbed clusters and relaxed clusters differ at z>0.55 but not at lower redshifts.
  - Within the same redshift range, we find that the BCGs in relaxed clusters tend to be brighter than the BCGs in disturbed samples, while in agreement in the lower redshift bin.

- [Molecular gas in CLASH brightest cluster galaxies at z∼0.2−0.9](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.01786)
  - **Relevant**
  - We have observed in CO(1-0), CO(2-1), CO(3-2), or CO(4-3), with the IRAM-30m, 18 BCGs at z∼0.2−0.9 that are drawn from the CLASH survey.
  - 在恒星形成率最高的RX1532中探测到了大量分子气体；We tentatively detected CO(1-0) or CO(2-1) in four other BCGs；For the remaining 13 BCGs we set robust upper limits of MH2/M⋆≲0.1,
  - By comparison with distant cluster galaxies observed in CO our study shows that RX1532 (MH2/M⋆=0.40±0.05) belongs to the rare population of star forming and gas-rich BCGs in the distant universe.

- [The ARTEMIS simulations: stellar haloes of Milky Way-mass galaxies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.01914)
  - **Relevant**
  - A new set of 42 zoomed-in, high-resolution (baryon particle mass of ~ 2x10^4 Msun/h)
  - The stellar density profiles are well fitted by broken power laws, with inner slopes of ~ -3, outer slopes of ~ -4 and break radii that are typically ~ 20-40 kpc. The break radii generally mark the transition between in situ formation and accretion-driven formation of the halo.
  - Overall, the structural properties can be understood by two factors: that in situ stars dominate the inner regions and that they reside in a spatially-flattened distribution that is aligned with the disc. Observations targeting both the major and minor axes of galaxies are thus required to obtain a complete picture of stellar haloes.

- [Luminosity-duration relations and luminosity functions of repeating and non-repeating fast radio bursts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.02079)
  - **Interesting**
  - Here we show the time-integrated luminosity-duration (Lν-wint,rest) relations and luminosity functions (LFs) of repeating and non-repeating FRBs in the FRB Catalogue project. 两类FRB明显不一样。
  - Repeating FRBs have relatively fainter Lν and longer wint,rest with a much lower LF.
  - Repeating FRBs do not show any clear correlation between Lν and wint,rest，而非再现FRB则有此相关
  - The faint ends of the LFs of repeating and non-repeating FRBs are higher than volumetric occurrence rates of neutron-star mergers and accretion-induced collapse (AIC) of white dwarfs, and are consistent with those of soft gamma-ray repeaters (SGRs), type Ia supernovae, magnetars, and white-dwarf mergers.
  - The bright ends of LFs of repeating and non-repeating FRBs are lower than any candidates of progenitors, suggesting that bright FRBs are produced from a very small fraction of the progenitors regardless of the repetition. Otherwise, they might originate in unknown progenitors.

- [Star Formation Enhancement in Barred Disk Galaxies in Interacting Galaxy Clusters](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.02204)
  - We find that fsf is moderately higher (∼20%) in interacting clusters than in non-interacting clusters and that the enhancement of star formation in interacting clusters occurs only in moderate-mass disk-dominated galaxies.
  - We also find that the enhancement of fsf in moderate-mass disk-dominated galaxies in interacting clusters is mostly due to the increase of the number of barred galaxies. Our result suggests that the cluster-cluster interaction can simultaneously induce bars and star formation in disk galaxies.

- [Ultradense Gases beyond Dusty Torus in a Partially Obscured Quasar](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.02436)
  - Here we report the detection of clear and rich emission lines origin from the scale of dusty tours in an partially obscured quasar
  - We interpret this as the lines being excited by a shock induced by the high-density and high-temperature gases at the scale of dusty torus, rather than photo-ionized by the central accretion disk.

- [Infrared luminosity functions and dust mass functions in the EAGLE simulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.02713)
  - 利用SKIRT看EAGLE中的dust mass function和IRLF；in the high luminosity regime, where the EAGLE-SKIRT luminosity functions mildly but systematically underestimate the observed ones.
  - The agreement between the EAGLE-SKIRT infrared luminosity functions and the observed ones gradually worsens with increasing lookback time.
  - The mild evolution of the dust mass density is in relatively good agreement with observations, but the slow evolution of the infrared luminosity underestimates the observed luminosity evolution significantly.

- [New high-quality strong lens candidates with deep learning in the Kilo Degree Survey](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.02715)
  - We have developed a new Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) classifier to search for gravitational arcs, following the prescription by Petrillo et al. 2019 and using only r−band images
  - We have found 286 new high probability candidates, 133 from the LRG sample and 153 from the BG sample.

### Apr 7

- [Probing cosmic isotropy with a new X-ray galaxy cluster sample through the LX−T scaling relation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.03305)
  - **Interesting, Important**
  - We used 313 homogeneously selected X-ray galaxy clusters from the Meta-Catalogue of X-ray detected Clusters of galaxies (MCXC).
  - The behavior of the LX − T relation heavily depends on the direction of the sky, which is consistent with previous studies. Strong anisotropies are detected at a & 4σ confidence level toward the Galactic coordinates (l, b) ∼ (280◦, −20◦),
  - 可能的systematic解释：, the X-ray absorption treatment, the effect of galaxy groups and low redshift clusters, core metallicities, and apparent correlations with other cluster properties, but none is able to explain the obtained results.
  - The maximum variation of DL seems to be ∼ 16 ± 3% for different regions in the sky. This result demonstrates that X-ray studies that assume perfect isotropy in the properties of galaxy clusters and their scaling relations can produce strongly biased results whether the underlying reason is cosmological or related to X-rays.

- [A Hard X-ray Test of HCN Enhancements as a Tracer of Embedded Black Hole Growth](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.02884)
  - HCN/HCO+比例可否作为AGN判据：we identified galaxies with HCN/HCO+ (1-0) intensity ratios consistent with those of many AGN but whose mid-infrared spectral diagnostics are consistent with little to no ( ≲15%) contribution of an AGN to the bolometric luminosity.
  - We find no X-ray evidence for AGN in three of the systems and place strong upper limits on the energetic contribution of any heavily obscured AGN
  - We find no evidence for correlations between the line ratios and the AGN fraction derived from X-rays, indicating that HCN/HCO+ intensity ratios are not driven by the energetic dominance of AGN, nor are they reliable indicators of whether SMBH accretion is ongoing.

- [From Nuclear to Circumgalactic: Zooming in on AGN-Driven Outflows at z~2.2 with SINFONI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.02891)
  - SINFONI on the VLT to study the spatially resolved properties of ionized gas outflows driven by active galactic nuclei (AGN) in three galaxies at z~2.2 -- K20-ID5, COS4-11337 and J0901+1814.
  - The outflows do not appear to have any impact on the instantaneous star formation activity of the host galaxies, but they carry a significant amount of kinetic energy which could heat the halo gas and potentially lead to a reduction in the rate of cold gas accretion onto the galaxies.

- [Effects of Different Cosmic Ray Transport Models on Galaxy Formation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.02897)
  - 更物理的CR模型显示CR对星系演化的影响程度可能位于忽略CR的模拟以及简化模型带来的显著影响之间。
  - Cosmic rays (CRs) with ~GeV energies can contribute significantly to the energy and pressure budget in the interstellar, circumgalactic, and intergalactic medium (ISM, CGM, IGM).
  - Physical models of CR propagation/scattering via extrinsic turbulence and self-excited waves predict transport coefficients which are complicated functions of local plasma properties. we compare the effects of these models relative to simpler 'diffusion+streaming' models on galaxy and CGM properties at dwarf through MW mass scales.
  - The physical models predict large local variations in CR diffusivity, with median diffusivity increasing with galacto-centric radii and decreasing with galaxy mass and redshift. These effects lead to a more rapid dropoff of CR energy density in the CGM (compared to simpler models), in turn producing weaker effects of CRs on galaxy star formation rates (SFRs), CGM absorption profiles and galactic outflows

- [Discovery of a Thirty-Degree Long Ultraviolet Arc in Ursa Major](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.03175)
  - **Interesting**
  - We present the discovery of a thirty-degree long arc of ultraviolet emission with a thickness of only a few arcminutes: the Ursa Major Arc.
  - A two-degree section of the arc was first detected in the H{\alpha} optical spectral line in 1997; additional sections were seen in the optical by the team of amateur astronomers included in this work
  - Diffuse ultraviolet and optical interstellar emission are often attributed to scattering of light by interstellar dust. The lack of correlation between the Ursa Major Arc and thermal dust emission observed with the Planck satellite, however, suggests that other emission mechanisms must be at play.

- [Collimated synchrotron threads linking the radio lobes of ESO137-006](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.03203)
  - **Interesting**
  - Norma galaxy cluster中心星系的MeerKAT低频观测
  - The MeerKAT continuum images (rms ~0.02 mJy/beam at ~10" resolution) reveal new features that have never been seen in a radio galaxy before: collimated synchrotron threads of yet unknown origin
  - The radio spectrum of the threads is steep, with a spectral index of up to α≃2 between 1000 MHz and 1400 MHz.

### Apr 8

- [Below the subgrid: uncertainties in supernova input rates drive qualitative differences in simulations of galaxy evolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.03608)
  - We examine how simplifying assumptions made in approximating the SN rates along with underlying physical uncertainty in those rates can lead to large variations in the overall evolution of simulated Milky Way-like galaxies.
  - We find that the clustering of star formation is strongly impacted by the delay between star formation and SN feedback. SN time delay的选择影响也很大
  - In addition, we show that the uncertain minimum SN progenitor mass has a significant impact on the SN energy budget and injection timescale, and can completely change the overall evolution of the galaxy.

- [Modelling a bright z = 6 galaxy at the faint end of the AGN luminosity function](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.03611)
  - 高红移低光度AGN对再电离的影响： We use cosmological radiation-hydrodynamics simulations of a bright galaxy at z = 6 (M⋆≳10^10M⊙) hosting an actively growing super-massive black hole to study the properties of these objects.
  - 认为AGN feedback对星系性质影响不大，也不显著增加星系的电离能力；对再电离贡献不大
  - There is a transition in the galaxy population from star forming galaxies to quasar hosts, with bright Lyman-Break Galaxies (LBGs) with MUV around -22 falling in the overlap region

  - SKIRT建模；看恒星和尘埃的贡献；看年轻和老年星族对加热尘埃的贡献
  - 50%的尘埃加热来自<100 Myr年龄的年轻星族；老年星族贡献显著：In M 81, old stellar
populations are the dominant heating agent in the central regions and they contribute to half of the absorbed radiation

- [High-resolution, 3D radiative transfer modelling III. The DustPedia barred galaxies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.03616)
  - In this study, we analyse the contribution of the different stellar populations to the dust heating in four nearby face-on barred galaxies: NGC 1365, M 83, M 95, and M 100.
  - We derive global attenuation laws for each galaxy and confirm that galaxies of high specific star-formation rate have shallower attenuation curves and weaker UV bumps.
  - 这些星系里尘埃吸收了平均36%的热光度；棒对年轻星族加热尘埃的贡献有明显影响。年轻星族整体上对尘埃加热起到主导作用，但是在bar区域有所下降，在核球区域进一步降低；老年星族对核球区域的尘埃加热贡献更大
  - We also find a strong link between the heating fraction by the young stellar populations and the specific star-formation rate.

- [NIHAO-XXIII: Dark Matter density shaped by Black Hole feedback](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.03817)
  - We show that outflows generated by the AGN are able to partially counteract the dark matter contraction due to the large central stellar component in massive haloes
  - The net effect is to relax the central dark matter distribution that moves to a less cuspy density profiles at halo masses larger than ≈3×10^12 M⊙

- [Continuum polarization reverberation mapping of AGNs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.03957)

- [Cosmology with the Wide-Field Infrared Survey Telescope -- Synergies with the Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.04702)
  - **csst**
  - We consider a scenario where the currently envisioned survey strategy for WFIRST's High Latitude Survey (HLS), i.e., 2000 square degrees in four narrow photometric bands is altered in favor of a strategy that combines rapid coverage of the LSST area (to full LSST depth) in one band.
  - We explore a second, more ambitious scenario where WFIRST spends 1.5 years covering the LSST area.
  - Assuming the 5-month WFIRST wide scenario, we find a significant increase in constraining power for the joint LSST+WFIRST wide survey compared to LSST Y10 (FoM(Wwide)= 2.4 FoM(LSST)) and compared to LSST+WFIRST HLS (FoM(Wwide})= 5.5 FoM(HLS)).

- [Radio Power from a Direct-Collapse Black Hole in CR7](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.04167)
  - Here we estimate the radio flux from a DCBH and a young supernova remnant in CR7, the latter of which can be confused with flux from a quasar.
  - We find that a DCBH would emit a flux of 0.75 - 8.9 μJy at 1.0 GHz, far greater than the nJy signal expected for a young supernova, so the detection of any radio emission from CR7 would confirm it to be the potential site of a DCBH.

- [Etching glass in the early Universe: Luminous HF and water emission in a QSO-SMG pair at z=4.7](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.04176)
  - We present ALMA observations of hydrogen fluoride, HF J=1-0, H20 (202-211), and the 1.2 THz rest-frame continuum emission from the z=4.7 system BR1202-0725. BR1202-0725 is a galaxy group consisting of a QSO, a sub-millimeter galaxy (SMG), and two Ly-alpha emitters.
  - The QSO is the most luminous HF emitter yet found and has the same ratio of HF emission line to infrared luminosity as a sample of local AGN and the Orion Bar
  - The HF emission in the QSO is either excited by collisions with electrons and H2 in molecular plasmas irradiated by the AGN and intense star formation or predominately by collisions with H2, with a modest contribution from electrons
  - Although HF should be an excellent tracer of molecular outflows, we do not find strong evidence for outflows in HF in either the QSO or the SMG. From a putative absorption feature in HF in the SMG, we estimate an upper limit on the outflow rate
  - The lack of significant molecular outflows in either source may imply that much of the energy from the intense star formation and AGN activity in this pair is being dissipated in their ISM.

- [Strong chemical tagging with APOGEE: 21 candidate star clusters that have dissolved across the Milky Way disc](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.04263)
  - We apply a density-based clustering algorithm to the eight dimensional chemical space defined by [Mg/Fe], [Al/Fe], [Si/Fe], [K/Fe], [Ti/Fe], [Mn/Fe], [Fe/H], and [Ni/Fe]
  - We detect twenty-one candidate clusters with more than fifteen members.
  - Each group’s members are distributed over multiple kpc, and the spread in their radial and azimuthal actions increases with age

- [The Lyman Continuum Escape Fraction of Galaxies and AGN in the GOODS Fields](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.04360)
  - We present our analysis of the LyC emission and escape fraction of 111 spectroscopically verified galaxies with and without AGN from 2.26 < z < 4.3.
  - Among the 17 AGN from the 111 galaxies, one provided a LyC detection in F275W at mAB=23.19mag
  - We find the stack of 17 AGN dominate the LyC production from ⟨z⟩≃2.3−4.3 by a factor of ∼10 compared to all 94 galaxies without AGN.

- [Volumetric Star Formation Prescriptions in Vertically Resolved Edge-on Galaxies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.04363)
  - We find that the volumetric and surface SFLs in terms of the total gas have significantly different slopes, while the volumetric and surface SFLs in terms of the molecular gas do not show any noticeable difference.
  - We show that the interstellar gas pressure is strongly correlated with the SFR but find no significant difference between the correlations based on the volume and surface densities.

- [Evolution of the Thermodynamic Properties of Clusters of Galaxies out to Redshift of 1.8](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.04747)
  - **Interesting**
  - We find that thermodynamic properties in the outskirts of high redshift clusters are remarkably similar to the low redshift clusters, and their evolution follows the prediction of the self-similar model.
  - On the other hand, thermodynamic properties in the cluster cores deviates significantly from self-similarity indicating that the processes that regulate the core are already in place in these very high redshift clusters

- [2D-FFTLog: Efficient computation of real space covariance matrices for galaxy clustering and weak lensing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.04833)
  - Among various approaches to obtaining the covariance, analytic computation is much faster and less noisy than estimation from data or simulations. However, the transform of covariances from Fourier space to real space involves integrals with two Bessel integrals, which are numerically slow and easily affected by numerical uncertainties.
  - We introduce a 2D-FFTLog algorithm for efficient, accurate and numerically stable computation of non-Gaussian real space covariances.

- [Multi-phase outflows in post starburst E+A galaxies -- II. A direct connection between the neutral and ionized outflow phases](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.04749)
  - We present spatially-resolved IFU spectroscopy with MUSE/VLT of SDSS J124754.95-033738.6, a post starburst E+A galaxy with a recent starburst that started 70 Myrs ago and ended 30 Myrs ago, with a peak SFR of ∼150M⊙/yr
  - We detect disturbed gas throughout the entire field of view, suggesting triggering by a minor merger.
  - We detect fast-moving multi-phased gas clouds, embedded in a double-cone face-on outflow, which are traced by ionized emission lines and neutral NaID

- [GASP XXV: Neutral Hydrogen gas in the striking Jellyfish Galaxy JO204](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.04754)
  - The northern part of the galaxy disk has retained some HI gas, while the southern part has already been completely stripped and displaced into an extended unilateral tail.
  - We observe associated HI absorption against the 11 mJy central radio continuum source with an estimated HI absorption column density of 3.2 ×10^20 cm−2
  - The observed asymmetric absorption profile can therefore be explained by a clumpy, rotating HI gas disk seen partially in front of the central continuum source, or by ram-pressure pushing the neutral gas towards the center of the continuum source, triggering the AGN activity.

- [Direct Measurement of the HI-Halo Mass Relation through Stacking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.04762)
  - We find that the HI-halo mass relation is not a simple monotonic function, as assumed in several theoretical models. In addition to the dependence of halo mass, the total HI gas mass shows strong dependence on the halo richness, with larger HI masses in groups with more members at fixed halo masses
  - Moreover, halos with at least three member galaxies in the group catalog have a sharp decrease of the HI mass, potentially caused by the virial halo shock-heating and the AGN feedback.
  - HI气体主要来自质量<10^12.5 Msun halo的中心星系；<10^13 Msun halo里的HI主要靠并合增长

- [Liverpool-Maidanak monitoring of the Einstein Cross in 2006−2019. I. Light curves in the gVrRI optical bands and microlensing signatures](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.04991)
  - Through difference light curves, we found strong microlensing signatures. We then focused on the analytical modelling of two putative caustic-crossing events in image C, finding compelling evidence that this image experienced a double caustic crossing.
  - Our overall results indicate that a standard accretion disc accounts reasonably well for the brightness profile of UV continuum emission sources and for the growth in source radius when the emission wavelength increases

  - From a sample of 240 GRGs, we detected 37 sources in polarization, all with a total flux density above 56 mJy
  - Our analysis shows that the lobes are expanding into a low-density local environment permeated by weak magnetic fields (<0.1 µG) with fluctuations on scales of 3 to 25 kpc

- [Cosmology with the Wide-Field Infrared Survey Telescope -- Multi-Probe Strategies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.05271)
  - **CSST**
  - The 1.6 year HLS Reference survey is currently envisioned to image 2000 deg2 in multiple bands to a depth of ∼26.5 in Y, J, H and to cover the same area with slit-less spectroscopy beyond z=3.
  - We explore multi-probe strategies that can be implemented given WFIRST's instrument capabilities. We model cosmological probes individually and jointly and account for correlated systematics and statistical uncertainties due to the higher order moments of the density field

- [Noise from Undetected Sources in Dark Energy Survey Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.05618)
  - **Relevant, CSST**
  - Using injection of artifical galaxies into images, we demonstrate that the measured variance of galaxy moments (used for weak gravitational lensing measurements) in Dark Energy Survey (DES) images is significantly in excess of the Poisson predictions, by up to 30%, and that the background sky levels are overestimated by current software.
  - By cross-correlating distinct images of “empty” sky regions, we establish that there is a significant image noise contribution from undetected static sources (US),
  - We also find that local sky determinations can remove the bias in flux measurements, at a small penalty in additional, but quantifiable, noise.

- [The relation between galaxies and the warm-hot circumgalactic medium probed with X-ray and UV line absorption in the EAGLE simulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.05171)
  - Halo gas dominates the highest column density absorption for X-ray lines, but lower-density gas contributes to strong UV absorption lines from O VI and Ne VIII.
  - We predict that the Athena X-IFU will be able to observe O VII (O VIII) covering fractions within 100 pkpc of 77 (46) per cent around M⋆=10^10.5−11.0M⊙ galaxies
  - The circumgalactic medium (CGM) contains more metals than the interstellar medium across halo masses.

- [The Isaac Newton Telescope monitoring survey of Local Group dwarf galaxies. I. Survey overview and first results for Andromeda I](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.05620)
  - The main aims of this survey are to identify the most evolved asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars and red supergiants at the end-point of their evolution based on their pulsational instability
  - We detected 5581 stars and identified 59 LPV candidates within two half-light radii of the centre of And I. The amplitudes of these candidates range from 0.2 to 3 mag in the i-band. 75 % of detected sources and 98 % of LPV candidates are detected at mid-infrared wavelengths

- [Discovery of Radio Jets in Phoenix Galaxy Cluster Center](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.05724)
  - We spatially resolved radio emission around the BCG, and found diffuse bipolar and bar-shape structures extending from the active galactic nucleus (AGN) of the BCG.
  - If we assume that the radio jets/lobes expand with the sound velocity, their ages are estimated to be ~10 Myr.
  - We also found compact radio emissions near the center and suggest that they are another young bipolar jets with ~1 Myr of age.

- [Properties of environment around AGN and luminous galaxy pairs through HSC wide survey](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.05888)
  - The target AGNs were drawn from the Million Quasars (MILLIQUAS) catalog, and the blue galaxies were drawn from six redshift survey catalogs (SDSS, WiggleZ, DEEP2, VVDS, VIPERS, and PRIMUS).
  - We found that, among the five AGN and blue galaxy samples considered, the environment of AGN-LG pairs is the most enriched with luminous galaxies.
  - The results obtained in this study indicate that existence of multiple clusters is the major driver in the association of AGNs and LGs, rather than a single large-mass dark matter halo hosting the AGN.

- [A systematic study of galactic outflows via fluorescence emission: implications for their size and structure](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.06105)
  - We find that in the majority of cases the observed fluorescence emission lines are much weaker and narrower than the absorption lines, originating in the star-forming interstellar medium and/or the slowest-moving part of the inner outflow.
    - 大部分情况里outflow的荧光发射很弱，due to the missing emission arising on scales larger than those encompassed by the aperture of the HST
  - In a minority of cases, the outflowing absorbing material does make a significant contribution to the fluorescence emission. These latter systems are characterized by both strong Lyα emission lines and weak low-ionization absorption lines (both known to be empirical signs of Lyman-continuum leakage).

- [Improved constraints on reionisation from CMB observations: A parameterisation of the kSZ effect](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.06616)
  - In the context of patchy reionisation, an accurate description of the angular power spectrum of the kinetic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (kSZ) effect is not possible with simple scaling relations between the amplitude of the spectrum and global parameters such as the reionisation midpoint and its duration.
  - We introduce a new parameterisation of this spectrum, based on a novel description of the power spectrum of the free electrons density contrast Pee(k,z) in terms of reionisation global history and morphology.
  - We directly relate features of the spectrum to the typical ionised bubble size at different stages in the process, and subsequently to the angular scale at which the patchy kSZ power spectrum reaches its maximum.

  - we compare different approaches to estimate FIR line emission from state-of-the-art cosmological simulations, either with CLOUDY or with on-the-fly non-equilibrium chemistry. We find that
    - [CII]158μ predictions are robust.
    - [OI] emission lines are instead model-dependent, as these lines are strongly affected by the thermodynamic state of the gas and non-equilibrium photoionisation effects.

- [Galaxy pairs in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey -- XIV. Galaxy mergers do not lie on the Fundamental Metallicity Relation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.06121)
  - Despite the qualitative consistency with FMR expectations, the observed O/H dilution in galaxy pairs of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey is stronger than what is predicted by the FMR.
  - We find that galaxies in pairs are consistent with the FMR only when their separation is larger than 110 kpc.
  - We find that pairs are more sensitive to a second companion than to the local galaxy density, displaying less elevated SFRs with smaller values of r2.

- [Star formation traced by optical and millimeter hydrogen recombination lines and free-free emissions in the dusty merging galaxy NGC 3256 -- MUSE/VLT and ALMA synergy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.06123)
  - MUSE+ALMA观测： The Hβ image obtained by MUSE identifies star-forming regions outside the nuclear regions, suggesting a disk-wide starburst. In contrast, the H40α image obtained by ALMA identifies a nuclear starburst where optical lines are undetected due to dust extinction (AV∼25).
  - This suggests the dominance of disk-wide star formation in NGC~3256.

- [The detailed structure and the onset of galaxy formation in low-mass gaseous dark matter haloes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.06124)
  - In this model, galaxy formation can only take place in dark matter haloes whose mass exceeds a redshift-dependent critical value, which, before reionization, is equal (in the simplest case) to the mass at which atomic hydrogen cooling becomes effective and, after reionization, is equal to the mass above which gas cannot remain in hydrostatic equilibrium
  - 预测固定Halo质量上多少比例的halo里面有星系：预测现在5x10^9 Msun以上的halo里100%有星系；3x10^8 Msun一下的halo里星系比例就显著下降了

  - We investigate the recovery of high-redshift 5< z <12 galaxies through extensive image simulations of accepted JWST programs such as CEERS
  - We find that the photometric redshifts are primarily limited by the availability of blue-band and near-infrared medium-band imaging.
  - The faint-end slope of the galaxy UV luminosity function is recovered with a precision of 0.1−0.25, and the cosmic star-formation rate density within 0.1 dex.

- [Ejective and preventative: the IllustrisTNG black hole feedback and its effects on the thermodynamics of the gas within and around galaxies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.06132)
  - We find that gas entropy is a sensitive diagnostic of feedback injection. In particular, we demonstrate how the onset of the low-accretion BH feedback mode, realised in the IllustrisTNG model as a kinetic, BH-driven wind, leads not only to star-formation quenching at stellar masses ≳10^10.5M⊙ but also to a change in thermodynamic properties of the (non-star-forming) gas, both within the galaxy and beyond.
  - The same AGN feedback channel is simultaneously "ejective" and "preventative" and leaves an imprint on the temperature, density, entropy, and cooling times also in the outer reaches of the gas halo

- [Fundamental relations for the velocity dispersion of stars in the Milky Way](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.06556)
  - In addition to the well-known dependence on stellar age, the velocity dispersions of stars depend on orbital angular momentum Lz, metallicity and height above the plane |z|, and are well described by a multiplicatively separable functional form.
  - Even though they target different tracer populations and employ a variety of age estimation techniques, follow the same set of fundamental relations.
  - The dispersions increase with decreasing metallicity, suggesting that the dispersions increase with birth radius. The dispersions also increase linearly with |z|.

- [Minimum size of cosmological 21-cm simulations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.06709)
  - The first galaxies are likely very rare and biased, with their abundances modulated by long wavelength modes of the density field. Moreover, the radiation fields from these galaxies interact with the IGM over a large range of scales. Therefore, the limited volume of 21-cm simulations can underestimate the amount of structure in the signal.
  - We find that simulations of box lengths 200-300 Mpc typically do not show a bias in the PS during the EoR; however, they do tend to underestimate the large-scale power during the earlier epoch of CD by ~7-9 % on average.
  - We conclude that box lengths of 250 Mpc are needed to converge at the level of <~1 sigma of the total noise.

  - A tilted CMZ might provide an alternative explanation to the ∞-shaped structuere identified in Herschel data
  - The bar in our simulation efficiently drives an inflow from the Galactic disc (R≃3 kpc) down to the CMZ: 1 Msun/yr
  - Self-gravity and supernovae feedback can drive an inflow from the CMZ inwards towards the circumnuclear disc: 0.03 Msun/yr

- [Simulations of the Milky Way's central molecular zone -- II. Star formation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.06731)

  - We observed 1.4 GHz continuum and HI emission with the Very Large Array in its B-configuration in two fields of the Coma cluster to study the radio properties of RPS galaxies.
  - Radio continuum tails are found in 10 (8 are new) out of 20 RPS galaxies, unambiguously revealing the presence of relativistic electrons and magnetic fields in the stripped tails.
  - The 1.4 GHz continuum in the tails is enhanced relative to their Hα emission by a factor of ∼7 compared to the main bodies of the RPS galaxies. The 1.4 GHz continuum of the RPS galaxies is enhanced relative to their IR emission by a factor of ∼2 compared to star-forming galaxies.
  - No evidence of radio emission associated with ultra-diffuse galaxies is found in our data.

  - We report H I absorption detection towards seven radio AGNs, six of which are new.
  - Compact radio AGNs with WISE colour W2−W3 >2 have higher detection rates compared to those with W2−W3 <2.
  - We find that while LERGs show a wide range in the shift of centroid velocities (∼ −479 to +356 km s−1) relative to the optical systemic velocity, most of the HERGs have centroid velocity shift less than 200 km s−1, possibly due to differences in jet-interstellar medium interaction.

- [Detection of the Schwarzschild precession in the orbit of the star S2 near the Galactic centre massive black hole](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.07187)

  - Owing to its highly elliptical orbit (e = 0.88), S2's SP is mainly a kink between the pre-and post-pericentre directions of motion ~ +- 1 year around pericentre passage, relative to the corresponding Kepler orbit.
  - The S2 data are fully consistent with GR. Any extended mass inside S2's orbit cannot exceed ~ 0.1% of the central mass. Any compact third mass inside the central arcsecond must be less than about 1000 M_sun.

  - 利用ABACUS模拟：we show how observed deviations from self-similarity reveal the range of time and distance scales in which convergence is obtained.
  - With a small force softening length, the spatial resolution is essentially determined by the mass resolution.

- [Localizing Transformations of the Galaxy-Galaxy Lensing Observable](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.07504)
  - **Interesting**
  - Because the predicted tangential shear signal at a given separation depends on the physical modeling on all scales internal to that separation, systematic uncertainties in the modeling of non-linear small scales are propagated outwards to larger scales.
  - We construct a simple linear transformation of the observable that removes this non-locality, enabling more aggressive small-scale cuts for a given theoretical model. Our modified galaxy-galaxy lensing observable makes it possible to include observations on significantly smaller scales than those under the standard approach in cosmological analyses.

- [Minimising the impact of scale-dependent galaxy bias on the joint cosmological analysis of large scale structures](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.07811)
  - We present a mitigation strategy to reduce the impact of non-linear galaxy bias on the joint `3×2pt' cosmological analysis of weak lensing and galaxy surveys.
  - The Ψ-statistics that we adopt are based on Complete Orthogonal Sets of E/B Integrals (COSEBIs).
  - 替代传统的2PCF和lensing统计，但同样有限制能力
  - Given the challenges in determining accurate galaxy bias models in the highly non-linear regime, we argue that 3×2pt analyses should move towards new statistics that are less sensitive to the smallest physical scales.

- [Stochastic Processes as the Origin of the Double-Power Law Shape of the Quasar Luminosity Function](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.07412)
  - **Relevant** QSO Mh-MUV关系中scatter的影响
  - We employ a conditional luminosity function and construct the relation between median quasar magnitude versus halo mass MUV,c(Mh) with log-normal in luminosity scatter Σ, and duty-cycle ϵDC, and focus on high redshift z≳4.
  - In order to reproduce the observed QLF, the Σ=0 abundance matching requires all of the brightest quasars to be hosted in the rarest most massive dark-matter halos (with an increasing MUV,c/Mh in halo mass)
  - Conversely, for Σ>0 the brightest quasars can be over-luminous outliers hosted in relatively common dark-matter halos.
  - We investigate the impact of ϵDC and Σ on measurements of clustering and find there is no luminosity dependence on clustering for Σ>0.3, consistent with recent observations from Subaru HSC.

  - we study 256 SZ sources with Dec≥−15∘ (212 of them completely unknown), finding optical counterparts for 152 SZ sources.
  - We find a strong correlation between the number of unconfirmed sources and the thermal emission of diffuse galactic dust at 857 GHz, thus increasing the fraction of false Planck SZ detections at low galactic latitudes.

  - For Euclid, we find that the addition of JH 5σ photometric detections can reduce the standard deviation for galaxies with z>1 (z>0.3) by ∼20% (∼10%), and the fraction of outliers by ∼40% (∼25%).
  - For WFIRST, we show how the addition of deep YJHK photometry could reduce the standard deviation by ≳50% at z>1.5 and drastically reduce the fraction of outliers to just ∼2% overall.

  - The thickness of the FP depends strongly on morphology. If the sample only includes E-SRs, then the observed scatter in Re is ∼16%, of which only ∼9% is intrinsic. 只看质量>10^11 Msun的星系scatter会更小
  - The observed scatter increases to the ∼25% usually quoted in the literature if E-FRs and S0s are added.
  - The structure within the FP is most easily understood as arising from the fact that Ie and σe are nearly independent, whereas the Re−Ie and Re−σe correlations are nearly equal and opposite.
  - Accounting self-consistently for M∗/L gradients will change the tilt. The tilt we currently see suggests that the efficiency of turning baryons into stars increases and/or the dark matter fraction decreases as stellar surface brightness increases.

  - The mass function of ROCKSTAR halos, on the other hand, shows good convergence from of order 50 to 100 particles per halo, with no detectable evidence at the one percent level of any systematic dependence for larger particle number.

- [Lessons on early structure formation from a mature galaxy cluster observed at cosmic noon](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.08479)
  - With the standard Press Schechter formalism, we infer a rapid evolution of the star formation efficiency (the ratio of stellar to halo mass) from 10^-4 to 0.01 during z~20-13, based on the age distribution of stars in post-starburst galaxies of XLSSC 122

- [Cosmology-insensitive estimate of IGM baryon mass fraction from five localized fast radio bursts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.08393)

  - Using the measured dispersion measure (DM) and luminosity distance dL data (inferred from the FRB redshifts and dL of type Ia supernovae at the same redshifts) of the five FRBs, we constrain the local fIGM=0.84+0.16−0.22 with no evidence of redshift dependence.
  - Using the three apparently non-repeating FRBs only we get a little looser but consistent result fIGM=0.74+0.24−0.18.
  - The constraints on both fIGM and DMhost are expected to be significantly improved with the rapid progress in localizing FRBs.

  - We discovered Bowen emission arising from a strongly lensed (μ>20) transient stellar object hosted in the Sunburst arc at z=2.37.
  - Unique ultraviolet lines emerge at the location of the transient. In particular, narrow (σv ~ 40 km/s) ionisation lines of several chemical species (Fe, C, Si) fluoresce after being exposed to Lyman series (e.g., Lyα, Lyβ) of H, HeI and HeII that pump selectively their atomic levels.

  - 再电离之前，辐射反馈只抑制<10^9.5 Msun的halo里的SF，对大质量的halo没有影响

  - Structure function分析显示光变和光度有正相关；这个趋势和luminous quasar中的相反
  - 看host星系的贡献：This suggests that low-luminosity AGNs at 0.8≲z≲1.8 are predominantly hosted in star-forming galaxies.
  - The stacked samples show very large hardness ratios in their stacked X-ray spectrum, which suggests that these optically variable sources have large soft X-ray absorption by dust-free gas.

- [The duty cycle of radio galaxies revealed by LOFAR: remnant and restarted radio source populations in the Lockman Hole](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.08979)

  - Radio AGN in Semi-Analytic Environments (RAiSE) dynamical model模型研究Lockman Hole的LOFAR观测：our models predict that remnant radio lobes fade quickly.
  - Any high (>10 percent) observed fraction of remnant and restarted sources therefore requires a dominant population of short-lived jets. We speculate that this could plausibly be provided by feedback-regulated accretion.

- [The life cycle of radio galaxies in the LOFAR Lockman Hole field](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.09118)
  - **Interesting**
  - We used deep LOFAR images at 150 MHz of the Lockman Hole extragalactic field to select a sample of 158 radio sources with sizes >60′′ in different phases of their jet life cycle.
  - We selected a subsample of candidate restarted radio galaxies representing between 13% and 15% of the 158 sources of the main sample. 要和上面那篇连起来看，这个比例是很高的。
  - 正在活跃的，已经是remnant的，和restarted的射点星系的光学宿主性质并无差异，应该来自同一个母样本
  - The fraction of restarted radio galaxies is slightly higher with respect to remnants, suggesting that the restarted phase can often follow after a relatively short remnant phase
  - **This confirms that the remnant and restarted phases are integral parts of the life cycle of massive elliptical galaxies.**

  - 气体密度和SFR密度差异非常大，但是气体消耗时标都很长：relatively high gas surface densities (Σgas) and low star formation rate densities (ΣSFR), have by far the highest Lyα escape fraction.
  - Lya逃逸比例和总气体消耗时标有明显相关：Lyα escape in those galaxies is driven by turbulence in the star-forming gas that shifts the Lyα photons out of resonance close to the places where they originate.
  - We further report on an extreme [C II]158μm excess in LARS 5, corresponding to ∼14±3% of the FIR luminosity, i.e. the most extreme [C II]-to-FIR ratio observed in a non-AGN galaxy to date.

  - 分布靠近filaments：structures with PFG≥50% are located close to the cosmic web filaments (87% are located at less than 1 Mpc from their nearest filament). 距离node很远
  - Being in a poor environment could therefore be the driver of FG formation, the number of nearby galaxies not being sufficient to compensate for the cannibalism of the central group galaxy.

  - We report the first tentative observations at 21cm of ongoing ram-pressure stripping at z=0.2, as well as observed inflow of low-entropy gas into the cluster along filaments of the large-scale structure.
  - Gas rich, star forming galaxies are being accreted from the east and west of the cluster and these galaxies are being quenched at r<R200, while the bulk of the accretion, containing multiple groups, happens along the north-south axis and brings mostly passive galaxies.

  - In analysing our stacked samples binned by redshift, we find evidence for a central excess of UV background light compared to local backgrounds for clusters with z<0.3
  - We measure the stacked radial profile of these clusters, and find that the excess UV radiation decays to the level of the background at a radius of ∼1 Mpc
  - Analysis of possible physical processes contributing to the excess UV brightness indicates that non-thermal emission from relativistic electrons in the intracluster medium and faint, unresolved UV emission from cluster member galaxies and intracluster light are likely the dominant contributors.

  - 在观测上还因为：the galaxy surface density profiles approximately following Sersic profiles with their Re and Sersic index (n) anti-correlated
  - 存在一个面密度值，使得mass-size关系的scatter最小：The physical reason for the existence of optimal values is unknown but, as Trujillo+20 point out, they are close to the gas surface density threshold to form stars and thus may trace the physical end of a galaxy.

  - The uncertainty escalates to ~60% for lower resolution. Inclusion of the low SNR pixels causes the uncertainty in the inferred gradient to deteriorate.

  - A physically-motivated model of the matter power spectrum, based on the halo model and perturbation theory
  - Our key ansatz is that the number density of halos depends on the non-linear density contrast filtered on some unknown scale R.
  - Due to its physical motivation, the statistics can be easily extended beyond the power spectrum; we additionally derive the one-loop covariance matrices of cluster counts and their combination with the matter power spectrum.

  - We use hydrodynamical cosmological simulations run with the AREPO code to investigate the potential detectability of large-scale filaments, excluding contributions from the halos embedded in them
  - For a MUSE integration of 31 hours, including feedback increases the detectable area by a factor of ≃5.5 on average compared with simulations without feedback
  - Finally, we find the majority of Lyα emission is due to electron impact collisional excitations, as opposed to radiative recombination.

  - 因为高红移GMC结构更compact，气体压力和湍动都更大；The compactness also delays GMC dispersal by stellar feedback, thus ∼40% of the total UV radiation emitted by newly born stars remains obscured.

  - The gas-phase metallicity in NGC 4418 significantly exceeds that in VV 655. No kinematic disturbances in the ionized gas are observed along the minor axis of NGC 4418.
  - The simplest model suggests that the minor interaction between VV 655 and NGC 4418 produced the unusual nuclear properties of the LIRG via tidal torquing of the interstellar medium of NGC 4418 rather than through a significant gas transfer event. In addition to inducing a central concentration of gas in NGC 4418, this interaction also produced an enhanced star formation rate and an outer tidal arm in the LIRG.

  - At a later stage, dwarf galaxies, in mini mergers (mass-ratio < 1:10), were accreted building-up the outer slowly rotating spheroid, with the central disk kinematics largely unaltered.
  - 发现有一部分UCD follow GC rotation pattern，可能是in-situ的；有一部分不是，可能是ex-situ的

  - There is good agreement with established relations down to SFR≃10^−3M⊙yr−1, below which an excess of X-ray luminosity emerges. 超出的部分可能来自LMXB
  - Different star formation indicators scale with LX in different ways, and we attribute the differences to the effect of star formation history.
  - The SFR derived from Hα shows the tightest correlation with X-ray luminosity because Hα emission probes stellar populations with ages similar to HMXB formation timescales

- [It's Dust: Solving the Mysteries of the Intrinsic Scatter and Host-Galaxy Dependence of Standardized Type Ia Supernova Brightnesses](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.10206)
  - **Important**
  - SN Ia intrinsic scatter的大部分可以被尘埃消光所解释：We introduce a physical model of color where intrinsic SN Ia colors with a relatively weak correlation with luminosity are combined with extrinsic dust-like colors (E(B−V)) with a wide range of extinction parameter values (RV).
  - We also find that the recovered E(B−V) and RV distributions differ based on global host-galaxy stellar mass and this explains the observed correlation (γ) between mass and Hubble residuals seen in past analyses
  - Finally we measure biases in the equation-of-state of dark energy (w) up to |Δw|=0.04 by replacing previous models of SN color with our dust-based model; this bias is larger than any systematic uncertainty in previous SN Ia cosmological analyses.

- [Towards Universal Cosmological Emulators with Generative Adversarial Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.10223)

  - 175个有Spitzer IRS和X-ray数据的BASS AGN；the silicate strength is weakly correlated with the hydrogen column density
  - We find that the optical type 1 AGNs with strong X-ray absorption on average show significant silicate absorption, indicating that their X-ray absorption might not be caused by dust-free gas in the broad-line region.

- [COLDz: A High Space Density of Massive Dusty Starburst Galaxies ~1 Billion Years after the Big Bang](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.10204)
  - JVLA在z>5的大质量富尘埃星暴星系中探测到了CO(2-1)；全部都是optical dark的源
  - Our results appear to imply a ∼6-55 times higher space density of such distant dusty systems within the first billion years after the Big Bang than previously thought
  - At least two of these z>5 galaxies show star-formation rate surface densities consistent with so-called "maximum" starbursts, but we find significant differences in CO excitation between them.
  - We thus find substantial variations in the conditions for star formation between z>5 dusty starbursts, which typically have dust temperatures ∼57%±25% warmer than starbursts at z=2-3

- [Measuring Star Formation Histories, Distances, and Metallicities with Pixel Color-Magnitude Diagrams II: Applications to Nearby Elliptical Galaxies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.10213)
  - **Relevant**
  - We compute pCMDs from archival HST photometry of M87, M49, NGC 3377 and M31, and fit the data using the new code 𝙿𝙲𝙼𝙳𝙿𝚢. We measure distances to each system that are accurate to ∼10%. The recovered non-parametric SFHs place reasonable (±1 dex) constraints on the recent (< 2 Gyr) star formation in M31 and NGC 3377

- [Size distribution of superbubbles](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.10214)
  - 之前的假设：bubbles stall when pressure equilibrium is reached 在现在的数值模拟看来并不成立
  - 需要考虑环境ISM的非热压力：Assuming that bubbles stall when the outer shock speed becomes comparable to the ambient sound speed (which includes non-thermal components), we recover the size distribution with a slope of ∼−2.7 for typical values of ISM pressure in Milky Way
  - We show that the size distribution steepens with lower pressure, to slopes intermediate between only-growing and only-stalled cases.

- [The Star Formation in Radio Survey: 3 - 33 GHz Imaging of Nearby Galaxy Nuclei and Extranuclear Star-forming Regions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.10230)

- [Dust Reverberation of 3C273: torus structure and lag -- luminosity relation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.10244)
  - Cross correlations between the V-band and the dust light curves yield an average rest-frame delay for the hot dust of tau_cent ~ 410 days. This is a factor 2 shorter than expected from the the dust ring radius R_x ~ 900 light days
  - The dust covering factor (CF) is about 8%, much smaller than predicted from the half covering angle of 45 degree found for active galactic nuclei (AGN).

  - Here we turn to consider the large-scale clustering information of observed DM of FRB catalog, which only needs the rough redshift distribution
  - 10^4  FRBs with the intrinsic DM scatter of 100 pc/cm3 spanning 20\% of all sky, could significantly improve the constraint on the width Δz of the model,
  - The large-scale clustering information of observed DM of FRB catalog is very sensitive to the ionization fraction of the end of reionization epoch.

  - We present the discovery of a new giant radio relic around the galaxy cluster Abell 2249 (z=0.0838) using LOFAR 是发现的里面面亮度最低的
  - 多波段射电观测：We infer for this radio relic a lower bound on the magnetisation of B≥0.4μG, a shock Mach number of M≈3.79, and a low acceleration efficiency consistent with DSA. 以后可能发现更多这类的

- [The multiwavelength counterparts of fast radio bursts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.10787)
  - We demonstrate a technique to estimate the ratio, η, between the energy outputs of FRB counterparts at various wavelengths and the radio-wavelength emission.
  - In some scenarios for the FRB engine and emission mechanism, we find that FRB counterparts should have already been detected, thus demonstrating that our technique can successfully test predictions for η.

- [The multiwavelength counterparts of fast radio bursts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.10787)
  - We present a Bayesian method for the detection of quasar periodicity in the presence of red noise
  - 用PG1302-102测试：there is very strong support-with a Bayes factor greater than 105-for periodicity, despite the fact that the inclusion of ASAS-SN data reduces the detection significance

- [The GOGREEN Survey: A deep stellar mass function of cluster galaxies at 1.0<z<1.4 and the complex nature of satellite quenching](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.10757)
  - **Relevant**
  - The quenched fraction excess (QFE) represents the fraction of galaxies that would be star-forming in the field, but are quenched due to their environment. The QFE is strongly mass dependent, and increases from ~30% at Mstar=10^9.7 Msun, to ~80% at Mstar=10^11.0 Msun.
  - 但cluster和field里的SF和Quiescent星系的SMF的shape是一致的；Yet, along with the different quiescent fractions is the total galaxy SMF environmentally dependent, with a relative deficit of low-mass galaxies in the clusters.; 这和local universe是不一样的

- [The ALPINE-ALMA [CII] Survey: Dust Attenuation Properties and Obscured Star-Formation at z~4.4-5.8](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.10760)
  - The individual detections and stacks show that the IRX-β relation at z~5 is consistent with a steeper dust attenuation curve than typically found at lower redshifts (z<4).
  - The attenuation curve is similar to or even steeper than that of the extinction curve of the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC).
  - 尘埃性质在z>4有演化；This implies a lower obscured fraction of star-formation than at lower redshifts.
  - 尘埃在大质量星系中build-up很快：even among this UV-selected sample, massive galaxies (logM⋆/M⊙>10) at z~5-6 already exhibit an obscured fraction of star formation of ∼45%

- [CHAOS V: Recombination Line Carbon Abundances in M101](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.10765)
  - **Interesting**
  - We present CHAOS LBT observations of C II λ4267 emission detected in 10 H II regions in M 101 结合电离模型改正，测量总的C丰度
  - We measure a relatively steep gradient in log(C/H) of -0.37 +/- 0.06 dex/R_e
  - C/N基本恒定且弥散很小；考虑到各种可以产生C和N的核合成渠道，这个比较难理解
  - If the high surface brightness necessary for the detection of the faint recombination lines is interpreted as an indicator of H II region youth, then this may point to a lack of nitrogen pollution in the youngest H II regions.
  - 光学波段没有够强的碰撞电离的C线，HII区里测C丰度比较难: CIII] at λλ1907, 1909; C II recombination line at λ4267
    - C丰度在低金属丰度端来自大质量恒星，与O/H关系一致；在高金属丰度端，随丰度升高；可能是高金属丰度导致的星风增强的影响，或者是中等质量恒星的yield随丰度变化的影响；N/O有类似的趋势，C/N基本变化不大，但原因不同；N/O随丰度增加是CNO循环的直接后果
    - Absolute ionic abundances from recombination lines should be very robust because of the negligible dependence on temperature when converting from line flux ratios to abundances.
    - 但当必须和碰撞电离的发射线比较的时候，就需要考虑 abundance discrepancy factor的影响；碰撞电离线的相对强度对温度高度敏感，所以ADF反应了HII区内的温度起伏。

- [The ALPINE-ALMA [CII] survey: Molecular gas budget in the Early Universe as traced by [CII]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.10771)
  - The agreement between molecular gas masses derived from [CII] luminosity, dynamical mass, and rest-frame 850um luminosity, extrapolated from the rest-frame 158um continuum, supports [CII] as a reliable tracer of molecular gas in our sample.
  - Our estimates show that the rise in molecular gas fraction as reported previously, flattens off above z~3.7 to achieve a mean value of 63%+/-3 over z=4.4-5.9.

  - core-Einasto profile: to allow for a pronounced constant-density core in the resolved innermost radius.
  - We find that dark matter core formation is most efficient at the characteristic stellar-mass to halo-mass ratio M⋆/Mhalo≃5×10^−3, or M⋆∼10^9M⊙, with cores that are roughly the size of the galaxy half-light radius
  - Even at the Milky Way scale, FIRE-2 galaxy formation still produces small dark matter cores of ≃0.5−2 kpc in size.

  - We present new high quality optical and near-infrared spectroscopy of the z=7.00 quasar DES J025216.64--050331.8 obtained with Keck/NIRES and Gemini/GMOS
  - Furthermore, the Lyα region of the spectrum exhibits a strong damping wing absorption feature. The lack of associated metal absorption in the quasar spectrum indicates that this absorption is imprinted by a neutral IGM. 中性气体比例>70%，是目前在EoR阶段测到的最高的

- [Astraeus II: Quantifying the impact of cosmic variance during the Epoch of Reionization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.11096)
  - We find that different reionization scenarios play a minor role in the cosmic variance.
  - Most of the cosmic variance is completely driven by the underlying density field and increases above 100% for MUV∼ -17.5 (-20) at z = 12 (6) for the JADES-deep survey
  - We find that the faint-end slope of the Lyman Break Galaxies (LBGs) UV LF becomes increasingly shallower with increasing reionization feedback and show how JWST observations will be able to distinguish between different models of reionization feedback at z > 9, even accounting for cosmic variance.

  - Borderline FRI/FRII giant radio galaxy NGC 6251: revealing for the first time a low-surface-brightness extension to the northern lobe, and a possible backflow associated with the southern lobe.
  - We find the outer structures of NGC 6251 to be either at equipartition or slightly electron dominated, similar to those of FRII sources rather than FRIs

- [Differences and similarities of stellar populations in LAEs and LBGs at z∼ 3.4 - 6.8](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.11175)
  - This work focuses on the differences between the three different observational subfamilies of our sample: LAE-LBGs, no-Lyα LBGs and pure LAEs. 大部分都可以用单次星暴来拟合SED
  - LAE更像是年轻低质量星系，正在经历第一次星暴；no-Lya LBGs年龄较老，质量较大
  - LAE-LBG往往需要两个星族来描述；可能是重新开启了SF的"老年"星系
  - The relative number of sources found from each subfamily at each z supports an evolutionary scenario from pure LAEs and single SP LAE-LBGs to more massive LBGs.

- [Optimal void finders in weak lensing maps](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.11387)
  - We study how the properties of weak lensing voids depend on the choice of void finder, by adapting several popular void finders.
  - By studying the signal-to-noise ratios (SNR) for the tangential shear profile of each void finder, we find that voids identified directly in the convergence maps have the highest SNR but are also the ones most affected by galaxy shape noise.
  - The tunnel algorithm, which identifies voids in the distribution of weak lensing peaks, represents a good compromise between finding a large tangential shear SNR and mitigating the effect of galaxy shape noise.

- [Cosmology with gravitationally lensed repeating Fast Radio Bursts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.11643)
  - We discuss a new way of using time delays for cosmology, taking advantage of the extreme precision expected for lensed Fast Radio Bursts, short flashes of radio emission originating at cosmological distances.
  - It turns out that uncertainties arising from the unknown mass distribution of gravitational lenses can be eliminated by combining time delays with their time derivatives. Other effects, most importantly relative proper motion, can be measured accurately and separated from the cosmological effects.

- [State-of-the-art AGN SEDs for Photoionization Models: BLR Predictions Confront the Observations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.11873)
  - AGN研究的很多问题是紫外段intrinsic SED的不确定：the spectral energy distribution (SED) between the Lyman limit, where intervening absorption becomes a problem, and 0.3 keV, where soft x-ray observations become possible
  - 本文给出理论SED模型 as a function of Eddington ratio; 能量守恒，可以和观测比较
  - The SEDs become more far-ultraviolet bright as the Eddington ratio increases, so the equivalent widths of recombination lines should also become larger
  - The observed lack of correlation between Eddington ratio and equivalent width shows that the cloud covering factor must decrease as Eddington ratio increases.

- [Timing the Early Assembly of the Milky Way with the H3 Survey](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.11384)
  - **Important**
  - We use 11,000 main-sequence turn-off stars with well-measured ages, [Fe/H], [α/Fe], and orbits from the H3 Survey and Gaia to time the major events in the early Galaxy.
  - 在距离银盘1-4 kpc的位置上有三组恒星：

    2. High-Z, high-alpha group: 包括了盘恒星和in-situ halo; has a star-formation history independent of eccentricity that abruptly truncated 8.3±0.1 Gyr ago
    3. High-Z, low-alpha group: is primarily on low eccentricity orbits and the bulk of its stars formed less than 8 Gyr ago.
  - MW在10Gyr以前吸积了一个satellite星系，并在8Gyr年前并合；并合活动终止了恒星形成活动，并扰动了一部分薄盘恒星进入halo-like orbits

- [Ultra-diffuse galaxies in the Coma cluster: Probing their origin and AGN occupation fraction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.11388)
  - **Relevant**
  - To constrain the formation scenario of UDGs, we probe the X-ray emission originating from diffuse gas and from the population of unresolved low-mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs) residing in globular clusters (GCs)
  - We do not detect statistically significant emission from the hot gas or from GC-LMXBs. 上限估计限制UDG的halo质量都比较低
  - We identify two UDGs that have a luminous X-ray source at 3.0" and 3.2" from the center of the galaxies, which could be off-center AGN. However, Monte Carlo simulations suggest that one of these sources could be the result of spatial coincidence with a background AGN.

- [A missing outskirts problem? Comparisons between stellar halos in the Dragonfly Nearby Galaxies Survey and the TNG100 simulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.11402)
  - **Relevant**
  - We measure azimuthally averaged stellar mass density and surface brightness profiles, and find that the DNGS galaxies generally have less stellar mass (or light) at large radii (>20 kpc) compared to their mass-matched TNG100 counterparts
  - Simulated galaxies with similar surface density profiles tend to have low accreted mass fractions for their stellar mass.
  - We find that artificially delaying the disruption of satellite galaxies and reducing the spatial extent of in-situ stellar populations result in improved matches between the outer profile shapes and stellar halo masses

- [Cosmic evolution of molecular gas mass density from an empirical relation between L1.4GHz and L′CO](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.11442)
  - We find a correlation between the radio continuum and the CO emission line (with a scatter of 0.36 dex), in a large sample of different kind of galaxies.
  - The cosmic molecular gas density increases up to z=1.5.
  - L_CO, L_IR, L_1.4GHz form a plane

- [Statistics and Properties of Emission-Line Regions in the Local Volume Dwarf Galaxies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.11550)
  - The sample consists of three hundred galaxies of the irregular (Irr), Magellanic irregular (Im), blue compact dwarf (BCD), and transition (Tr) types situated within a distance of 11 Mpc.
  - The larger luminosity of a galaxy, the greater number of compact HII-sources in it.
  - SFR和星系中的HII区数目有相关，说明了SF的周期性
  - The dwarf galaxies with emission-line bubbles, or filaments, or signs of the global star-formation burst have approximately the same hydrogen-mass-to-luminosity ratio as that of the whole sample objects. However, their mean star-formation rate is significantly higher than that of other galaxies

- [Planes of satellites around simulated disc galaxies: I.- Finding high-quality planar configurations from positional information and their comparison to MW/M31 data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.11585)
  - We extend the 4-galaxy-normal density plot method (Pawlowski et al. 2013) in a way designed to efficiently identify the best quality planes
  - At all timesteps analyzed in both simulations we find satellite planar configurations that are compatible, along given time intervals, with all the spatial characteristics of observed planes identified using the same methodology. 但co-orbiting卫星的比例偏低

- [Barred galaxies in the Illustris-1 and TNG100 simulations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.11620)
  - **Interesting**
  - At z=0, 8.9\% of 1232 disc galaxies with stellar mass >1010.5M⊙ in Illustris-1 are barred, while the numbers are 55\% of 1269 in TNG100. 在TNG里和S4G巡天相符合
  - Median formation redshift = 0.4-0.5 in TNG
  - Bar比例在TNG中随质量升高，随气体比例下降：Barred galaxy had higher gas fraction at high redshift tend to form bar later. When the bars were formed, the disc gas fractions were mostly lower than 0.4.
  - Barred galaxies have higher star formation rate before bar formation, and stronger AGN feedback all the time than unbarred galaxies.

- [Power spectrum of halo intrinsic alignments in simulations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.12579)
  - We develop a novel method to measure multipole moments of the three-dimensional power spectrum of the E-mode field of halo shapes with the matter/halo distribution and those of the auto-power spectrum of the E mode based on the E/B-mode decomposition.
  - The IA power spectra have non-vanishing amplitudes over the linear to nonlinear scales, and the large-scale amplitudes at k≲0.1 h Mpc−1 are related to the matter power spectrum via a constant coefficient (AIA), similar to the linear bias parameter.
  - The IA power spectra exhibit baryon acoustic oscillations, and vary with halo samples of different masses, redshifts and cosmological parameters (Ωm,S8).
  - Our results demonstrate that the IA power spectra of galaxy shapes, measured from imaging and spectroscopic surveys for an overlapping area of the sky, can be powerful tools to probe the underlying matter power spectrum, the primordial curvature perturbations, and cosmological parameters, in addition to the standard galaxy density power spectrum.

- [On the importance of lensing for galaxy clustering in photometric and spectroscopic surveys](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.12981)
  - 在进行星系计数研究时不能忽略lensing的影响：For a spectroscopic survey like SKA2, we find that neglecting lensing in the monopole, quadrupole and hexadecapole of the correlation function also induces an important shift of parameters.
  - On the other hand, for a survey like DESI, we find that lensing is not important, mainly due to the value of the magnification bias parameter of DESI, s(z), which strongly reduces the lensing contribution at high redshift.

  - 看这些参数的误差对于SPS模型有多大影响：We conclude that the effects of uncertainty in the empirical binary parameter distributions are likely smaller than those introduced by metallicity and stellar population age uncertainties for observational data.

- [GASP XXVII: Gas-phase metallicity scaling relations in disk galaxies with and without ram-pressure stripping](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.11917)
  - We study the gas-phase metallicity scaling relations of a sample of 29 cluster galaxies undergoing ram-pressure stripping and of a reference sample of (16 cluster and 16 field) galaxies with no significant signs of gas disturbance.
  - At any given mass, reference cluster and stripping galaxies have similar metallicities, while the field galaxies with M⋆<10^10.25M⊙ show on average lower gas metallicity than galaxies in clusters.
  - At the effective radius the chemical properties of the stripping galaxies are independent of the ram-pressure stripping mechanism

- [Ram pressure stripping candidates in the Coma Cluster: Evidence for enhanced star formation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.12033)

  - Color-color distributions suggest a mixture of PAHs and highly-extincted photospheric emission from young stars. The average V-band extinction is ~20 mag, equally divided between foreground and core.
  - The extinction and stellar mass suggest an intrinsic core diameter of ~18 pc for 5% star formation efficiency

  - The primary ∼264 million sources have either or both of the Gaia and SDSS astrometry, with a typical precision of 2.0-5.0 masyr.
  - The secondary ∼136 million sources only have PS1 astrometry, the average precision is worse than 15.0 masyr.

  - Predicts consistent lensing-induced smoothing of acoustic peaks within ΛCDM cosmology and yields the robust predictions of the cosmological parameters: S8值接近lensing constraint
  - It also raises up the Hubble constant H0=69.7±1kms−1Mpc−1 that reduces the Hubble tension to the 2.5σ level.
  - We found that EDE completely alleviates the Hubble tension and significantly improves the goodness-of-fit by 2.9σ in comparison with the concordance ΛCDM model.

- [Does jackknife scale really matter for accurate large-scale structure covariances?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.13436)
  - We find that it is useful to apply the tapering scheme to estimate the precision matrix from a limited number of jackknife resamplings.
  - The results from CMASS and mock catalogues show that the error estimate of the baryon acoustic scale does not depend on the jackknife scale.
  - However, when relatively few resamplings are used, the jackknife error estimate becomes unreliable.

- [The GLEAM 4-Jy (G4Jy) Sample: II. Host-galaxy identification for individual sources](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.13025)
  - MWA南天巡天：We refer to these 1,863 sources as the GLEAM 4-Jy (G4Jy) Sample, and use radio images (of ≤ 45-arcsec resolution), and multi-wavelength information, to assess their morphology and identify the galaxy that is hosting the radio emission
  - Whilst the vast majority of the G4Jy Sample are active galactic nuclei with powerful radio-jets, we highlight that it also contains a nebula, two nearby, star-forming galaxies, a cluster relic, and a cluster halo.

- [Evolution and Role of Mergers in the BCG-Cluster Alignment. A View from Cosmological Hydro-Simulations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.13038)
  - **Relevant**
  - At redshift z=0, the major axes of the simulated BCGs and their host cluster galaxy distributions are aligned on average within 20 degree.
  - The BCG alignment with the DM halo is even tighter. The alignment persists up to z≲2 with no evident evolution.
  - 但投影效应使得alignment减弱；These results taken together might imply that the BCG-Cluster alignment occurs in an outside-in fashion. Depending on their frequency and geometry, mergers can promote, destroy or weaken the alignments.

- [The stellar halos of ETGs in the IllustrisTNG simulations: the photometric and kinematic diversity of galaxies at large radii](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.13042)
  - **Relevant**
  - We find that the simulated galaxy sample reproduces the diversity of kinematic properties observed in ETG halos.
  - Simulated fast rotators (FRs) divide almost evenly in one third having flat lambda profiles and high halo rotational support, a third with gently decreasing profiles, and another third with low halo rotation. Slow rotators (SRs) tend to have increased rotation in the outskirts
  - Rotational support and shape are deeply related: the kinematic transition to lower rotational support is accompanied by a change towards rounder intrinsic shape.

- [The Most Predictive Physical Properties for Stellar Population Radial Profiles of Nearby Galaxies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.13044)
  - 利用MaNGA数据：We find that M⋆ is the single most predictive physical property for ∇D4000 and ∇[Z/H]L.
  - 环境参数，central v.s. sat对星族参数梯度影响不大：∇ D4000 of star-forming satellite galaxies with M⋆≲10^10M⊙ exhibit a significant positive correlation with galaxy overdensities
  - Galaxies with lower sSFR have on average steeper negative stellar population gradients, and this sSFR dependence is stronger for more massive star-forming galaxies.

  - D<25 Mpc的24个有GC研究的ETG的LMXB XLF研究；We find that our field LMXB XLF models require a component that scales with SN, and has a shape consistent with that found for the GC LMXB XLF. 言下之意是很多LMXB来自GC
  - We also find that an important LMXB XLF component is required for all galaxies that scales with stellar mass, implying that a substantial population of LMXBs are formed "in situ," which dominates the LMXB population emission for galaxies with SN < 2.

- [Molecular scale height in spiral galaxies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.13053)
  - We find that the scale heights follow a universal exponential law with a scale length of 0.46±0.01 r25. The molecular scale heights in our sample galaxies are found to vary between 50-200 pc depending on the galaxy and radius.

- [Measuring the properties of reionised bubbles with resolved Lyman alpha spectra](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.13065)
  - We demonstrate that spectrally resolved z≳6 Lyman-alpha (Lyα) emission can constrain properties of reionised regions. Specifically, the distant from a source to a neutral region sets the minimum observable Lyα velocity offset from systemic.
  - 在Lya蓝端探测到流量意味着电离源处于一个已经电离程度比较高的区域，对bubble的size和中性比例都有限制。
  - This optically thin region is typically ≲0.3 pMpc in radius
  - We demonstrate the z≈6.6 galaxy COLA1 - with a blue Lyα peak - likely resides in an ionised region >0.7 pMpc, with residual neutral fraction < 10^-5.5.

  - The Strong ELGs lie ~0.9 dex above the star-forming main-sequence at z~3.5 and have high inferred gas fractions of fgas~>60%
  - Strong [OIII]5007A emission signals an early episode of intense stellar growth in low mass (Mstar<0.1M*) galaxies

  - We present a tool to generate mock quasar microlensing light curves and sample them according to any observing strategy.
  - We conclude that depending on the location on the sky, the lens and source redshift, and the caustic network density, the microlensing variability may deviate significantly than the expected ∼20-year average time scale

  - We present a catalog of 281 edge-on LSBG candidates, which are selected from the cross-match between SDSS DR7 and the 40% ALFALFA catalog.
  - Our result suggests that the correction of inclination effects is very important for obtaining a complete sample of LSBGs.

- [SCUBA-2 Ultra Deep Imaging EAO Survey (STUDIES) IV: Spatial clustering and halo masses of 450-μm-selected sub-millimeter galaxies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.13616)
  - We select a robust (signal-to-noise ratio ⩾4) and flux-limited (⩾4\,mJy) sample of 164 450-μm-selected sub-millimeter galaxies (SMGs) that have K-band counterparts
  - We develop a machine-learning classifier using K-band magnitude and color-color pairs based on the thirteen-band photometry available in this field
  - We apply the trained machine-learning classifier to the wider COSMOS field (1.6 deg2) using the same COSMOS2015 catalog and identify a sample of 6182 450-μm SMG candidates with similar colors.
  - We find that the 450-μm SMG candidates reside in halos with masses of ≃(2.0±0.5)×10^13h−1M⊙ across this redshift range.

- [Simulations of gas sloshing induced by a newly discovered gas poor substructure in galaxy cluster Abell 1644](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.13660)
  - At this instant A1644N2 is gas poor, becoming nearly undetectable in X-ray emission.
  - We find that the more likely scenario is a collision between A1644S and the newly discovered A1644N2, where A1644N1 may be present as long as it does not greatly interfere in the formation of the spiral feature.

- [Revising the merger scenario of the galaxy cluster Abell 1644: a new gas poor structure discovered by weak gravitational lensing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.13662)
  - The lensing and galaxy density maps showed a structure in the North that could not be seen on the X-ray images. We, therefore, rename the previously known northern halo as A1644N1 and the new one as A1644N2.
  - We propose a scenario where the remarkable X-ray characteristics in the system are the result of a collision between A1644S and A1644N2 that happened ∼1.6 Gyr ago.

- [Concentrations of Dark Haloes Emerge from Their Merger Histories](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.13732)
  - **Relevant**
  - Dark Sky, a suite of cosmological N-body simulations
  - We show that the evolution of halo concentration has two primary modes: (1) smooth increase due to pseudo-evolution; and (2) intense responses to physical merger events
  - We argue that merger events are a major contributor to the uncertainty in halo concentration at fixed halo mass and formation time. 即便是minor merger，也可能会引起对pseudo-evolution的偏离
  - Hence, caution should be taken when using present-day halo concentration parameter as a proxy for the halo assembly history, especially if the recent merger history is unknown.

- [The ALPINE-ALMA [CII] Survey: CGM pollution and gas mixing by tidal stripping in a merging system at z~4.57](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.13737)
  - We find that the system is composed of two massive (Mstar >~ 10^10 Msun) star-forming galaxies experiencing a major merger (stellar mass ratio r_mass ~ 0.9)
  - ALMA reveals also the presence of [CII] emission arising from a circumgalactic gas structure, extending out to ~30 kpc. Our morpho-spectral decomposition analysis shows that about 50% of the total flux resides between the individual galaxy components, in a metal-enriched gaseous envelope characterized by a disturbed morphology and complex kinematics.
  - Our findings suggest that mergers could be an efficient mechanism of gas mixing in the circumgalactic medium around high-z galaxies, and thus play a key role in the galaxy baryon cycle at early epochs.

- [The bivariate gas-stellar mass distributions and the mass functions of early- and late-type galaxies at z∼0](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.13740)
  - **Useful**
  - We report the bivariate HI- and H2-stellar mass distributions of local galaxies in addition of an inventory of galaxy mass functions, MFs, for HI, H2, cold gas, and baryonic mass, separately into early- and late-type galaxies.
  - The MFs are determined using the HI and H2 conditional distributionsand the galaxy stellar mass function, GSMF.
  - The obtained HI MFs agree with radio blind surveys. Similarly, the H2 MFs are consistent with CO follow-up optically-selected samples.
  - Baryons locked inside galaxies represent 5.4% of the universal baryon content, while ∼96% of the HI and H2 mass inside galaxies reside in late-type morphologies.
  - Our results imply cosmic depletion times of H2 and total neutral H in late-type galaxies of ∼1.3 and 7.2 Gyr

- [CHANG-ES XXII: Coherent Magnetic Fields in the Halos of Spiral Galaxies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.14383)
  - The magnetic field in spiral galaxies is known to have a large-scale spiral structure along the galactic disk and is observed as X-shaped in the halo of some galaxies.

- [Comparing galaxy formation in the L-GALAXIES semi-analytical model and the IllustrisTNG simulations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.14390)
  - **Interesting**
  - 在TNG tree上运行L-Galaxies做galaxy-to-galaxy的比较：We find that both the stellar mass functions and the stellar masses of individual galaxies agree to better than ∼0.2dex. On the other hand, specific star formation rates and gas contents can differ more substantially.
  - TNG在高红移的quenched fraction更高 (Feedback更强？)；在z=0，SF和quiescent星系的质量差别在TNG中更低
  - IllustrisTNG predicts lower baryon fractions in group environments
  - The gas content and star formation rates of galaxies in and around clusters and groups differ substantially, with IllustrisTNG satellites less star-forming and less gas-rich

- [Robust HI kinematics of gas-rich ultra-diffuse galaxies: hints of a weak-feedback formation scenario](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.14392)
  - **Relevant**
  - We show that the HI in our UDGs is distributed in "thin" regularly rotating discs and we determine their rotation velocity and gas velocity dispersion
  - 这些星系偏离BTFR：We find a previously unknown trend between the deviation from the BTFR and the disc scale length valid for dwarf galaxies with circular speeds < 45 km/s, with our UDGs being at the extreme end.
  - We suggest that the high baryon fractions of our UDGs may originate due to the fact that they have experienced weak stellar feedback, likely due to their low star formation rate surface densities
  - We find indications that our UDGs may have higher-than-average stellar specific angular momentum, which can explain their large optical sizes.

- [Figuring Out Gas & Galaxies In Enzo (FOGGIE). IV. The Stochasticity of Ram Pressure Stripping in Galactic Halos](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.14394)
  - The CGM of each halo spans a wide dynamic range in density and velocity over its volume---roughly 6 dex and 1000 km/s, respectively---translating into a 5 dex range in ram pressure imparted to interacting satellites.
  - CGM中的RP分布非常随机，经常有kpc尺度的密度和温度变化产生的；RPS过程也强烈依赖于卫星的具体轨道，很难预测
  - The cumulative impact of ram pressure on the simulated satellites is dominated by only a few short strong impulses---on average, 90% of the total surface momentum gained through ram pressure is imparted in 20% or less of the total orbital time. 不能用一个平滑的过程描述

- [Lyman-alpha transmission properties of the intergalactic medium in the CoDaII simulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.14496)
  - We use the CoDaII simulation, which is a radiation hydrodynamic simulation featuring a box of ∼94 comoving Mpc side length, to compute the Lyα transmission properties of the intergalactic medium (IGM) at z∼5.8 to 7
  - We find a declining Lyα transmission with redshift and a large sightline-to-sightline variation.
  - We also analyze the IGM transmission on the blue side, which shows a rapid decline at z≳6 of the blue transmission. This low transmission can be attributed not only to the presence of neutral regions but also to the residual neutral hydrogen within ionized regions
