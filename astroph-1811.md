#### [The Sloan Digital Sky Survey Reverberation Mapping Project: Systematic Investigations of Short-Timescale CIV Broad Absorption Line Variability](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.00010)
    * investigate short-timescale (<10-day rest-frame) C iv broad absorption-line (BAL)
variability to constrain quasar-wind properties
    * These frequencies (50%) indicate that such variability is common among quasars and BALs
    * We also examine a variety of spectral characteristics and find that in some cases, BAL variability is best described by ionization-state changes, while other cases are more consistent with changes in covering fraction or column density.


#### [Roll of the Dice: A Stochastically Sampled IMF Alters the StellarContent of Simulated Dwarf Galaxies](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.00022)
    * We implement a self-consistent, stochastically populated IMF in cosmological hydrodynamic simulations
    * We find that a stochastic IMF in simulations makes feedback burstier, strengthening feed- back, and quenching star formation earlier in small dwarf galaxies.
    * For galaxies in halos with mass <10^8.5 M⊙, a stochastic IMF typically leads to lower stellar mass compared to a continuous IMF


#### [ZFOURGE: Extreme 5007Å emission may be a common early-lifetime phase for star-forming galaxies at z>2.5](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.00025)
    - **Interesting**
    * we analyze the properties of 19 Extreme Emission Line Galaxies (EELGs) identified in the bluest composite SED in the zfourge survey at 2.5 ≤ z ≤ 4.
    * Non-parametric SFH by prospector: The EELGs show evidence for a starburst in the most recent 50 Myr
    * We find that virtually all of our EELGs have rising SFHs, while most of our SFGs do not.
    * we hypothesize that many, if not most, star-forming galaxies at z ≥ 2.5 undergo an extreme Hβ+[Oiii] emission line phase early in their lifetimes.


#### [The Stellar Contents of Intermediate Mass Disk Galaxies in the Virgo Cluster. I. GMOS Spectra](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.00041)
    * Characteristic ages and metallicities are found by making comparisons with the strengths of lines measured from model spectra.
    * Rather, the central regions of four galaxies (NGC 4305, NGC 4306, NGC 4497, and NGC 4620) are dominated by populations with ages ∼ 1.5 − 3 Gyr.
    * The disks of these galaxies are dominated by populations that are at least 1 Gyr older than those near the centers, indicating that the quenching of star formation progressed from large radii inwards, and did not occur over a short timescale.


#### [Towards an informed quest for accretion disc winds in quasars: the intriguing case of Ton 28](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.00012)
    * Report on the detection of a blueshifted Fe K absorption feature in two consecutive XMM–Newton observations of the luminous blue quasar
    * The rest energy of 9.2 keV implies the presence of an accretion disc wind with bulk outflow velocity of ∼0.28c
    * Other peculiar optical/UV emissionline properties include narrow Hβ, strong Feii and blueshifted Civ. These are key parameters in the Eigenvector 1 formalism, and are frequently found in active galaxies with ongoing accretion disc winds
