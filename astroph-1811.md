## Nov 2:

#### [The Sloan Digital Sky Survey Reverberation Mapping Project: Systematic Investigations of Short-Timescale CIV Broad Absorption Line Variability](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.00010)
    * investigate short-timescale (<10-day rest-frame) C iv broad absorption-line (BAL)
variability to constrain quasar-wind properties
    * These frequencies (50%) indicate that such variability is common among quasars and BALs
    * We also examine a variety of spectral characteristics and find that in some cases, BAL variability is best described by ionization-state changes, while other cases are more consistent with changes in covering fraction or column density.


#### [Roll of the Dice: A Stochastically Sampled IMF Alters the StellarContent of Simulated Dwarf Galaxies](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.00022)
    * We implement a self-consistent, stochastically populated IMF in cosmological hydrodynamic simulations
    * We find that a stochastic IMF in simulations makes feedback burstier, strengthening feed- back, and quenching star formation earlier in small dwarf galaxies.
    * For galaxies in halos with mass <10^8.5 M⊙, a stochastic IMF typically leads to lower stellar mass compared to a continuous IMF


#### [ZFOURGE: Extreme 5007Å emission may be a common early-lifetime phase for star-forming galaxies at z>2.5](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.00025)
    - **Interesting**
    * we analyze the properties of 19 Extreme Emission Line Galaxies (EELGs) identified in the bluest composite SED in the zfourge survey at 2.5 ≤ z ≤ 4.
    * Non-parametric SFH by prospector: The EELGs show evidence for a starburst in the most recent 50 Myr
    * We find that virtually all of our EELGs have rising SFHs, while most of our SFGs do not.
    * we hypothesize that many, if not most, star-forming galaxies at z ≥ 2.5 undergo an extreme Hβ+[Oiii] emission line phase early in their lifetimes.


#### [The Stellar Contents of Intermediate Mass Disk Galaxies in the Virgo Cluster. I. GMOS Spectra](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.00041)
    * Characteristic ages and metallicities are found by making comparisons with the strengths of lines measured from model spectra.
    * Rather, the central regions of four galaxies (NGC 4305, NGC 4306, NGC 4497, and NGC 4620) are dominated by populations with ages ∼ 1.5 − 3 Gyr.
    * The disks of these galaxies are dominated by populations that are at least 1 Gyr older than those near the centers, indicating that the quenching of star formation progressed from large radii inwards, and did not occur over a short timescale.


#### [Towards an informed quest for accretion disc winds in quasars: the intriguing case of Ton 28](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.00012)
    * Report on the detection of a blueshifted Fe K absorption feature in two consecutive XMM–Newton observations of the luminous blue quasar
    * The rest energy of 9.2 keV implies the presence of an accretion disc wind with bulk outflow velocity of ∼0.28c
    * Other peculiar optical/UV emissionline properties include narrow Hβ, strong Feii and blueshifted Civ. These are key parameters in the Eigenvector 1 formalism, and are frequently found in active galaxies with ongoing accretion disc winds

## Nov 4:

#### [A constant characteristic volume density of dark matter haloes from SPARC rotation curve fits](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.00553)
    * DM和disk星系盘的关系：We explore two cosmologically motivated DM halo profiles: the Einasto profile from DM-only simulations and the DC14 profile from hydrodynamic simulations.
    * We find that the characteristic volume density ρs of DM haloes is nearly constant over ∼5 decades in galaxy luminosity.
    * The scale radius rs and the characteristic surface density ρs · rs, instead, correlate with galaxy luminosity.


#### [The clustering of typical Lyα emitters from z∼2.5−6: host halo masses depend on Lyα and UV luminosities](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.00556)
    * We investigate the clustering and halo properties of ∼ 5000 Lyα-selected emission line galaxies (LAEs) from the Slicing COSMOS 4K (SC4K)
    * We measure clustering lengths of r0 ∼ 3 − 6 h−1 Mpc and typical halo masses of ∼ 10^11 M⊙ for our narrowband-selected LAEs
    * We find a strong, redshift-independent correlation between halo mass and Lyα luminosity normalized by the characteristic Lyα luminosity
    * Our results reveal that LAEs are the likely progenitors of a wide range of galaxies depending on their luminosity, from dwarf-like, to Milky Way-type, to bright cluster galaxies.


#### [GASP XIII. Star formation in gas outside galaxies](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.00823)
    * RPS气体：We demonstrate that the dominating ionization mechanism of this gas (between 64% and 94% of the Hα emission in the tails depending on the diagnostic diagram used) is photoion- ization by young massive stars due to ongoing star formation (SF) taking place in the stripped tails.
    * The tail clumps follow scaling relations (Mgas − M∗, LHα − σ, SFR-Mgas) similar to disk clumps, and their stellar masses are comparable to Ultra Compact Dwarfs and Globular Clusters.
    * The diffuse gas component in the tails is ionized by a combination of SF and composite/LINER-like emission likely due to thermal conduction or turbulence.


#### [ALMA observations of molecular tori around massive black holes](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.00984)
    * We report Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) observations of CO(3-2) emission in a sample of 7 Seyfert/LINER galaxies at the unprecedented spatial resolution


#### [Constraining the Mass Density of Free-Floating Black Holes using Razor-thin Lensing Arcs](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.00637)
    - **Interesting**
    * Strong lensing of AGNs in the radio can result in razor-thin arcs, with a thickness of less than a milli-arcsecond
    * Such razor-thin arcs provide a unique window on the coarseness of the matter distribution between source and observer
    * When sufficiently close to the line-of-sight, free-floating black holes cause kink-like distortions in the arcs, which are detectable by eye in the VLBI images as long as the black hole mass exceeds ∼ 1000 Solar masses.
    * we analytically compute constraints on the matter density of free-floating black holes resulting from null-detections of distortions along a realistic, fiducial arc, and find them to be comparable to those from quasar milli-lensing.

#### [Observational determination of the galaxy bias from cosmic variance with a random pointing survey: Clustering of z~2 galaxies from Hubble's BoRG survey](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.03265)
    * Gravitational clustering broadens the count-in-cells distribution of galaxies for surveys along uncorrelated (well-separated) lines of sight beyond Poisson noise.
    * measure this excess “cosmic” variance to constrain the galaxy bias --> 独立于2PCF的限制
    * we present an observational application of these methods using data from 141 uncorrelated fields, We detect a clear excess in the variance of the galaxy number counts distribution compared to Poisson expectations, from which we estimate a galaxy bias b ≈ 3.63 ± 0.57.
    * demonstrate that with N 􏰂 100 sight-lines, each containing N 􏰂 5 objects, the counts-in-cell analysis provides a robust measurement of the bias

    * We train two ensembles of neural networks on training sets consisting of simulated lenses, simulated non-lenses, and real sources.
    *  During visual inspection we rate 84 as "probably" or "definitely" lenses. Four of these are previously known lenses or lens candidates


#### [Inner bars also buckle. The MUSE TIMER view of the double-barred galaxy NGC 1291](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.03855)
    * We report on the discovery of the first Box-Peanut (B/P) structure in an inner bar detected in the face-on galaxy NGC 1291.
    * The B/P structure is detected as bi-symmetric minima of the h4 moment of the line-of-sight velocity distribution along the major axis of the inner bar, as expected from numerical simulations.
    * They also suggest that inner bars are long-lived structures, thus imposing tight constraints to their possible formation mechanisms.


#### [Initial Mass Function Variations Cannot Explain the Ionizing Spectrum of Low Metallicity Starbursts](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.03856)
    - **Interesting, Relevant**
    * We find that while the flux capable of ionizing hydrogen is only weakly dependent on IMF parameters, the photon flux responsible for the He II and O VI lines is far more sensitive to assumptions.
    * In our current models this flux arises primarily from helium and Wolf-Rayet stars which have partially or fully lost their hydrogen envelopes.
    * Even the most extreme IMFs cannot reproduce the He II ionizing flux observed in some high redshift galaxies, suggesting a source other than stellar photospheres.


#### [Powerful mechanical-driven outflows in the central parsecs of the Low-Luminosity Active Galactic Nucleus ESO428-G14](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.03985)
    * This work reports on the jet-driven mechanical energy and the corresponding mass outflow deposited by the jet in the central 170 parsecs of the nearby LLAGN ESO 428-G14.
    * The jet kinetic output is traced through the coronal line [Si vi] at 19641 Angstrom.
    * From the energetics of the ionized gas it is found that the mass outflow rate of the coronal gas is in the range from 3−8 Msun/yr


#### [CHANG-ES XII: A LOFAR and VLA view of the edge-on star-forming galay NGC 3556](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.04015)
    * We find that the spectral index in the galactic midplane is, as expected for young CRe, α ≈ −0.7 and steepens towards the halo of the galaxy as a consequence of spectral ageing.
    * While pure diffusion cannot explain our data, advection can, particularly if we assume a linearly accelerating wind.


#### [Detecting Radio-AGN signatures in Red geysers](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.04072)
    * We compare the nuclear radio activity of the red geysers to a matched control sample with similar stellar mass, redshift, rest frame NUV − r color, axis ratio and presence of ionized gas.
    * In addition to a 3 times higher FIRST detection rate, we find that red geysers have a 5σ higher level of average radio flux than control galaxies.
    * Red geysers and a possibly-related class with disturbed Hα emission account for 40% of all radio-detected red galaxies with log (M⋆/M⊙) < 11.
    * Our results support a picture in which episodic AGN activity drives large-scale-relatively weak ionized winds that may provide a feedback mechanism for many early-type galaxies.
