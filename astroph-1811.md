#### [The Sloan Digital Sky Survey Reverberation Mapping Project: Systematic Investigations of Short-Timescale CIV Broad Absorption Line Variability](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.00010)
    * investigate short-timescale (<10-day rest-frame) C iv broad absorption-line (BAL)
variability to constrain quasar-wind properties
    * These frequencies (50%) indicate that such variability is common among quasars and BALs
    * We also examine a variety of spectral characteristics and find that in some cases, BAL variability is best described by ionization-state changes, while other cases are more consistent with changes in covering fraction or column density.


#### [Roll of the Dice: A Stochastically Sampled IMF Alters the StellarContent of Simulated Dwarf Galaxies](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.00022)
    * We implement a self-consistent, stochastically populated IMF in cosmological hydrodynamic simulations
    * We find that a stochastic IMF in simulations makes feedback burstier, strengthening feed- back, and quenching star formation earlier in small dwarf galaxies.
    * For galaxies in halos with mass <10^8.5 M⊙, a stochastic IMF typically leads to lower stellar mass compared to a continuous IMF


#### [ZFOURGE: Extreme 5007Å emission may be a common early-lifetime phase for star-forming galaxies at z>2.5](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.00025)
    - **Interesting**
    * we analyze the properties of 19 Extreme Emission Line Galaxies (EELGs) identified in the bluest composite SED in the zfourge survey at 2.5 ≤ z ≤ 4.
    * Non-parametric SFH by prospector: The EELGs show evidence for a starburst in the most recent 50 Myr
    * We find that virtually all of our EELGs have rising SFHs, while most of our SFGs do not.
    * we hypothesize that many, if not most, star-forming galaxies at z ≥ 2.5 undergo an extreme Hβ+[Oiii] emission line phase early in their lifetimes.


#### [The Stellar Contents of Intermediate Mass Disk Galaxies in the Virgo Cluster. I. GMOS Spectra](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.00041)
    * Characteristic ages and metallicities are found by making comparisons with the strengths of lines measured from model spectra.
    * Rather, the central regions of four galaxies (NGC 4305, NGC 4306, NGC 4497, and NGC 4620) are dominated by populations with ages ∼ 1.5 − 3 Gyr.
    * The disks of these galaxies are dominated by populations that are at least 1 Gyr older than those near the centers, indicating that the quenching of star formation progressed from large radii inwards, and did not occur over a short timescale.


#### [Towards an informed quest for accretion disc winds in quasars: the intriguing case of Ton 28](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.00012)
    * Report on the detection of a blueshifted Fe K absorption feature in two consecutive XMM–Newton observations of the luminous blue quasar
    * The rest energy of 9.2 keV implies the presence of an accretion disc wind with bulk outflow velocity of ∼0.28c
    * Other peculiar optical/UV emissionline properties include narrow Hβ, strong Feii and blueshifted Civ. These are key parameters in the Eigenvector 1 formalism, and are frequently found in active galaxies with ongoing accretion disc winds

## Nov 4:

#### [A constant characteristic volume density of dark matter haloes from SPARC rotation curve fits](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.00553)
    * DM和disk星系盘的关系：We explore two cosmologically motivated DM halo profiles: the Einasto profile from DM-only simulations and the DC14 profile from hydrodynamic simulations.
    * We find that the characteristic volume density ρs of DM haloes is nearly constant over ∼5 decades in galaxy luminosity.
    * The scale radius rs and the characteristic surface density ρs · rs, instead, correlate with galaxy luminosity.


#### [The clustering of typical Lyα emitters from z∼2.5−6: host halo masses depend on Lyα and UV luminosities](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.00556)
    * We investigate the clustering and halo properties of ∼ 5000 Lyα-selected emission line galaxies (LAEs) from the Slicing COSMOS 4K (SC4K)
    * We measure clustering lengths of r0 ∼ 3 − 6 h−1 Mpc and typical halo masses of ∼ 10^11 M⊙ for our narrowband-selected LAEs
    * We find a strong, redshift-independent correlation between halo mass and Lyα luminosity normalized by the characteristic Lyα luminosity
    * Our results reveal that LAEs are the likely progenitors of a wide range of galaxies depending on their luminosity, from dwarf-like, to Milky Way-type, to bright cluster galaxies.


#### [GASP XIII. Star formation in gas outside galaxies](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.00823)
    * RPS气体：We demonstrate that the dominating ionization mechanism of this gas (between 64% and 94% of the Hα emission in the tails depending on the diagnostic diagram used) is photoion- ization by young massive stars due to ongoing star formation (SF) taking place in the stripped tails.
    * The tail clumps follow scaling relations (Mgas − M∗, LHα − σ, SFR-Mgas) similar to disk clumps, and their stellar masses are comparable to Ultra Compact Dwarfs and Globular Clusters.
    * The diffuse gas component in the tails is ionized by a combination of SF and composite/LINER-like emission likely due to thermal conduction or turbulence.


#### [ALMA observations of molecular tori around massive black holes](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.00984)
    * We report Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) observations of CO(3-2) emission in a sample of 7 Seyfert/LINER galaxies at the unprecedented spatial resolution


#### [Constraining the Mass Density of Free-Floating Black Holes using Razor-thin Lensing Arcs](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.00637)
    - **Interesting**
    * Strong lensing of AGNs in the radio can result in razor-thin arcs, with a thickness of less than a milli-arcsecond
    * Such razor-thin arcs provide a unique window on the coarseness of the matter distribution between source and observer
    * When sufficiently close to the line-of-sight, free-floating black holes cause kink-like distortions in the arcs, which are detectable by eye in the VLBI images as long as the black hole mass exceeds ∼ 1000 Solar masses.
    * we analytically compute constraints on the matter density of free-floating black holes resulting from null-detections of distortions along a realistic, fiducial arc, and find them to be comparable to those from quasar milli-lensing.

#### [Observational determination of the galaxy bias from cosmic variance with a random pointing survey: Clustering of z~2 galaxies from Hubble's BoRG survey](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.03265)
    * Gravitational clustering broadens the count-in-cells distribution of galaxies for surveys along uncorrelated (well-separated) lines of sight beyond Poisson noise.
    * measure this excess “cosmic” variance to constrain the galaxy bias --> 独立于2PCF的限制
    * we present an observational application of these methods using data from 141 uncorrelated fields, We detect a clear excess in the variance of the galaxy number counts distribution compared to Poisson expectations, from which we estimate a galaxy bias b ≈ 3.63 ± 0.57.
    * demonstrate that with N 􏰂 100 sight-lines, each containing N 􏰂 5 objects, the counts-in-cell analysis provides a robust measurement of the bias

    * We train two ensembles of neural networks on training sets consisting of simulated lenses, simulated non-lenses, and real sources.
    *  During visual inspection we rate 84 as "probably" or "definitely" lenses. Four of these are previously known lenses or lens candidates


#### [Inner bars also buckle. The MUSE TIMER view of the double-barred galaxy NGC 1291](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.03855)
    * We report on the discovery of the first Box-Peanut (B/P) structure in an inner bar detected in the face-on galaxy NGC 1291.
    * The B/P structure is detected as bi-symmetric minima of the h4 moment of the line-of-sight velocity distribution along the major axis of the inner bar, as expected from numerical simulations.
    * They also suggest that inner bars are long-lived structures, thus imposing tight constraints to their possible formation mechanisms.


#### [Initial Mass Function Variations Cannot Explain the Ionizing Spectrum of Low Metallicity Starbursts](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.03856)
    - **Interesting, Relevant**
    * We find that while the flux capable of ionizing hydrogen is only weakly dependent on IMF parameters, the photon flux responsible for the He II and O VI lines is far more sensitive to assumptions.
    * In our current models this flux arises primarily from helium and Wolf-Rayet stars which have partially or fully lost their hydrogen envelopes.
    * Even the most extreme IMFs cannot reproduce the He II ionizing flux observed in some high redshift galaxies, suggesting a source other than stellar photospheres.


#### [Powerful mechanical-driven outflows in the central parsecs of the Low-Luminosity Active Galactic Nucleus ESO428-G14](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.03985)
    * This work reports on the jet-driven mechanical energy and the corresponding mass outflow deposited by the jet in the central 170 parsecs of the nearby LLAGN ESO 428-G14.
    * The jet kinetic output is traced through the coronal line [Si vi] at 19641 Angstrom.
    * From the energetics of the ionized gas it is found that the mass outflow rate of the coronal gas is in the range from 3−8 Msun/yr


#### [CHANG-ES XII: A LOFAR and VLA view of the edge-on star-forming galay NGC 3556](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.04015)
    * We find that the spectral index in the galactic midplane is, as expected for young CRe, α ≈ −0.7 and steepens towards the halo of the galaxy as a consequence of spectral ageing.
    * While pure diffusion cannot explain our data, advection can, particularly if we assume a linearly accelerating wind.


#### [Detecting Radio-AGN signatures in Red geysers](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.04072)
    * We compare the nuclear radio activity of the red geysers to a matched control sample with similar stellar mass, redshift, rest frame NUV − r color, axis ratio and presence of ionized gas.
    * In addition to a 3 times higher FIRST detection rate, we find that red geysers have a 5σ higher level of average radio flux than control galaxies.
    * Red geysers and a possibly-related class with disturbed Hα emission account for 40% of all radio-detected red galaxies with log (M⋆/M⊙) < 11.
    * Our results support a picture in which episodic AGN activity drives large-scale-relatively weak ionized winds that may provide a feedback mechanism for many early-type galaxies.

    * Kinematics derived from near-IR and optical data from the SINFONI and MUSE IFUs on the VLT reveal AGN-driven outflows powered by a super-massive black hole
    * The symmetric bicone outflows show rapid acceleration to ±250 km s−1
    * Over the AGN active lifetime of ∼10^7 years, 1.6 × 108 M⊙ of gas can become gravitationally unbound from the galaxy, a large proportion of the gas mass available for star formation in the nuclear region.


#### [Constraining the three-dimensional orbits of galaxies under ram pressure stripping with convolutional neural networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.04553)
    - **Interesting**
    * For a given density of intracluster medium (ICM) and a given velocity of a disk galaxy, RPS can be controlled by two angles (θ and φ) that define the angular relationship between the direction vector of the galaxy’s three-dimensional (3D) motion within its host cluster and the galaxy’s spin vector
    * We first train a CNN by using ∼ 105 synthesized images of gaseous distributions of the galaxies from numerous RPS models with different θ and φ.
    * This result suggests that if the ICM is in hydrostatic equilibrium (thus not moving), the 3D orbit of a disk galaxy within its host cluster can be constrained by the spatial distribution of the gas being stripped by RPS.

## Nov 11:

#### [Weak lensing analysis of galaxy pairs using CS82 data](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.04940)
    - **Relevant**
    * We determine halo masses for the Total sample of pairs as well as for Interacting, Red and Higher luminosity pair subsamples with ∼ 3σ confidence
    * Derived lensing masses were compared to a proxy of the dynamical mass, obtaining a good correlation. However, there is a large discrepancy between lensing masses and the dynamical mass estimates, which could be accounted by astrophysical processes such as dynamical friction, by the inclusion of unbound pairs, and by significant deviations of the density distribution from a SIS and NFW profiles in the inner regions.


#### [Satellite galaxies in the Illustris-1 simulation: anisotropic locations around relatively isolated hosts](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.04942)
    - **Relevant**
    * As expected from previous studies, the satellites are distributed anisotropically in the plane of the sky, with a preference for being located near the major axes of their hosts.
    * When measured with respect to the hosts’ dark matter surface mass density, the mean satellite location depends strongly on host stellar mass and luminosity, with the satellites of the faintest, least massive hosts showing the greatest anisotropy.
    * The satellite locations are, however, dependent upon the stellar masses of the satellites, with the most massive satellites having the most anisotropic distributions.


#### [HST emission-line images of nearby 3CR radio galaxies: two photoionization, accretion and feedback modes](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.04946)
    * Based on nuclear emission line ratios, we divide the sample into High and Low Excitation Galaxies (HEGs and LEGs). We observe different line morphologies, extended line emission on kpc scale, large [O III]/Hα scatter across the galaxies, and a radio-line alignment.
    * We find evidence of correlations between line luminosities and (radio and X-ray) nuclear luminosities. All these results point to a main common origin, the active nucleus, which ionize the surrounding gas.
    * For LEGs (hot-gas accretors), the synchrotron emission from the jet represents the main source of ionizing photons. The lack of cold gas and star formation in their hosts accounts for the moderate ionized-gas masses and sizes.
    * For HEGs (cold-gas accretors), an ionizing continuum from a standard disk and shocks from the powerful jets are the main sources of photoionization, with the contribution from star formation.


#### [Detection of a Star Forming Galaxy in the Center of a Low-Mass Galaxy Cluster](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.04958)
    - **Interesting, Relevant**
    * In this work, we utilize XMM-Newton X-ray observations of five galaxy clusters to map the morphology of the intracluster medium (ICM), characterize the galaxy clusters, determine the position of the cluster center, and measure the offset between the cluster center and the superluminous disk galaxies.
    * We demonstrate that one superluminous lenticular galaxy, 2MASX J10405643-0103584, resides at the center of a low-mass (M500 = 1014 M⊙) galaxy cluster. This represents the first conclusive evidence that a superluminous disk galaxy is the central BCG of a galaxy cluster.


#### [Ambient Column Densities of Highly Ionized Oxygen in Precipitation-Limited Circumgalactic Media](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.04976)
    * This paper presents predictions for CGM absorption lines (O VI, O VII, O VIII, Ne VIII, N V) that are based on precipitation-regulated feedback models, which posit that the radiative cooling time of the ambient medium cannot drop much below 10 times the freefall time without triggering a strong feedback event.
    * Within the precipitation framework, the strongest O VI absorption lines result from vertical mixing of the CGM that raises low-entropy ambient gas to greater altitudes, because adiabatic cooling of the uplifted gas then lowers its temperature and raises the fractional abundance of O5+


#### [Dark matter stripping in galaxy clusters: a look at the Stellar to Halo Mass relation in the Illustris simulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.04996)
    * We find that subhaloes start losing their dark matter as soon as they reach ∼ 1.5 × Rvir from the centre of their host, and that up to 80% of their dark matter content get stripped during infall.


#### [Direct Detection of Quasar Feedback Via the Sunyaev-Zeldovich Effect](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.05023)
    - **Interesting**
    * The nature and energetics of feedback from thermal winds in quasars can be constrained via observations of the Sunyaev-Zeldovich Effect (SZE) induced by the bubble of thermal plasma blown into the intergalactic medium by the quasar wind.
    * we have made the first detection of such a bubble, associated with the hyperluminous quasar HE 0515-4414
    * Our detection appears on only one side of the quasar, consistent with the SZE signal arising from a combination of thermal and kinetic contributions.


#### [Figuring Out Gas & Galaxies in Enzo (FOGGIE). II. Emission from the z = 3 Circumgalactic Medium](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.05060)
    * We present mock emission- line maps of highly resolved CGM gas from the FOGGIE project
    * By increasing the spatial resolution alone, the total luminosity of the line emission increases by an order of magnitude. This increase arises in the abundance of dense small-scale structure resolved when the CGM gas is simulated to <100 pc scales
    * We conclude that accounting for small-scale structure well below the level of instrument spatial resolution is necessary to properly interpret such observations in terms of the underlying gas structure driving observable emission.


#### [Hierarchical Bayesian approach for estimating physical properties in nearby galaxies: Age Maps (Paper II)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.05273)
    - **Interesting**
    * We present a hierarchical Bayesian model to compute age maps from images in the Hα line (taken with Taurus Tunable Filter, TTF), ultraviolet band (GALEX far UV, FUV), and infrared bands
    * The Hα to FUV flux ratio is a good relative indicator of the very recent star formation history (SFH).
    * We propose a Bayesian hierarchical model where a joint probability distribution is de- fined to determine the parameters (age, metallicity, IMF) from the observed data (the observed flux ratios Hα/FUV).

#### [Dust in and around galaxies: dust in cluster environments and its impact on gas cooling](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.05477)
    - **Interesting** 可以看成是cluster环境下尘埃形成和摧毁的综述
    * Here we present cosmological hydrodynamical simulations of a cluster of galaxies, M200,crit = 6 × 10^14 M⊙, including a novel dust model for the moving mesh code AREPO.
    * Dust production, growth, supernova-shock-driven destruction, ion-collision-driven thermal sputtering, and high temperature dust cooling through far infrared re-radiation of collisionally deposited electron energies.
    * This results in noticeable changes of the entropy, temperature, and density profiles of cluster gas once dust formation is included.
    * We conclude that dust can survive sufficiently long in the intracluster medium to reach a small but significant abundance with implications for the thermodynamic properties of the cluster.


#### [The LoTSS view of radio AGN in the local Universe. The most massive galaxies are always switched on](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.05528)

    * a study of the local radio source population, by cross-comparing the data from the first data release (DR1) of the LOFAR Two-Metre Sky Survey (LoTSS) with the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) DR7 main galaxy spectroscopic sample
    * An improved method to separate active galactic nuclei (AGN) accurately from sources with radio emission powered by star formation (SF) is developed and applied, leading to a sample of 2121 local (z < 0.3) radio AGN.
    * The prevalence of radio AGN activity is confirmed to show a strong dependence on both stellar and black hole masses, remarkably reaching a fraction of 100 per cent of the most massive galaxies (> 10^11M⊙) displaying radio-AGN activity
    * More than 50 per cent of the energy is released during the ≤ 2 per cent of the time spent at the highest accretion rates


#### [AGN Feedback in galaxy groups: a detailed study of X-ray features and diffuse radio emission in IC1262](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.05647)
    * A systematic search of X-ray cavities, density jumps and shocks in the inter-galactic environment of the galaxy group IC 1262 
    * X-ray imaging analysis reveals a pair of X-ray cavities on the north and south of the X-ray peak
    * The X-ray cavity at the position of southern radio lobe probably represents a first generation X-ray cavity. Two surface brightness edges are evident to the west and east−north of the center of this group.


#### [Correlation between SFR surface density and thermal pressure of ionized gas in local analogs of high-redshift galaxies](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.05663)
    - **姜天星**
    * We explore the relation between the star formation rate surface density (ΣSFR) and the interstellar gas pressure for nearby compact starburst galaxies
    * The high gas pressure and the correlation, are in agreement with those found in star-forming galaxies at z ∼ 2.5.
    * These extreme pressures are shown to be responsible for driving galactic winds in nearby starbursts. These outflows may be a crucial in enabling Lyman-α and Lyman-continuum to escape.


#### [Direct Te metallicity calibration of R23 in strong line emitters](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.05796)
    - **姜天星**
    * We report a new empirical calibration of R23 for extreme emission-line galaxies using a large sample of about 800 star-forming green pea galaxies with reliable Te-based gas-phase metallicity measurements.
    * For galaxies with strong emission lines and large ionization parameter (which manifests as log [OIII]λλ4959,5007/[OII]λλ3726,3729 ≥ 0.6), R23 monotonically increases with log(O/H) and the double-value degeneracy is broken. 
    * We also report on 15 galaxies with metallicities less than 1/12 solar, with the lowest metallicities being 12+log(O/H) = 7.25 and 7.26.


#### [Interstellar Medium and Star Formation of Starburst Galaxies on the Merger Sequence](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.05822)
    - 上官晋沂
    * We present a detailed study of the infrared (∼ 1 − 500 μm) spectral energy distributions of a large sample of 193 nearby (z<0.088) luminous infrared galaxies (LIRGs)
    * The radiation field of LIRGs tends to have much higher intensity than in quiescent galaxies, and it increases toward advanced merger stages as a result of central concentration of the interstellar medium and star formation.
    * We find that the gas fraction of LIRGs is on average ∼0.3 dex higher than that of main-sequence star-forming galaxies, rising moderately toward advanced merger stages.

#### [The X-ray Variability of AGN and its Implications for Observations of Galaxy Clusters](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.05786)
    * 用X-ray找星系团会受到点源影响，大多数都是AGN：This can be addressed by combining observations from a high angular resolution observatory (such as Chandra) with deeper data from a more sensitive observatory that may not be able to resolve the AGN (like XMM-Newton). However, this approach is undermined if the AGN varies in flux between the epochs of the observations
    * We find a fractional variability that increases with increasing interval between observations, from about 0.25 for observations separated by tens of days up to about 0.45 for observations separated by ∼ 10 years.
    * given the precise X-ray flux of a typical AGN at one epoch, its flux at a second epoch some years earlier or later can be predicted with a precision of about 60% due to its variability

#### [Inferring a difference in the star-forming properties of lower versus higher X-ray luminosity AGNs](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.05980)
    * when the SFR/SFR_MS distribution of AGN hosts is modelled as a log-normal distribution (i.e. the same shape as that of MS galaxies), galaxies hosting more powerful X-ray AGNs (i.e. LX > 2 × 10^43erg s−1) display a narrower RMS distribution that is shifted to higher values compared to their lower LX counterparts.
    * Our results suggest that the typical star-forming properties of AGN hosts change with LX, and that more powerful AGNs typically reside in more MS-like star-forming galaxies compared to lower LX AGNs.

    * analyse maps of the spatially-resolved nebular emission of ≈1500 star-forming galaxies at z ≈ 0.6–2.2 from deep KMOS and MUSE observations to measure the av- erage shape of their rotation curves.
    *  Normalising in size by the galaxy stellar disk-scale length (Rd), we construct stacked position-velocity diagrams that trace the average galaxy rotation curve out to 6Rd
    * The average rotation curve for galaxies binned in stellar mass, stellar surface mass density and/or redshift is approximately flat, or continues to rise, out to at least 6Rd. 没有下降

#### [The Multiple Merger Assembly of a Hyper-luminous Obscured Quasar at redshift 4.6](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.05992)
    * We report spectroscopic imaging of a multiple merger event in the most luminous known galaxy, WISE J224607.56−052634.9 (W2246−0526), a dust- obscured quasar at redshift 4.6
    * Far-infrared dust continuum observations show three galaxy companions around W2246−0526 with disturbed morphologies, connected by streams of dust likely produced by the dynamical interaction.


#### [The "Fundamental Metallicity Relation" in CALIFA, SDSS-IV MaNGA and high-z galaxies](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.06015)
    * we first discuss the different parametrisations of this M∗-Z- SFR relation that appeared in the literature, to understand the origin of their different shapes.
    * we find that those datasets are instead fully consistent with the FMR predictions, with the expected dependency on SFR at fixed mass.

#### [The Relation Between Galaxy ISM and Circumgalactic OVI Gas Kinematics Derived from Observations and ΛCDM Simulations](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.06028)
    - **Interesting, PrettyFigure**
    * First galaxy–OVI absorption kinematic study for 20 absorption systems (EW>0.1 Å) associated with isolated galaxies (0.15 ≤ z ≤ 0.55) that have accurate redshifts and rotation curves obtained using Keck/ESI.
    * 把absorber按照major axis和minor axis划分：OVI absorption along the galaxy major axis is not correlated with galaxy rotation kinematics, with only 1/10 systems that could be explained with rotation/accretion models. 和MgII符合co-rotation很不一样
    * OVI along the minor axis could be modeled by accelerating outflows but only for small opening angles, while the majority of the OVI is decelerating
    * We conclude that OVI alone does not serve as a useful kinematic indicator of gas accretion, outflows or star-formation and likely best probes the halo virial temperature.

#### [Measurement of the Splashback Feature around SZ-selected Galaxy Clusters with DES, SPT and ACT](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.06081)
    - **Relevant, Important**
    * We present a detection of the splashback feature around galaxy clusters selected using the Sunyaev-Zel’dovich (SZ) signal.
    * The SZ observable used to select clusters in this analysis is expected to have a tighter correlation with halo mass and to be more immune to projection effects and aperture-induced biases, potentially ameliorating causes of systematic error for optically selected clusters.
    * We find that the measured rsp for SZ-selected clusters is consistent with the expectations from simulations, although the small number of SZ-selected clusters makes a precise comparison difficult.
    * when using optically selected redMaPPer clusters with similar mass and redshift distributions, rsp is ∼2σ smaller than in the simulations.
    * blue galaxies have profiles close to a power law with no discernible splashback feature, which is consistent with them being on their first infall into the cluster.
