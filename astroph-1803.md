#### [How galaxies form stars: the connection between local and global star formation in galaxy simulations](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.00007)
    * global depletion times and star-forming gas
mass fractions in simulated galaxies exhibit systematic and well-defined trends as a function of the local star formation efficiency per freefall time, εff, strength of stellar feedback, and star formation threshold


#### [Storm in a Teacup: X-ray view of an obscured quasar and superbubble](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.00009)
    * High resolution Chandra imaging data reveal a ≈ 10 kpc loop of X-ray emission
    * The X-ray emission from this structure is in good agreement with a shocked thermal gas
    * 一个辐射主导的AGN，X-ray光度和bubble的能量之间的关系和radio-mode下的feedback的关系差不多


#### [X-ray scaling relations of early-type galaxies](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.00020)
    - **Relevant**
    * This steepening indicates that their atmospheres are heated above the level expected from gravitational infall alone. Energetic feedback from nuclear black holes and supernova explosions are likely heating agents.
    * Higher stellar velocity dispersions and higher metallicities are found in hotter, brighter, and more massive atmospheres.
