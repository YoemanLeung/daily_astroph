#### [How galaxies form stars: the connection between local and global star formation in galaxy simulations](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.00007)
    * global depletion times and star-forming gas
mass fractions in simulated galaxies exhibit systematic and well-defined trends as a function of the local star formation efficiency per freefall time, εff, strength of stellar feedback, and star formation threshold


#### [Storm in a Teacup: X-ray view of an obscured quasar and superbubble](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.00009)
    * High resolution Chandra imaging data reveal a ≈ 10 kpc loop of X-ray emission
    * The X-ray emission from this structure is in good agreement with a shocked thermal gas
    * 一个辐射主导的AGN，X-ray光度和bubble的能量之间的关系和radio-mode下的feedback的关系差不多


#### [X-ray scaling relations of early-type galaxies](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.00020)
    - **Relevant**
    * This steepening indicates that their atmospheres are heated above the level expected from gravitational infall alone. Energetic feedback from nuclear black holes and supernova explosions are likely heating agents.
    * Higher stellar velocity dispersions and higher metallicities are found in hotter, brighter, and more massive atmospheres.


#### [Field spheroid-dominated galaxies in a Λ-CDM Universe](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.00034)
    * However, the simulated galaxies are bluer and with higher star formation rates than observed isolated early-type galaxies.


#### [The OIII profiles of infrared-selected active galactic nuclei: More powerful outflows in the obscured population](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.00083)
    * The IR-selected obscured sources contain a mixture of narrow-lined Type 2 AGN and intermediate sources that have broad Hα emission and significantly narrower Hβ
    * In matched bins of luminosity we find that the obscured population typically has broader, more blueshifted [Oiii] emission than in the unobscured sample, suggestive of more powerful AGN- driven outflows.
    * geometric unification models 不足以解释红外AGN需要在obscured和unobscured之间有演化


#### [Intermediate line emission in AGN: the effect of gas density prescription](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.00090)
    * We found that the low ionization iron line, Fe II, appears to be highly sensitive for the presence of dust and therefore becomes potential tracer of dust content in line emitting regions.


#### [GOODS-ALMA: 1.1 mm galaxy survey - I. Source catalogue and optically dark galaxies](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.00157)
    * 69平方角分，0.60" beam; 20 sources brighter than 0.7 mJy
    * Our sample includes 20% HST –dark galaxies (4 out of 20), 都有红外探测
    * At least 40% of the ALMA sources host an X-ray AGN, compared to ∼14% for other galaxies of similar mass and redshift.

    * AGN-dominated DOG


#### [Molecular gas reservoirs in cluster galaxies at z=1.46](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.00298)
    - **Relevant, Interesting**
    * We detect dust continuum emission at 870 μm and CO J = 2–1 emission line from 8 and 17 member galaxies respectively within a cluster-centric radius of R200.
    * the fraction of molecular gas mass and the depletion time scale for the cluster galaxies are larger than expected from the scaling relations of molecular gas on stellar mass and offset from the main sequence of star-forming galaxies in general fields.
    * Therefore, the massive galaxies in the cluster core quench the star formation activity while consuming most of the gas reservoirs.


#### [Elevation or Suppression? The Resolved Star Formation Main Sequence of Galaxies with Two Different Assembly Modes](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.00319)
    * We demonstrate that the correlation between the stellar mass surface density (Σ∗) and star formation rate surface density (ΣSFR) holds down to sub-galactic scale
    *  we find the resolved main sequence in galaxies with ‘outside-in’ mode is steeper than that in galaxies with ‘inside-out’ mode.
    * 把星系分成inside-out和outside-in两种assembly modes，不确定是不是合理


#### [A Catalog of Post-starburst Quasars from Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 7](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.00366)
    - **Interesting**
    * After carefully decomposing spectra from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) Data Release 7 (DR7) Quasar Catalog into quasar and host-galaxy components, we derive a sample of 208 PSQs. Their host-galaxy components have strong Hδ absorption (EW ≥ 6) indicating a significant contribution of an intermediate-aged stellar population formed in a burst of star formation within the past 1 Gyr

#### [Evolution of the anti-truncated stellar profiles of S0 galaxies since z=0.6 in the SHARDS survey: II - Structural and photometric evolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.00570)
    - **Relevant, Interesting**
    * We find that the inner and outer scale-lengths of Type-III S0 galaxies at 0.4 < z < 0.6 follow compatible trends and scaling relations with those observed in local S0 galaxies as a function of the break radius
    * 颜色梯度也没有明显变化
    * In contrast to Type-II (down-bending) profiles, the anti-truncated surface brightness profiles of S0 galaxies present compatible Rbreak values and scaling relations during the last 6 Gyr.


#### [No Evidence for Periodic Variability in the Light Curve of Active Galaxy J0045+41n](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.00691)
    * We demonstrate that the claimed periodicities are based on a misinterpretation of the null hypothesis test simulations and an error in the method used to calculate the false alarm probabilities. There is no evidence for periodicity in the data.


#### [Interrogating Seyferts with NebulaBayes: Spatially probing the narrow-line region radiation fields and chemical abundances](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.00740)
    - **Reference**
    * 用Bayesian方法看电离气体的电离参数
    * We observe near-constant ionization parameters but steeply radially-declining pressures, which together imply that radiation pressure regulates the ENLR density structure on large scales
    * We cannot separate variation in this intrinsic Epeak from the effects of shock or H II region contamination


#### [LINER galaxy properties and the local environment](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.00946)
    * The analysis of the host properties shows that the control sample exhibits a strong relation between the colours, ages and the local density, while more than 90% of the LINERs are redder and older than the mean values, independently of the neighbour- hood density


#### [The split in the ancient cold front in the Perseus cluster](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.00898)
    * We find that rather than broadening through diffusion, the cold front remains extremely sharp (consistent with abrupt jumps in density) but instead is split into two sharp edges.
    * magnetic draping can suppress diffusion for vast periods of time, around ∼5 Gyr, even as the cold front expands out to nearly half the cluster virial radius.

#### [The LABOCA/ACT Survey of Clusters at All Redshifts: multi-wavelength analysis of background submillimeter galaxies](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.01102)
    * LABOCA, ATCA 2.1GHz, PACS+SPIRE
    * LASCAR 870 μm maps were reduced using a multi-scale iterative pipeline that removes the SZE increment signal, yielding point-source sensitivities of σ ∼ 2mJybeam−1
    * Compared to −1.7 previous results for single-dish surveys, our redshift distribution has a comparatively larger fraction of sources at z > 3 and the high-redshift tail is more extended.


#### [Two more, bright, z > 6 quasars from VST ATLAS and WISE](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.01424)

    - **Important, Relevant**
    * By means of high-resolution two-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations, we study the three feedback (the thermalization of winds from AGBs, red giants, planetary nebula phases, SNe feedback, and AGN feedback) effects in suppressing star formation activities on the cosmological evolution of early-type galaxies with different stellar masses.

#### [Unveiling the dynamical state of massive clusters through the ICL fraction](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.04981)

    - **Relevant, Important**
    * 方法值得关注: The ICL fraction is calculated in three optical filters using the CHEFs IntraCluster Light Estimator, a robust and accurate algorithm free of a priori assumptions
    *  the ICL fraction in the three bands is, on average, higher for the merging clusters, ranging between ∼ 7−23%, compared with the ∼ 2−11% found for the relaxed systems.
    * we find a higher ICL fraction in the F606W filter for the merging clusters, consistent with an excess of lower-metallicity/younger stars in the ICL
    * 不过结果值得考虑，为什么merging会比relaxed的ICL比例高？难道不是relaxed的才是ICL已经就位的系统吗？

#### [X-ray scaling relations from a complete sample of the richest maxBCG clusters](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.05007)

    - **Interesting, Relevant**
    * 38个N>200的MaxBCG clusters
    * While the expected cluster temperatures should be scattered around 5 - 10 keV from the optical richness, the observed range extends to temperatures as low as 1.5 keV. (redMapper也是，smaller halo mass?)
    * Meanwhile, they follow normal LX −TX and LX −YX relations, which suggests that they are normal X-ray clusters.
    * However, the scatter of the LX − N and YX − N relations are also large and asymmetric with more outliers towards lower LX or YX .

#### [Galaxy And Mass Assembly (GAMA): impact of the group environment on galaxy star formation](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.05076)

    - **Relevant, Interesting**
    * We select 1197 Galaxy And Mass Assembly (GAMA) groups at 0.05 ≤ z ≤ 0.2 and analyze the projected phase space (PPS) diagram
    * We find that the fraction of star-forming group members is higher in the PPS regions dominated by recently accreted galaxies, whereas passive galaxies dominate the virialized regions.
    * we conclude for low-mass halos that star-forming group galaxies represent an infalling population from the field to the halo and show suppressed star formation.

#### [Revisiting the Cooling Flow Problem in Galaxies, Groups, and Clusters of Galaxies](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.04972)
    - **Important, Relevant**
    * 对cooling rate > 30 Msun/yr的星系: measure a slope in the SFR–M ̇ cool relation greater than unity, suggesting that the systems with the strongest cool cores are also cooling more efficiently. 冷却率低的星系里没有这个相关
    * Higher black hole accretion rates in the strongest cool cores, which could influence the total amount (saturating near the Eddington rate) and dominant mode (mechanical vs radiative) of feedback.

#### [Chaos and Variance in Galaxy Formation](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.05445)

    * we show how perturbations introduced by floating-point roundoff, random number generators, and seemingly trivial differences in algorithmic behaviour can produce non-trivial differences in star formation histories, circumgalactic medium (CGM) properties, and the distribution of stellar mass.
    * Instead, simulations map a point in a space of possible initial conditions points to a volume of possible final states.

#### [The Origin of Faint Tidal Features Around Galaxies in the RESOLVE Survey](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.05447)

    - **Relevant**
    * DECam Legacy Survey, which reaches an r-band 3σ depth of ∼27.9 mag arcsec−2 for a 100 arcsec2 feature.
    * The frequency of tidal features in the gas-poor (gas-to-stellar mass ratio < 0.1) subsample is lower than in the gas-rich subsample
    * These results suggest TFs in gas-poor galaxies are typically streams/shells from dry mergers or satellite disruption.
    * the presence of TFs around gas-rich galaxies does not correlate with stellar or halo mass, suggesting these TFs are often tails/arms from resonant interactions.

#### [Optical validation and characterization of Planck PSZ1 sources at the Canary Islands observatories. I. First year of ITP13 observations](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.05764)

    * Five of seven high-metallicity, absorption-selected galaxies at intermediate redshifts, z ≈ 0.5 − 0.8, have large molecular gas masses
    * The high-metallicity absorption-selected galaxies at z ≈ 0.5 − 0.8 appear distinct from populations of star-forming galaxies
    * 分子气体贮藏大，但是SFR低，可能正在transition？(但为什么吸收气体的金属丰度高)


#### [Prediction of Supernova Rates in Known Galaxy-galaxy Strong-lens Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.07569)
    * We build a compilation of 128 galaxy-galaxy strong-lens systems from the Sloan Lens ACS Survey (SLACS)
    * Within this compilation, we estimate the event rates of strongly-lensed Type Ia SN (SNIa) and core-collapse SN (CCSN) to be 1.23 ± 0.12 and 10.4 ± 1.1 per year


#### [Stellar Population Properties of Ultracompact Dwarfs in M87: a Mass-metallicity Correlation Connecting Low-metallicity Globular Clusters and Compact Ellipticals](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.07577)
    - **Relevant**
    * The M87 UCDs have ages   8 Gyr and [α/Fe] ≃ 0.4 dex 基于Lick index
    * The literature UCDs, located in lower-density environments than M87, extend to younger ages and smaller [α/Fe] (at given metallicities) than M87 UCD
    * The Virgo dE nuclei largely follow the average MZR of UCDs, whereas most of the M87 GCs are offset towards higher metallicities for given stellar masses.


#### [The Swift/BAT AGN Spectroscopic Survey -- IX. The clustering environments of an unbiased sample of Local AGN](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.07589)
    * projected cross-correlation function between the AGN and 2MASS galaxies, and interpreting it via halo occupation distribution (HOD) and subhalo-based models
    * We also find evidence that obscured AGN tend to reside in denser environments than unobscured AGN, even when samples were matched in luminosity, redshift, stellar mass, and Eddington ratio. 和Host halo的assembly history有关？


#### [Gravitationally Lensed Quasars in Gaia: II. Discovery of 24 Lensed Quasars](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.07601)
    * Candidates were selected in the Pan-STARRS footprint with quasar-like WISE colours or as pho- tometric quasars from SDSS, requiring either multiple detections in Gaia or a single Gaia detection near a morphological galaxy
    * 利用的是GAIA 0.1“的高空间分辨率


#### [Formation of S0s via disc accretion around high-redshift compact ellipticals](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.07745)
    - **Relevant**
    *  In particular, we show that the merger with a massive gas-rich satellite can lead to the formation of a baryonic disc around an elliptical.
    * As a consequence, S0s in the field may be the most likely candidates to have evolved from elliptical progenitors. Our scenario also naturally explains recent observations which indicate that field S0s may have older bulges than discs, contrary to cluster S0s which seem to have older discs than bulges.
