#### [How galaxies form stars: the connection between local and global star formation in galaxy simulations](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.00007)
    * global depletion times and star-forming gas
mass fractions in simulated galaxies exhibit systematic and well-defined trends as a function of the local star formation efficiency per freefall time, εff, strength of stellar feedback, and star formation threshold


#### [Storm in a Teacup: X-ray view of an obscured quasar and superbubble](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.00009)
    * High resolution Chandra imaging data reveal a ≈ 10 kpc loop of X-ray emission
    * The X-ray emission from this structure is in good agreement with a shocked thermal gas
    * 一个辐射主导的AGN，X-ray光度和bubble的能量之间的关系和radio-mode下的feedback的关系差不多


#### [X-ray scaling relations of early-type galaxies](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.00020)
    - **Relevant**
    * This steepening indicates that their atmospheres are heated above the level expected from gravitational infall alone. Energetic feedback from nuclear black holes and supernova explosions are likely heating agents.
    * Higher stellar velocity dispersions and higher metallicities are found in hotter, brighter, and more massive atmospheres.


#### [Field spheroid-dominated galaxies in a Λ-CDM Universe](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.00034)
    * However, the simulated galaxies are bluer and with higher star formation rates than observed isolated early-type galaxies.


#### [The OIII profiles of infrared-selected active galactic nuclei: More powerful outflows in the obscured population](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.00083)
    * The IR-selected obscured sources contain a mixture of narrow-lined Type 2 AGN and intermediate sources that have broad Hα emission and significantly narrower Hβ
    * In matched bins of luminosity we find that the obscured population typically has broader, more blueshifted [Oiii] emission than in the unobscured sample, suggestive of more powerful AGN- driven outflows.
    * geometric unification models 不足以解释红外AGN需要在obscured和unobscured之间有演化


#### [Intermediate line emission in AGN: the effect of gas density prescription](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.00090)
    * We found that the low ionization iron line, Fe II, appears to be highly sensitive for the presence of dust and therefore becomes potential tracer of dust content in line emitting regions.


#### [GOODS-ALMA: 1.1 mm galaxy survey - I. Source catalogue and optically dark galaxies](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.00157)
    * 69平方角分，0.60" beam; 20 sources brighter than 0.7 mJy
    * Our sample includes 20% HST –dark galaxies (4 out of 20), 都有红外探测
    * At least 40% of the ALMA sources host an X-ray AGN, compared to ∼14% for other galaxies of similar mass and redshift.


#### [Discovery of an extremely-luminous dust-obscured galaxy observed with SDSS, WISE, JCMT, and SMA](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.00177)
    * An extremely-luminous dust-obscured galaxy (DOG) at zspec = 3.703,
WISE J101326.25+611220.1.
    * AGN-dominated DOG


#### [Molecular gas reservoirs in cluster galaxies at z=1.46](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.00298)
    - **Relevant, Interesting**
    * We detect dust continuum emission at 870 μm and CO J = 2–1 emission line from 8 and 17 member galaxies respectively within a cluster-centric radius of R200.
    * the fraction of molecular gas mass and the depletion time scale for the cluster galaxies are larger than expected from the scaling relations of molecular gas on stellar mass and offset from the main sequence of star-forming galaxies in general fields.
    * Therefore, the massive galaxies in the cluster core quench the star formation activity while consuming most of the gas reservoirs.


#### [Elevation or Suppression? The Resolved Star Formation Main Sequence of Galaxies with Two Different Assembly Modes](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.00319)
    * We demonstrate that the correlation between the stellar mass surface density (Σ∗) and star formation rate surface density (ΣSFR) holds down to sub-galactic scale
    *  we find the resolved main sequence in galaxies with ‘outside-in’ mode is steeper than that in galaxies with ‘inside-out’ mode.
    * 把星系分成inside-out和outside-in两种assembly modes，不确定是不是合理


#### [A Catalog of Post-starburst Quasars from Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 7](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.00366)
    - **Interesting**
    * After carefully decomposing spectra from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) Data Release 7 (DR7) Quasar Catalog into quasar and host-galaxy components, we derive a sample of 208 PSQs. Their host-galaxy components have strong Hδ absorption (EW ≥ 6) indicating a significant contribution of an intermediate-aged stellar population formed in a burst of star formation within the past 1 Gyr

#### [Detecting metal-poor gas accretion in the star-forming dwarf galaxies UM 461 and Mrk 600](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.00537)
    * 两个有并和迹象的星系的气态丰度的分布，看吸积的证据
    * UM461里找到了一点证据


#### [RELICS: Strong-lensing analysis of the massive clusters MACS J0308.9+2645 and PLCK G171.9-40.7](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.00560)
    * both clusters have particularly large Einstein radii (θE > 30′′ for a source redshift of zs = 2), providing fairly large areas with high magnifications
    * 对高红移星系搜索有帮助

#### [Evolution of the anti-truncated stellar profiles of S0 galaxies since z=0.6 in the SHARDS survey: II - Structural and photometric evolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.00570)
    - **Relevant, Interesting**
    * We find that the inner and outer scale-lengths of Type-III S0 galaxies at 0.4 < z < 0.6 follow compatible trends and scaling relations with those observed in local S0 galaxies as a function of the break radius
    * 颜色梯度也没有明显变化
    * In contrast to Type-II (down-bending) profiles, the anti-truncated surface brightness profiles of S0 galaxies present compatible Rbreak values and scaling relations during the last 6 Gyr.


#### [No Evidence for Periodic Variability in the Light Curve of Active Galaxy J0045+41n](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.00691)
    * We demonstrate that the claimed periodicities are based on a misinterpretation of the null hypothesis test simulations and an error in the method used to calculate the false alarm probabilities. There is no evidence for periodicity in the data.


#### [Interrogating Seyferts with NebulaBayes: Spatially probing the narrow-line region radiation fields and chemical abundances](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.00740)
    - **Reference**
    * 用Bayesian方法看电离气体的电离参数
    * We observe near-constant ionization parameters but steeply radially-declining pressures, which together imply that radiation pressure regulates the ENLR density structure on large scales
    * We cannot separate variation in this intrinsic Epeak from the effects of shock or H II region contamination


#### [LINER galaxy properties and the local environment](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.00946)
    * The analysis of the host properties shows that the control sample exhibits a strong relation between the colours, ages and the local density, while more than 90% of the LINERs are redder and older than the mean values, independently of the neighbour- hood density


#### [The split in the ancient cold front in the Perseus cluster](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.00898)
    * We find that rather than broadening through diffusion, the cold front remains extremely sharp (consistent with abrupt jumps in density) but instead is split into two sharp edges.
    * magnetic draping can suppress diffusion for vast periods of time, around ∼5 Gyr, even as the cold front expands out to nearly half the cluster virial radius.

#### [Red Misfits in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey: Properties of Star-forming Red Galaxies](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.01027)
    * Red optical color但形成恒星，不光是dusty edge-on导致的
    * The proportion of Red Misfits is nearly independent of environment and this population exhibits both intermediate morphologies and an enhanced likelihood of hosting an AGN.
    * transition population


#### [The LABOCA/ACT Survey of Clusters at All Redshifts: multi-wavelength analysis of background submillimeter galaxies](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.01102)
    * LABOCA, ATCA 2.1GHz, PACS+SPIRE
    * LASCAR 870 μm maps were reduced using a multi-scale iterative pipeline that removes the SZE increment signal, yielding point-source sensitivities of σ ∼ 2mJybeam−1
    * Compared to −1.7 previous results for single-dish surveys, our redshift distribution has a comparatively larger fraction of sources at z > 3 and the high-redshift tail is more extended.


#### [Two more, bright, z > 6 quasars from VST ATLAS and WISE](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.01424)
    * 3-D color space找高红移QSO：i − z : z − W1 : W1 − W2 with the WISE W1(3.4 micron) and W2 (4.5 micron) bands taking the place of the usual NIR J band to help decrease stellar dwarf contamination.

#### [Stellar and AGN feedback in isolated early-type galaxies: the role in regulating star formation and ISM properties](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.01444)
    - **Important, Relevant**
    * By means of high-resolution two-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations, we study the three feedback (the thermalization of winds from AGBs, red giants, planetary nebula phases, SNe feedback, and AGN feedback) effects in suppressing star formation activities on the cosmological evolution of early-type galaxies with different stellar masses.
