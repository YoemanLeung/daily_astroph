## Feb 4:

#### [An Absence of Radio-Loud Active Galactic Nuclei in Geometrically Flat Quiescent Galaxies: Implications for Maintenance-Mode Feedback Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.00515)
    * We demonstrate that at a fixed mass the incidence of radio-loud AGN identified in the FIRST and NVSS radio surveys among a large sample of quiescent (non-star forming) galaxies selected from the SDSS is much higher in geometrically round galaxies than in geometrically flat, disk-like galaxies.
    * 在固定的速度弥散度和恒星质量上也是如此; 而且不能用投影效应解释
    * The large fraction of radio-loud AGN in massive, round galaxies is consistent with the hypothesis that such AGN deposit energy into their hot gaseous halos, preventing cooling and star-formation.
    * the absence of such AGN in disk-like quiescent galaxies -- most of which are not satellites in massive clusters, raises important questions: is maintenance-mode feedback a generally valid explanation for quiescence;


#### [Diffuse polarized emission in the LOFAR Two-meter Sky Survey](https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.00531)
    * 用Faraday tomography方法刻画银河系的弥散偏振同步加速辐射：Faraday depth cube mosaic covering 568 square degrees at high Galactic latitudes
    * We observed many new polarization features, some up to 15 degrees in length. These include two regions with very uniformly structured, linear gradients in the Faraday depth
    * We also observed a relationship between one of the gradients and an HI filament in the local ISM. Other ISM tracers were also checked for correlations with our polarization data and none were found, but very little signal was seen in most tracers in this region


#### [Searching for Dual AGN in Galaxies with Double-Peaked Emission Line Spectra using Radio Observations](https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.00689)
    * One of the best ways to confirm dual/binary AGN in double-peaked AGN (DPAGN) is by using high resolution radio observations.
    * 用VLA检查已知的DP-AGN：We have detected dual radio structures at separation of ≲ 10 kpc in three of our sample galaxies. Using the spectral index maps and optical spectra of the sources, we have confirmed that one of them is a dual AGN (DAGN), while the other two can be dual AGN or AGN+ star-forming nuclei pairs.
    * The remaining 13 sources are single cores while one source is not detected at any frequency. We find that for our dual AGN detection, the DPAGN emission lines do not originate from the dual/binary AGN. Instead, they could be due to outflows or jets


#### [An intuitive 3D map of the Galactic warp's precession traced by classical Cepheids](https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.00998)
    * Here, we establish a robust Galactic disk model based on 1339 classical Cepheids. We provide strong evidence that the warp's line of nodes is not oriented in the Galactic Center-Sun direction.
    * Our Galaxy thus follows Briggs' rule for spiral galaxies, which suggests that the origin of the warp is associated with torques forced by the massive inner disk. The stellar disk traced by Cepheids follows the gas disk in terms of their amplitudes; the stellar disk extends to at least 20 kpc.


#### [The erratic dynamical life of black hole seeds in high-redshift galaxies](https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.01297)
    * To properly follow the dynamics of black holes we develop a physically motivated model to capture unresolved dynamical friction from stars, dark matter and gas
    * We first explore the dynamics of a seed black hole in the galaxy where it is born and show that it is highly erratic if the seed mass is less than 10^5M⊙.
    * The dynamics is dominated by the stellar component, whose distribution is irregular and patchy, thus inducing stochasticity in the orbits: the black hole may be anywhere in the proto-galaxy.

#### [Hunting for Galaxies and Halos in simulations with VELOCIraptor](https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.01010)
    * A massively parallel galaxy/(sub)halo finder that is also capable of robustly identifying tidally disrupted objects and separate stellar halos from galaxies
    * It can identify subhalos deep within the host that have negligible density contrasts to their parent halo.
    * We find a subhalo mass-radial distance dependence: large subhalos with mass ratios of ≳10−2 are more common in the central regions that smaller subhalos, a result of dynamical friction and low tidal mass loss rates. 其他的halo finder找不到这个关系

#### [AGN All the Way Down? AGN-like Line Ratios are Common In the Lowest-Mass Isolated Quiescent Galaxies](https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.01401)


#### [Metallicity calibrations for diffuse ionised gas and low ionisation emission regions](https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.01401)


#### [Yule-Simpson's paradox in Galactic Archaeology](https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.01421)
    - **Interesting**
    * Simpson's paradox, or the Yule-Simpson effect, arises when a trend appears in different subsets of data but disappears or reverses when these subsets are combined.
    * We describe here seven cases of this phenomenon for chemo-kinematical relations believed to constrain the Milky Way disk formation and evolution. We show that interpreting trends in relations, such as the radial and vertical chemical abundance gradients, the age-metallicity relation, and the metallicity-rotational velocity relation (MVR), can lead to conflicting conclusions about the Galaxy past if analyses marginalize over stellar age and/or birth radius.
    * This work highlights the necessity for precise age estimates for large stellar samples covering wide spatial regions.


#### [Constraints on high-J CO emission lines in z∼6 quasars](https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.01413)
    * ALMA观测：The continuum emission of both quasars arises from a compact region (<0.9 kpc) of the host galaxy
    * Only CO(8-7) and CO(9-8) in J2310 are detected, while 3σ upper limits on luminosities are reported for the other lines of both quasars
    * The CO line luminosities and upper limits measured in J2310 and J1319 are consistent with those observed in local AGN and starburst galaxies, and other z ∼ 6 quasars, except for SDSS J1148+5251 (J1148), the only quasar at z = 6.4 with a previous CO(17-16) line detection


#### [A Large Catalog of Accurate Distances to Local Molecular Clouds: The Gaia DR2 Edition](https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.01425)
    - **Interesting, 有Josh**
    * We infer the distance and extinction to stars along sightlines towards the clouds using optical and near-infrared photometry.
    * When available, we incorporate knowledge of the stellar distances obtained from Gaia DR2 parallax measurements. We model these per-star distance-extinction estimates as being caused by a dust screen with a 2-D morphology derived from Planck at an unknown distance, which we then fit for using a nested sampling algorithm.


#### [New constraints on red-spiral galaxies from their kinematics in clusters of galaxies](https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.01427)
    * We find that the probability distribution function of the pairwise line-of-sight velocity vlos between red-spiral galaxies and galaxy clusters has a dip at vlos = 0, which is a very odd feature, at 93% confidence level.
    * We adopt a two component model that consists of the infall component, which corresponds to galaxies that are now falling into galaxy clusters, and the splash- back component, which corresponds to galaxies that are on their first (or more) orbit after falling into galaxy clusters.
    * red-spiral galaxies reside predominantly in the infall component, regardless of the choice of the functional form of their spatial distribution. Our results constrain the quenching timescale of red-spiral galaxies to a few Gyrs,


#### [Radio Source Extraction with ProFound](https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.01440)
    * Typical radio source extraction software generates catalogues by using Gaussian components to form a model of the emission. This may not be well suited to complicated jet structures and extended emission
    * We find that ProFound can accurately recover both the flux densities of simulated Gaussian sources as well as extended radio galaxies. ProFound can create models that trace the complicated nature of these extended galaxies, which we show is not necessarily the case with other source extraction software.


#### [The Escape Fraction of Ionizing Photons During the Epoch of Reionization: Observability with the Square Kilometre Array](https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.01611)
    * we present such a model (is self-consistently coupled to galaxy evolution) and explore how physically motivated functional forms of fesc affect the evolution of ionized hydrogen within the intergalactic medium
    * Using the 21cm power spectrum evolution, we investigate the likelihood of observationally distinguishing between a constant fesc and other models that depend upon different forms of galaxy feedback. We find that changing the underlying connection between fesc and galaxy feedback drastically alters the large-scale 21cm power.
    * SKA 200  hours of integration time focused on redshift z=7.5−8.5可以把fesc限制好.


#### [What shapes a galaxy? - Unraveling the role of mass, environment and star formation in forming galactic structure](https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.01665)
    - **Relevant**
    * We utilise bulge-to-total stellar mass ratio, (B/T)_*, as the primary indicator of galactic structure, which circumvents issues of morphological dependence on waveband.
    * We rank galaxy and environmental parameters in terms of how predictive they are of galaxy structure, using an artificial neural network approach. We find that distance from the star forming main sequence (Delta_SFR), followed by stellar mass (M_*), are the most closely connected parameters to (B/T)_*
    * In both simulations (Illustris & L-Galaxies SAM), we find a significant lack of bulge-dominated galaxies at a fixed stellar mass, compared to the SDSS.


#### [Low-redshift lowest-metallicity star-forming galaxies in the SDSS DR14](https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.01775)
    - **Interesting, Relevant**
    * We present a sample of low-redshift (z < 0.133) candidates for extremely low-metallicity star-forming galaxies with oxygen abun- dances 12 + logO/H < 7.4 selected from the Data Release 14 (DR14)
    * 发展了一个专门估计贫金属星系气体丰度的强线判据
    * In total, our list of selected candidates for extremely low-metallicity galaxies includes 66 objects.

## Feb 6:

#### [The mean Hα EW and Lyman-continuum photon production efficiency for faint z≈4−5 galaxies](https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.02786)
    * Lyman-continuum photon production efficiency ξion,0 at z∼4-5 for galaxies fainter than 0.2 L∗ (−19 mag)
    * Extending previous measurements of ξion,0 to the faint population is important, as ultra-faint galaxies are expected to contribute the bulk of the ionizing emissivity
    * We probe ξion,0 to such faint magnitudes by taking advantage of 200-hour depth Spitzer/IRAC observations from the GREATS program and ≈300 3<z<6 galaxies with spectroscopic redshifts from the MUSE GTO Deep + Wide programs.
    * ξion shows no strong dependence on MUV. The ξion,0 values found in our sample imply that the Lyman-continuum escape fraction for MUV≈−19 star-forming galaxies cannot exceed ≈8-20\% in the reionization era.


#### [Does AGN Fraction Depend on Redshift or Luminosity? An Extinction-Free Test by 18-band Mid-infrared SED Fitting in the AKARI NEP Wide Field](https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.02800)
    * Our AKARI North Ecliptic Pole (NEP) wide field sample has 18 filters in mid-IR (9 from AKARI, 4 from WISE, and 5 from Spitzer), for the first time, allowing a sophisticated mid-IR SED fitting diagnosis for a statistical number of sources (89178 over 5.4 deg2)
    * We found that the AGN fraction (FAGN) shows no sign of strong redshift evolution. Instead, FAGN increases with increasing IR luminosity in all redshifts bins (0<z<2).


#### [Infrared luminosity functions based on 18 mid-infrared bands: revealing cosmic star formation history with AKARI and Hyper Suprime-Cam](https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.02801)
    - **Useful**; HSC在AKARI NEP field有深场数据
    * Using the new Hyper Suprime-Cam on Subaru telescope, we obtained deep enough optical images of the entire AKARI NEP field in 5 broad bands (g∼27.5mag).
    * We have measured restframe 8μm, 12μm luminosity functions (LFs), and estimated total infrared LFs at 0.35<z<2.2. Our results are consistent with our previous work, but with much reduced statistical errors thanks to the large area coverage of the new data. We have possibly witnessed the turnover of CSFH at z∼2.


#### [Kiloparsec-scale Variations in the Star Formation Efficiency of Dense Gas: the Antennae Galaxies (NGC 4038/39)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.02809)
    * 校准了一个有空间分辨的LIR和HCN的关系
    * We study the relationship between dense gas and star formation in the Antennae galaxies by comparing ALMA observations of dense gas tracers (HCN, HCO+, and HNC J=1−0) to the total infrared luminosity (LTIR)
    * The Antennae extends the linear LTIR−LHCN relationship found in previous studies. The LTIR−LHCN ratio varies by up to a factor of ∼10 across different regions of the Antennae implying variations in the star formation efficiency of dense gas, with the nuclei, NGC 4038 and NGC 4039, showing the lowest SFEdense (0.44 and 0.70 ×10−8 yr−1). The nuclei also exhibit the highest dense gas fractions (∼9.1% and ∼7.9%).


#### [Quenching low-mass satellite galaxies: evidence for a threshold ICM density](https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.02820)
    - **Interesting, Relevant**
    * We study the quenched fractions of satellite galaxies as a function of ICM density for low- (10^9≲M⋆≲10^10M⊙), intermediate- (10^10≲M⋆≲10^10.5M⊙), and high-mass (M⋆≳10^10.5M⊙) satellite galaxies with >3000 satellite galaxies across 24 low-redshift (z<0.1) clusters
    * For low-mass galaxies we find evidence for a broken powerlaw trend between satellite quenched fraction and local ICM density. 似乎有一个临界点密度，在这个ICM密度以上，卫星星系迅速quenched掉
    * We show that this increase in quenched fraction at high ICM density is well matched by a simple, analytic model of ram pressure stripping.


#### [The Extremely High Dark Matter Halo Concentration of the Relic Compact Elliptical Galaxy Mrk 1216](https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.02938)
    - **Interesting, Relevant**
    * we use a new ≈122 ks Chandra observation together with a shallow ≈13 ks archival observation of the CEG Mrk 1216 to perform a hydrostatic equilibrium analysis of the luminous and relaxed X-ray plasma emission extending out to a radius 0.85r2500.
    * We examine several DM model profiles and in every case obtain a halo concentration (c200) that is a large positive outlier in the theoretical ΛCDM c200−M200 relation
    * The high value of c200 we measure implies an unusually early formation time that firmly establishes the relic nature of the DM halo in Mrk 1216.
    * Mrk 1216 contains ≈80% of the cosmic baryon fraction within r200. The radial profile of the ratio of cooling time to free-fall time varies within a narrow range (tc/tff≈14−19) over a large central region (r≤10 kpc) suggesting "precipitation-regulated AGN feedback" for a multiphase plasma,


#### [Star formation in far-IR AGN and non-AGN galaxies in the green valley. II. Morphological analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.02969)
    * Morphological properties of 103 green valley FIR active and 2609 non-active galaxies presented in Mahoro et al. 2017.
    * We found that the fraction of peculiar galaxies with clear signs of interactions and mergers is significantly higher in AGN (38%) than non-AGN (19%) green valley galaxies, while non-AGN galaxies from our sample are predominantly spirals (46%).
    * We found that the largest fraction of our green valley galaxies is located on the main-sequence (MS) of star formation


#### [Conditions for Reionizing the Universe with A Low Galaxy Ionizing Photon Escape Fraction](https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.02792)
    * We combine simulation-based halo-mass dependent escape fractions with an extrapolation of the observed galaxy rest-ultraviolet luminosity functions to solve for the reionization history from z=20 to z=4
    * Our fiducial model can match observational constraints with an average escape fraction of <5% throughout the bulk of the epoch of reionization if:
        - i) galaxies form stars down to the atomic cooling limit before reionization and a photosuppression mass of log(M_h/Msol)~9 during/after reionization (-13<M_UV,lim<-11);
        - ii) galaxies become more efficient producers of ionizing photons at higher redshifts and fainter magnitudes
        - iii) there is a significant, but sub-dominant, contribution by AGN at z < 7.
    * In this model the faintest galaxies (M_UV>-15) dominate the ionizing emissivity, leading to an earlier start to reionization and a smoother evolution of the ionized volume filling fraction than models which assume a single escape fraction at all redshifts and luminosities.


#### [Impact of inhomogeneous reionization on the Lyman-α forest](https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.02892)
    * The Lyman-α forest at high redshifts is a powerful probe of reionization. Modeling and observing this imprint comes with significant technical challenges: the memory fades away swiftly, hence one must focus on high redshifts
    * In addition, inhomogeneous reionization must be taken into account while simultaneously being able to resolve the web-like small-scale structure, which has gone fully non-linear prior to reionization.
    * 用模拟研究：We find that inhomogeneous reionization could produce a measurable effect on the Lyman-α forest power spectrum


#### [Role of intracluster supernovae in radio mini-halos in galaxy clusters](https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.02994)
    - **Interesting**
    * A possibility of generating a population of cosmic-ray particles accelerated in supernovae typeIa (SNIa) remnants in the intracluster medium (ICM) is discussed. The presently constrained host-less SNIa rates in the clusters are found to be sufficient to fill a few hundred kpc region with cosmic-ray electrons within their typical synchrotron life-time of 100 Myr.
    * A good fraction of total radio power from mini-halos can be sourced from the SNIa energy deposited in the ICM with required energy conversion efficiency <1 per cent. The radio power estimated from low Mach number shock acceleration in SNIa remnants is consistent with the observations within the uncertainties in the estimates.


#### [Impact of photometric redshifts on the galaxy power spectrum and BAO scale in the LSST survey](https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.03004)
    * We evaluate the efficiency of our photometric redshift reconstruction on mock galaxy catalogs up to z=2.45 and estimate the impact of realistic photometric redshift (hereafter photo-z) reconstruction on the large-scale structures (LSS) power spectrum and the baryonic acoustic oscillation (BAO) scale determination for a LSST-like photometric survey.
    * We have computed the fractional error on the recovered power spectrum which is dominated by the shot-noise at z>1 for scales k>0.1, due to the photo-z damping. The BAO scale can be recovered with a percent or better accuracy level from z = 0.5 to z = 1.5 using realistic photo-z reconstruction

## Feb 11:

#### [Multi-wavelength properties of Type 1 and Type 2 AGN Host Galaxies in the Chandra-COSMOS Legacy Survey](https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.03244)
    * 3701 X-ray-selected active galactic nuclei (AGNs) out to z~5 in the Chandra-COSMOS Legacy Survey
    * Type 1 and Type 2 AGNs follow the same intrinsic Lx-L6um relation, suggesting that mid-infrared emission is a reasonably good measure of the AGN accretion power regardless of obscuration
    * We find that there is a strong increase in Type 1 AGN fraction toward higher AGN luminosity, possibly due to the fact that Type 1 AGNs tend to be hosted by more massive galaxies
    * AGN host galaxies tend to have SFRs that are consistent with normal star-forming galaxies, independent of AGN luminosities. We confirm that black hole accretion rate and SFR are correlated up to z ∼ 5, when forming stars.


#### [Chandra Detection of Intra-cluster X-ray Sources in Fornax](https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.03733)
    * We detect 1177 point sources out to a projected radius of ∼30 arcmin (∼180 kpc) from the cluster center
    * From this profile we statistically identify ∼183 excess sources that are not associated with the bulk stellar content of the individual member galaxies of Fornax, nor with the cosmic X-ray background.
    * We show that a large fraction of the excess can be related to the extended stellar halo of NGC1399 and/or the diffuse intra-cluster light, thus providing strong evidence for the presence of intra-cluster X-ray sources in Fornax


#### [Outlying Hα emitters in SDSS IV MaNGA](https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.03754)
    * 有点像之前Lihwai Lin找到的那个例子：We have discovered six outlying Hα emitters with no bright underlying optical continuum emission in DECaLS, MzLS and BASS.
    * They also show a ve- locity field which is different from that of the host galaxy. These outlying Hα emitters all have extended structure in the Hα image.
    * Their emission line ratios show that they are photoionised due to an active galactic nucleus (AGN) or a mixture of both an AGN and star formation


#### [Recovering stellar population parameters via different population models and stellar libraries](https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.03759)
    - **Relevant**
    * Based on these setups, we select five SSP libraries generated with the Galaxev/STELIB and Vazdekis/MILES models, and apply them to the pPXF full-spectrum fitting of both MaNGA and mock spectra.
    * 1) Compared to the Galaxev/STELIB model, spectral fitting qualities with the Vazdekis/MILES model have significant improvements for those metal-rich (especially over-solar) spectra
    * 2) When applying the Vazdekis/MILES model for spectral fitting, the IMF variation will lead to not only a systematic offset in M∗/Lr, but also offsets in age and metal- licity, and these offsets increase with increasing stellar population ages
    * 3) The Padova2000 model provides a better match to the MaNGA galaxy spectra at [M/H]L < −1.0, while the BaSTI model match the local galaxy spectra better at [M/H]L > −1.0.


#### [SDSS IV MaNGA: Full spectroscopic bulge-disc decomposition of MaNGA early-type galaxies](https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.03792)
    - **Relevant**
    * Bulges tend to be consistently more metal rich than their disc counterparts, and while the ages of both components are comparable, there is an interesting tail of younger, more metal poor discs
    * Bulges and discs follow their own distinct kinematic relationships, both on the plane of the stellar spin parameter, λR, and ellipticity, ε, and in the relation between stellar mass, M∗, and specific angular momentum, j∗


#### [A Uniformly Selected, All-Sky, Optical AGN Catalog](https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.03799)
    * We have constructed an all-sky catalog of optical AGNs with z<0.09, based on optical spectroscopy, from the parent sample of galaxies in the 2MASS Redshift Survey (2MRS), a near-complete census of the nearby universe
    * Our catalog consists of 1929 broad line AGNs, and 6562 narrow line AGNs which satisfy the \citet{Kauffmann03} criteria, of which 3607 also satisfy the \citet{Kewley01} criteria


#### [The MBHBM* Project -- I: Measurement of the Central Black Hole Mass in Dwarf Galaxy NGC 3504 Using Molecular Gas Kinematics](https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.03813)
    * We present the first measurement of the mass of a supermassive black hole (SMBH) in the nearby double-barred spiral galaxy NGC 3504 用ALMA CO数据
    * 用核周气体盘运动学建模估算SMBH质量：This black hole (BH) mass is consistent with BH--galaxy scaling relations.
    * We also detect a central deficiency in the 12CO(2−1) integrated intensity map with a diameter of 2.7 pc at the putative position of the SMBH. 但洞里填充了CS(5-4)致密分子气体


#### [A New Method to Measure Star Formation Rates in Active Galaxies Using Mid-infrared Neon Emission Lines](https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.03849)
    * Being less sensitive to dust extinction, the mid-infrared fine-structure lines of [NeII] 12.81 micron and [NeIII] 15.56 micron effectively trace the SFR in star-forming galaxies. These lines also have the potential to serve as a reliable SFR indicator in active galaxies
    * We demonstrate that AGNs emit a relatively restricted range of [NeII]/[NeV] and [NeIII]/[NeV] ratios. Hence, once [NeV] is measured, the AGN contribution to the low-ionization Ne lines can be estimated, and the SFR can be determined from the strength of [NeII] and [NeIII].
    * We find that AGN host galaxies have similar properties as compact extragalactic HII regions, which indicates that the star formation in AGN hosts is spatially concentrated.


#### [Fluorescent C II* 1335Å emission spectroscopically resolved in a galaxy at z = 5.754](https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.03880)
    * Discovery of the first spectroscopically resolved C II/C II* 1334, 1335 doublet in the Lyman-break galaxy J0215–0555 at zLyα = 5.754.
    * The separation of the resonant and fluorescent emission channels was possible thanks to the large redshift of the source and long integration time, as well as the small velocity width of the feature, 0.6 ± 0.2Å.
    * We suggest that the close alignment between the fluorescence and Lyman-α emission could indicate an ionisation escape channel within the object.
        - In addition to this back-scattered emission, resonantly trapped radiation sometimes has access to alternative fluorescent decay channels. This occurs when excited atoms decay into an excited ground state, giving rise to emission of a different wavelength to the resonant absorption by the gas


#### [NIHAO XIX: How supernova feedback shapes the galaxy baryon cycle](https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.03888)
    * We find that SN feedback operates on all scales from the interstellar medium (ISM) to several virial radii.
    * SNe regulate star formation by preventing condensation of Hi into H2 and by moving cold neutral gas to the hot Hii phase.
    * 20% to 70% of the gas expelled from galaxies es- capes from the halo (ejective feedback) but outflows are dominated by cold swept-up gas, most of which falls back onto the galaxy on a ∼ 1 Gyr timescale.


#### [An IFU investigation of possible Lyman continuum escape from Mrk 71/NGC 2366](https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.03952)
    * Mrk 71/NGC 2366 is the closest Green Pea (GP) analog and candidate Lyman Continuum (LyC) emitter. Recently, 11 LyC-leaking GPs have been detected through direct observations of the ionizing continuum, making this the most abundant class of confirmed LyC-emitters at any redshift.
    * An electron density map is obtained from the [S II] ratio. A fortuitous second order contamination by the [O II] λ3727 doublet enables the construction of an electron temperature map. Resolved maps of sound speed, thermal broadening, “true” velocity dispersion, and Mach number are obtained and compared to the high resolution magneto-hydrodynamic SILCC simulations.
    * Our results strongly indicate that kinematical feedback is an important ingredient for LyC leakage in GPs.


#### [QSOs acting as gravitational lenses: halo mass and projected mass density profile at z∼0.7](https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.03624)
    - **Interesting**
    * Magnification bias is a gravitational lensing effect that is normally overlooked because it is considered sub-optimal in comparison with the lensing shear.
    * In this work we were able to measure the magnification bias produced by a sample of QSOs acting as lenses, 0.2 < z < 1.0, on the SMGs observed by Herschel at 1.2 < z < 4.0.
    * From the halo modelling of the cross-correlation function, the QSOs host halo mass was estimated to be greater than 10^{13.6}
    * Moreover, we were able to estimate the lensing convergence, κ(θ), for our magnification bias measurements down to a few kpcs. The derived mass density profile shows a core in its centre and it is compatible with a Navarro-Frank-White (NFW) profile.


#### [Weak lensing cosmology with convolutional neural networks on noisy data](https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.03663)
    - **Interesting?**
    * Due to gravitational collapse, the distribution of dark matter is non- Gaussian on small scales. However, observations are typically evaluated through the two-point correlation function of galaxy shear, which does not capture non-Gaussian features of the lensing maps.
    * We show that a CNN is able to yield significantly stricter constraints of (σ8, Ωm) cosmological parameters than the power spectrum using convergence maps generated by full N-body simulations and ray-tracing


#### [Sub-Eddington super-massive black hole activity in Fornax early type galaxies](https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.03328)
    * A nuclear X-ray point-source is detected in 11 out of 29 targets. After accounting for the low mass X-ray binary contamination to the nuclear X-ray signal, the X-ray active fraction is measured at 26.6%±9.6%.
    * we find no statistically significant difference between Fornax and Virgo galaxies, with only marginal evidence for a lower active fraction in Fornax (1 σ); if real, owing to Fornax's higher galaxy number density, this could indicate that galaxy-galaxy interactions are more effective at gas removal than galaxy-gas effects.

#### [The Coevolution of Massive Quiescent Galaxies and their Dark Matter Halos over the Last 6 Billion Years](https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.04087)
    - **Relevant, Important**
    * Our three parameter model links quiescent galaxies across cosmic time by self-consistently evolving stellar mass, stellar population age sensitive Dn4000 index, half-light radius and stellar velocity dispersion. Dn4000，或者说年龄，是scaling relation驱动的。
    * Stellar velocity dispersion is a robust proxy of dark matter halo mass; we use it to connect galaxies and dark matter halos and thus empirically constrain their coevolution. 仍然认为速度弥散度更好。恒星质量是直接用光度加上固定的M/L来的。
    * Thus, the stellar mass-halo mass relation of massive galaxies apparently results primarily from dry minor merging.


#### [A Wide-field Photometric Survey of Globular Clusters in the Peculiar Early-type Galaxy M85](https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.04088)
    - **Relevant**
    * MegaCam观测：We identify 1318 GC candidates with 20.0 mag < g0 < 23.5 mag in the entire survey region.
    * Their radial number density profile is well fit by a S ́ersic profile with n = 2.58； Re=22 kpc
    * The overall color distribution of the GCs in M85 is bimodal, but the GCs in the central region at R < 2′ do not show a bimodal distribution clearly. Blue GC比Red的分布要延展
    * The mean (g − i)0 color of the RGCs in M85 is about 0.1 mag bluer than typical values for other Virgo early-type galaxies of similar luminosity, indicating that a significant fraction of the RGCs in M85 may be younger than typical GCs


#### [The structural properties of classical bulges and discs from z∼2](https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.04089)

    * In most ULIRGs, the HCN-to-HCO+ J=3-2 flux ratios in the nuclear regions within the beam size are systematically higher than those in the spatially extended regions. The elevated nuclear HCN J=3-2 emission could be related to (a) luminous buried active galactic nuclei, (b) the high molecular gas density and temperature in ULIRG's nuclei, and/or (c) mechanical heating by spatially compact nuclear outflows
    * The observed nearby ULIRGs are generally rich in dense (>10^5 cm^-3) molecular gas, with an estimated mass of >10^9 Msun within the nuclear (a few kpc) regions

#### [CIV Black Hole Mass Measureents with the Australian Dark Energy Survey (OzDES)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.04206)
    * In this paper we present two measurements of supermassive black hole masses from reverberation mapping (RM) of the broad CIV emission line.
    * The corresponding masses of the two supermassive black holes are 4.4×10^9 and 3.3×10^9 M⊙, which are among the highest-redshift and highest-mass black holes measured to date with RM studies.
    * We use these new measurements to better determine the CIV radius−luminosity relationship for high-luminosity quasars, which is fundamental to many quasar black hole mass estimates and demographic studies.


#### [GASP. XV. A MUSE View of Extreme Ram-Pressure Stripping along the Line of Sight: Physical properties of the Jellyfish Galaxy JO201](https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.04486)
    * We present a study of the physical properties of JO201, a unique disk galaxy with extended tails undergoing extreme ram-pressure stripping as it moves through the massive cluster Abell 85 at supersonic speeds mostly along the line of sight
    * In this paper we present emission-line ratios, gas-phase metallicities and ages of the stellar populations across the galaxy disk and tails.
    * We find that while the emission at the core of the galaxy is dominated by an active galactic nucleus (AGN), the disk is composed of star-forming knots surrounded by excited diffuse gas
    * The collection of star-forming knots presents a metallicity gradient steadily decreasing from the centre of the galaxy outwards


#### [New Constraints on Quasar Evolution: Broad Line Velocity Shifts over 1.5≲z≲7.5](https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.04558)
    * a model-independent investigation of the rest-frame UV spectra from a comprehensive sample of 394 quasars in the redshift range 1.5≤z≤7.5
    * It is found that the average blueshift of the CIV, line with respect to several low-ionisation lines in luminosity-matched samples does not significantly evolve over 1.5≳z≳6.
    * However, the average blueshift increases significantly by a factor ∼2.5 at z≳6. We propose that this redshift evolution can be explained by CIV, winds launched perpendicularly to an accretion disk with increased torus opacity at high-redshift, coupled with a potential orientation-driven selection bias.

    * We measure bulge velocity dispersions using absorption lines and infer host black hole (BH) masses using the M – σ relation. 黑洞质量挺正常的

    * Host星系是10^7的quiescent星系，120天内增亮了2.5 mag; 然后在200天内变暗了0.5 mag
    * Following the optical brightening are the significant mid-IR flares at 3.4 and 4.5μm, with a peak time delay of ∼ 180 days
    * Optical spectra over 400 days in the plateau phase revealed newly formed broad Hα,β emission with a FWHM of ∼ 3750kms−1
    * This flare also has a steeply rising UV continuum, detected by multi-epoch Swift data at +700 to +900 days post optical peak.
    * We propose that this event is a “turn-on” AGN, transitioning from a quiescent state to a type 1 AGN with a sub-Eddington accretion rate of 0.017M⊙/yr.

    * The FeII/MgII line flux ratio has been used to investigate the chemical evolution of high redshift active galactic nuclei (AGNs). No strong evolution has been found out to z~6, implying that the type 1a supernova activity has been already occurred in early universe.
    * 但也有可能是选择效应，这篇文章看12个低光度QSO，因为低光度往往意味着金属丰度低

    * examine the relation between the SFEs and the volume densities of molecular gas n(H2) in the eight different regions within the galactic disk -> We confirmed that SFE in the bar region is lower by 39% than that in the spiral arms.

#### [Spin evolution and feedback of supermassive black holes in cosmological simulations](https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.04651)
    * Here we introduce a new sub-grid model for the BH spin evolution in the moving-mesh code AREPO in order to improve the physical faithfulness of the BH modelling in galaxy formation simulations.
    * We account for several different channels of spin evolution, in particular gas accretion through a Shakura-Sunyaev α-disc, chaotic accretion, and BH mergers
    * We find that BHs with mass Mbh<10^8 M⊙ reach high spin values as they typically evolve in the coherent gas accretion regime, in which consecu- tive accretion episodes are aligned.
    * e also explore the hypothesis that the transition between the quasar and kinetic feedback modes is mediated by the accretion mode of the BH disc itself, i.e. the kinetic feedback mode is activated when the disc enters the self-gravity regime instead of by an ad-hoc switch tied to the BH mass

    * We investigate what shapes the infrared luminosity function of local galaxies by comparing it to the local infrared AGN luminosity function.
    * Our results show that infrared emission from AGN starts mixing into the galaxy luminosity function in the luminous infrared galaxy (LIRG) regime and becomes significant in the ultraluminous infrared galaxy (ULIRG) regime
    * We propose that as a result of the AGN contribution, the infrared galaxy luminosity function has a flatter high luminosity slope than UV/optical galaxy luminosity functions.

    * In particular, we make use of the findings of a previous work in which we have improved the void selection procedure, presenting an algorithm that redefines the void ridges and, consequently, their radius
    *  We find that a relation exists between the tracer used to sample the underlying dark matter density field and its unbiased counterpart. Moreover, we demonstrate that, as long as this relation is accounted for, the size function is a viable approach for studying cosmology with cosmic voids.

    * Compared to spectral methods, the geometric algorithm can identify resonant orbits within a few dynamical periods, crucial for understanding an evolving galaxy model.

    * It hence reaches a numerical resolution typical of zoom-in simulations, with a baryonic element mass of 8.5x10^4 Msun and an average cell size of 70-140 parsecs in the star-forming regions of galaxies.
    * Simultaneously, TNG50 samples ~700 (6,500) galaxies with stellar masses above 10^10 (10^8) Msun at z=1.
    * Coupled with the large-volume statistics, we characterize a diverse, redshift- and mass-dependent structural and kinematical morphological mix of galaxies all the way to early epochs.
    * For star-forming galaxies the fraction of disk-like morphologies, based on 3D stellar shapes, increases with both cosmic time and galaxy stellar mass.

#### [First Results from the TNG50 Simulation: Galactic outflows driven by supernovae and black hole feedback](https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.05554)
    * We find that the outflow mass loading is a non-monotonic function of galaxy stellar mass, turning over and rising rapidly above 10^10.5 M due to the action of the central black hole (BH)
    * Outflow velocity increases with stellar mass, and the bulk of material moves slowly (∼ 150 km/s at Milky Way mass).
    * we demonstrate that the TNG model can produce high velocity, multi-phase outflows which include cool, dense components. These outflows reach speeds in excess of 3000 km/s with an ejective, BH-driven origin.
    * We present a correlation between outflow velocity and offset from the star-forming main sequence – galaxies above the SFMS drive faster outflows


#### [The SAMI Galaxy Survey: Satellite galaxies undergo little structural change during their quenching phase](https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.05652)
    * Here, we investigate whether satellite quenching is accompanied by changes in stellar spin (quantified by the ratio of the rotational to dispersion velocity V/σ) for a sample of massive (M∗ >10^10 M⊙) satellite galaxies
    * As expected, at fixed stellar mass and ellipticity, satellites have lower star for- mation rate (SFR) and spin than the control centrals
    * However, most of the difference is in SFR, whereas the spin decreases significantly only for satellites that have already reached the red sequence
    * Our findings highlight the effect of progenitor bias in our understanding of galaxy transformation and they suggest that satellites undergo little structural change before and during their quenching phase.

    * We discuss that these clumps are probably not virialised, but transient agglomerations of smaller entities that might be virialised
    * Its spectral energy distribution is compatible with passive templates assembled from elliptical galaxies. While weak dust emission is present in the region, we show that no star formation is present and support the previous results that the dust is heated by the old and intermediate stellar population

    * We find that gravitationally bound multiple AGN systems tend to populate scales of ≲0.7 cMpc/h; this corresponds to angular separations of ≲100 arcsec and a line of sight velocity difference ≲200 km/sec

    * We find that a Kroupa et al. (1993) IMF has to be preferred when modelling late-type galaxies in the local universe. On the other hand, the comparison of stellar metallicity profiles and α-enhancement trends with observations of Milky Way stars shows a better agreement when a Kroupa (2001) IMF is assumed.

#### [On the Orbital Decay of Globular Clusters in NGC1052-DF2: Testing a Baryon-Only Mass Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.05959)
    - **Interesting**
    * We test the viability of such a scenario by examining whether in a `baryon-only' mass model, the observed GC population experiences rapid orbital decay due to dynamical friction.
    * we show that there is a substantial amount of realization-to-realization variance in the evolution of the GCs. Nevertheless, over 10 Gyr, some of the GCs experience significant orbital evolution. Others evolve less.
    * A combination of reduced dynamical friction in the galaxy core and GC-GC scattering keeps the GCs afloat, preventing them from sinking all the way to the galaxy center.
    * Therefore, if NGC1052-DF2 has no dark matter, some of its GCs must have formed further out, and the GC system must have been somewhat more extended in the past. The presence of a low mass cuspy halo, while allowed by the kinematics, seems improbable as significantly shorter inspiral timescales in the central region would quickly lead to the formation of a nuclear star cluster.

    * After discarding broad line active galactic nuclei we find 13 HeIIλ1640 detections from MUSE with a median MUV = −20.1 and 21 tentative HeIIλ1640 detections from other public surveys.
    * Excluding Lyα, all except two galaxies in our sample show at least one other rest-UV emission line, with CIII]λ1907,λ1909 being the most prominent.
    * Line ratios of our sample can be reproduced by moderately sub-solar photo-ionisation models, however, we find that including effects of binary stars lead to degeneracies in most free parameters.

    * We demonstrate the ability of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to mitigate systematics in the virial scaling relation and produce dynamical mass estimates of galaxy clusters with remarkably low bias and scatter.
    * We train each model as a regression over cluster mass using a labeled catalog of realistic mock cluster observations generated from the MultiDark simulation and UniverseMachine catalog
    * We then evaluate the performance of each model on an independent set of mock observations selected from the same simulated catalog. The CNN models produce cluster mass predictions with log-normal residuals of scatter as low as 0.127 dex


#### [From Dark Matter to Galaxies with Convolutional Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.05965)
    * In this paper, we propose to use deep learning to establish a mapping between the 3D galaxy distribution in hydrodynamic simulations and its underlying dark matter distribution.
    * One of the major challenges in this pursuit is the very high sparsity in the predicted galaxy distribution. To this end, we develop a two-phase convolutional neural network architecture to generate fast galaxy catalogues, and compare our results against a standard cosmological technique

#### [NIHAO XVIII: Origin of the MOND phenomenology of galactic rotation curves in a LCDM universe](https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.06751)
    * 用模拟解释RAR：We show that the RAR arises naturally in the NIHAO sample of 89 high-resolution LCDM cosmological galaxy formation simulations. The overall scatter from NIHAO is just 0.079 dex, consistent with observational constraints.
    * we show that the scatter depends on stellar mass: 质量越小，scatter越大
    * At high masses the intrinsic scatter is consistent with the zero scatter assumed by MOND, but at low masses the intrinsic scatter is non-zero, strongly disfavoring MOND.

    * Our optical photometric and spectroscopic monitoring campaign has recorded one major dimming event (and subsequent rise) over a period of around four years
    * We find that an intrinsic change in the luminosity is the most favoured explanation of the observations, based on a comparison of continuum and line variability and the apparent lagged response of the hot dust.

    * The existence of the extended [Cii] halo is the evidence of outflow remnants in the early galaxies and suggest that the outflows may be dominated by cold-mode outflows

#### [The global stability of M33: still a puzzle](https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.07222)
    * The inner disc of the local group galaxy M33 appears to be in settled rotational balance, and near IR images reveal a mild, large-scale, two-arm spiral pattern with no strong bar
    *  We find that currently favoured models are unstable to the formation of a strong bar of semi-major axis 2 < a_B < 3 kpc on a time-scale of 1 Gyr
    * 在模拟里，Bar的形成不受气体成分的影响，不受NSC质量的影响，但是改变星族质光比或者增加恒星的random motions，可以阻止Bar的形成
    * However, all three near-stable models support multi-arm spirals, and not the observed large-scale bi-symmetric spiral. Thus the survival of the current state of this exceptionally well-studied galaxy is not yet understood.


#### [Galaxy Merger Fractions in Two Clusters at z∼2 Using the Hubble Space Telescope](https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.07225)
    * z~2的cluster，HST图像: Using visual classifications as well as a variety of selection techniques, we measure merger fractions of 11+8.2−3.2 in IRC0222A and 18+7.8−4.5 in IRC0222B. In comparison, we measure a merger fraction of 5.0+1.1−0.8% for field galaxies at z∼2.
    * Our study indicates that the galaxy-galaxy merger fraction in clusters at z∼2 is enhanced compared the field population, but note that more cluster measurements at this epoch are needed to confirm our findings.

#### [Kinematics of the Tucana Dwarf Galaxy: An Unusually Dense Dwarf in the Local Group](https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.07228)

    * 和“Coordinated assembly"有些类似：`old' (H_beta < 3) low-sigma_* galaxies in high local density environment and inner regions within galaxy groups are enhanced in Mgb/<Fe>, while `young' (H_beta>3) galaxies and high-mass galaxies show no or less environmental dependence;
    * `old' galaxies with high-z_f show enhanced Mgb/<Fe> over low- and medium-z_f;
    * Mgb/<Fe> gradients are close to zero and show dependence on sigma_* but no obvious dependence on the environment or z_f.


#### [Unraveling the complex structure of AGN-driven outflows: IV. Comparing AGNs with and without strong outflows](https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.07560)
    * Integral field spectroscopy of six Type 2 AGNs at z < 0.1, which are selected as AGNs without strong outflows based on the kinematics of [Oiii] gas
    * We find significant difference between the kinematics of ionized gas and stars for two AGNs, which indicates the presence of AGN-driven outflows.


#### [On the origin of central abundance drops in the intracluster medium of galaxy groups and clusters](https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.07661)
    - **Interesting**
    * It has been proposed that this abundance drop may be due, at least partially, to the depletion of Fe into dust grains in the central, high-density regions. 如果这个图像属实，惰性气体元素的丰度不应该出现depletion
    * we test this scenario by measuring with Chandra data the radial profiles of Ar and Ne in a sample of 12 groups and clusters where a central drop in Fe abundance has been detected.
    * We confirm the presence of the Fe drop in 10 out of 12 clusters at more than 2σ c.l., and 4 Ar drops with similar significance; We also find 4 Ne drops
    * When comparing the profiles, we find that, on average, the abundance profiles of Ar and Ne are significantly higher than Fe and steeper toward the center, while they all gradually become consistent with solar composition at r ≥ 0.05r500.
    * This result confirms a scenario in which some fraction of Fe is depleted into dust grains in the inner regions, although the global central abundance drop is mostly due to mechanical processes, like the displacement of metal-rich ICM from the very center to larger radii by AGN-driven feedback.

    * We address this problem using an iterative algorithm to sequentially prune redundant features from synthetic PHOENIX spectra, and arrive at an optimal set of wavelengths with the strongest correlation with each of the output variables – Teff , log g, and [Fe/H].

#### [Blind chemical tagging with DBSCAN: prospects for spectroscopic surveys](https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.08201)
    * With precise measurements of stellar chemistry, chemical tagging may be able to group together stars born from the same gas cloud, regardless of their current positions and kinematics.
    * We use Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN) to group stars based on their spectra or abundances; these groups are matched to input clusters and are found to be highly homogeneous and complete.
    * Based on our fiducial model for the Milky Way, we predict recovering over 600 clusters with at least 10 observed members and 70% membership homogeneity in a sample similar to the APOGEE survey.


#### [Neutral Gas Properties and Lyα Escape in Extreme Green Pea Galaxies](https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.08204)
    * VLA 21cm observations of one Green Pea (GP), J160810+352809 (hereafter J1608), and HST COS spectra of 17 GP galaxies at z < 0.2
    * J1608 has the highest [O III] λ5007/[O II] λ3727 for star-forming galaxies in SDSS, and the 17 GPs have [O III]/[O II] ≥ 6.6
    * In the COS sample, eight GPs show Lyα absorption components, six of which also have Lyα emission
    * Using low-ionization absorption lines, we measure covering fractions (fcov) of 0.1−1, and find that fcov strongly anti-correlates with Lyα escape fraction.

    * MISM is found to have a small dependence on environment, while the depletion timescale remains constant (∼ 200 Myrs) across all environments
    * We find elevated MISM values at intermediate densities and lower values at high densities compared to low (field) densities


#### [Forecasting Angular Cross Correlations Between Diffuse X-ray Emission and the Thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich Effect](https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.08268)
    * X-ray & SZ: The cross-correlation between these effects eliminates noise bias and reduces observational systematic effects
    * Using analytic models for the cluster profile, we develop a halo model formalism to study this cross-correlation 预测eROSITA X Simons
    * X-ray观测是Signal主导的，sample varaince更重要：In particular, non-Gaussian (4-point) contributions to the errors highlight the utility of masking massive clusters.
    * We find that the cross spectrum is most sensitive to the overall scale of the profiles of pressure and electron density, as well as cosmological parameters σ8 and H0, but that the large number of parameters form a degenerate set, which makes extracting the information more challenging.


#### [Hydrodynamical moving-mesh simulations of the tidal disruption of stars by supermassive black holes](https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.08202)
    * We are here modelling the hydrodynamical evolution of realistic stars as they approach a SMBH on parabolic orbits, using for the first time the moving-mesh code AREPO, which is particularly well adapted to the problem through its combination of quasi-Lagrangian behaviour, low advection errors, and high accuracy typical of mesh-based techniques.
    * Interestingly, we find that the internal evolution of the remnant's core is strongly influenced by persistent vortices excited in the tidal interaction. These should be sites of strong magnetic field amplification, and the associated mixing may profoundly alter the subsequent evolution of the tidally pruned star.

    * detailed investigation of the star-formation history and conditions of a z=2.57 massive radio galaxy based on VLT/X-SHOOTER and ALMA observations.
    * neither instantaneous nor continuous star-formation history is consistent with the relative strength of the Si II λ1485 and S V λ1502 absorption. Rather, at least two bursts of star formation took place in the recent past, at 6+1−2 Myr and ≳20 Myr ago
    * 气体质量不高，depletion时标短
    * Because of the likely very young age of the radio source, our findings suggest that vigorous star formation consumes much of the gas and works in concert with the AGN to remove any residual molecular gas


#### [The Resolved Distributions of Dust Mass and Temperature in Local Group Galaxies](https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.08622)
    * SED模型拟合SMC, LMC, M31, M33的Herschel map: we derive the dust temperature, Td, and the dust mass surface density, Σd, at 13 parsec resolution for SMC and LMC, and at 167 parsec resolution for all targets.
    * We find that LMC has the highest mass-weighted average Td, while M31 and M33 have the lowest mass-weighted average Td.
    * Within a galaxy, star forming regions have higher Td and Σd relative to the overall distribution function, due to more intense heating by young stars and higher gas mass surface density.
    * 当分辨率变差的时候，温度测量倾向于偏低, 尘埃质量偏低：When we degrade the resolutions to mimic distant galaxies, the mass-weighted mean temperature gets warmer as the resolution gets coarser, meaning the temperature derived from unresolved observation is systematically higher than that in highly resolved observation.


#### [Simultaneous calibration of spectro-photometric distances and the Gaia DR2 parallax zero-point offset with deep learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.08634)
    - **Interesting**
    * we design a deep neural network trained on stars in common between Gaia and APOGEE that determines spectro-photometric distances to APOGEE stars, while including a flexible model to calibrate parallax zero-point biases in Gaia DR2.
    * Our spectro-photometric distances are more precise than Gaia at distances ≈2kpc from the Sun. We release a catalog of spectro-photometric distances for the entire APOGEE DR14 data set which covers Galactocentric radii 2kpc≲R≲19kpc
    * we find that the bulge and bar region at R≲5kpc clearly stands out in [Fe/H] and most abundance ratios.


#### [A `Numbers' Approach to Astronomical Correlations I: Introduction and Application to galaxy Scaling Relations](https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.08704)

    * Once a {\it catalogue} of properties and forces that define an object or physical system is established, the theorem allows one to select a complete set of Dimensionless quantities or {\it Numbers} on which structure must depend.

#### [Ubiquitous cold and massive filaments in cool core clusters](https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.09164)
    - **Relevant**
    * We observed molecular gas in 3 cool cluster cores: Centaurus, Abell S1101, and RXJ1539.5 and gathered ALMA and MUSE data for 12 other clusters.
    * Two objects show nuclear molecular disks. The optical nebula is certainly tracing the warm envelopes of cold molecular filaments.
    * the radial profile of the Hα/CO flux ratio is roughly constant for most of the objects, suggesting that (i) between 1.2 to 7 times more cold gas could be present and (ii) local processes must be responsible for the excitation.
    * Velocity and dispersions are low, below the escape velocity. Cold clouds should eventually fall back and fuel the AGN.

#### [A multi-wavelength de-blended Herschel view of the statistical properties of dusty star-forming galaxies across cosmic time](https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.09172)
    * We use state-of-the-art de-blended Herschel catalogue in the COSMOS field, generated by combining the Bayesian source extraction tool XID+ and informative prior on the spectral energy distributions
    * we are able to achieve more accurate measurements while probing ten times below the confusion limit.
    * However, our counts at 350 and 500 microns are considerably below previous Herschel results. This is due to previous studies suffering from source confusion which worsens towards longer wavelength.
    * The increased dynamic range of our measurements allows us to better measure the faint-end slope of the LF and measure the dust-obscured SFRD out to z~6.
    * We find that the fraction of dust obscured star-formation activity is at its highest (> 80%) around z ∼ 1 which then decreases towards both low and high redshift.


#### [Driving massive molecular gas flows in central cluster galaxies with AGN feedback](https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.09227)

    * ALMA images reveal a distribution of morphologies from filamentary to disk-dominated structures. 核周盘比较少见，大多是纤维状结构，可以延展到几十kpc
    * In nearly all cases the molecular gas velocities lie far below stellar velocity dispersions, indicating youth, transience or both
    * Filament bulk velocities lie far below the galaxy's escape and free-fall speeds indicating they are bound and being decelerated, a remarkable and poorly understood property.
    * Smooth velocity gradients found along the filaments are consistent with gas flowing along streamlines surrounding the rising radio bubbles.


#### [From kpcs to the central parsec of NGC 1097: feeding star formation and a black hole at the same time](https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.09370)

    * The ring is a place of intermittent star bursts over the last 100 Myr. Four major episodes covering a proto-cluster phase of eleven mid-IR sources at the molecular clouds core, and two (three) previous bursts with a time separation of 20 - 30 Myr are identified.

    * About 30% of the AGN are optically obscured; 50% of the WISE AGN at z<0.5 have emission line ratios consistent with star-forming galaxies
    * We find that 61% of X-ray AGN are not selected as MIR AGN, with 22% of X-ray AGN undetected by WISE 大多数都是高光度AGN，MIR挑选可能会损失掉一部分高光度的AGN
    * Conversely, ∼58% of WISE AGN are undetected by X-rays, though we do not find that they are preferentially redder than the X-ray detected WISE AGN.

    * For a sample of local galaxies and find that, after accounting for the average quenching effects of stellar mass and local density, Δ remains correlated out to separations of 3 Mpc.

    * The conductive heat flux into the shell is balanced by a combination of cooling in the interface and evaporation of shell gas into the bubble interior
    * 热传导效应很重要：This evaporation increases the density, and decreases the temperature, of the SB interior by more than an order of magnitude relative to simulations without conduction
    * 同时冷却更重要：most of the energy conducted into the interface is immediately lost to cooling, reducing the evaporative mass flux required to balance conduction.

    * With the exception of a few marginal detections at <3sigma, we could only infer upper limits, both on individual sources and on the stacks.
    * This analysis confirms the passive nature of 9 candidates with high confidence and suggests that the classification is correct for at least half of the sample in a statistical sense. For the remaining sources the analysis remain inconclusive because available ALMA data is not deep enough

#### [Alignment between filaments and galaxy spins from the MaNGA integral-field survey](https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.09797)
    * 星系和halo角动量与大尺度filament的关系：Low mass halos grow by accretion onto filaments, aligning their spins with the filaments, whereas high mass halos grow by mergers along filaments, generating spins perpendicular to the filament.
    * MaNGA produces a map of the galaxy's rotational velocity, allowing direct measurement of the galaxy's spin direction, or unit angular momentum vector projected onto the sky. 但没有看到和大尺度filament之间的相关


#### [A reference sample of face-on bulgeless galaxies](https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.09892)
    * We present a list of 220 face-on, almost bulgeless galaxies assumed to be counterparts to the objects from the Reference Flat Galaxy Catalog (RFGC).
    * About half of them have bar-like structures occurring in the whole range of the absolute magnitudes of galaxies
    * An essential part of our sample (27-50%) exhibit distorted spiral patterns


#### [Investigating the Candidate Displaced Active Galactic Nucleus in NGC 3115](https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.10011)
    * NGC3115 was recently claimed to host a candidate AGN displaced 14.3 pc from the galaxy's optical photocenter. Our goal is to understand whether this represents a single offset AGN
    * 新的10GHz观测：finds evidence for only one AGN.
    * This provides an argument against a single offset AGN in NGC 3115, however does not provide conclusive evidence against the purported offset AGN as an in-spiralling secondary black hole.

#### [Highly Magnified Stars in Lensing Clusters: New Evidence in a Galaxy Lensed by MACS J0416.1-2403](https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.10090)
    * We examine a caustic-straddling arc at z=0.9397 in the field of the galaxy cluster MACS J0416.1-2403 (z=0.397) using archival multiband HST images and show that its surface brightness exhibits anomalies that can be explained by a single highly magnified star undergoing microlensing.
    * We extend this study to a statistical analysis of the whole arc image and find tentative evidence of the increased mismatch of the two images in the proximity of the critical line. Robust detection of one or multiple caustic-transiting stars in this arc will enable detailed follow-up studies that can shed light on the small-scale structure of the dark matter inside the cluster halo.

#### [Tidal Disruption Event Disks around Supermassive Black Holes: Disk Warp and Inclination Evolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.09546)
    * After the Tidal Disruption Event (TDE) of a star around a SuperMassive Black Hole (SMBH), the bound stellar debris rapidly forms an accretion disk. If the accretion disk is not aligned with the spinning SMBH's equatorial plane, the disk will be driven into Lense-Thirring precession around the SMBH's spin axis, possibly affecting the TDE's light curve.

#### [High gas fraction in a CO-selected main-sequence galaxy at z>3](https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.10143)
    * NOEMA observations of warm molecular gas traced by CO(5−4) in a z∼3.2 gas-rich main-sequence galaxy (MS) 气体性质和z~1.5的MS差不多，但分子气体比例高很多
    * Our results are consistent with recent findings by the COLDz and ASPECS molecular line scan surveys and suggest that deep searches for CO emission are a powerful means to identify gas-rich, star-forming galaxies at high redshift.


#### [The COS CGM Compendium. III: Metallicity and Physical Properties of the Cool Circumgalactic Medium at z<1](https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.10147)
    * We characterize the metallicities and physical properties of cool, photoionized gas in a sample of 152 z<1 strong Lyα forest systems
    * We show that the metallicity probability distribution function (PDF) of the SLFSs at z< 1 is unimodal, skewed to low metallicities with a mean and median of [X/H] = -1.44 and -1.16 dex
    * 非常贫金属的气体占了一半以上的SLFS系统：there are important reservoirs of primitive (though not pristine) gas around z< 1 galaxies.
    * The photoionized gas around z<1 galaxies is highly inhomogeneous based on the wide range of metallicities observed

#### [Dust extinction, dust emission, and dust temperature in galaxies at z>=5: a view from the FIRE-2 simulations](https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.10152)
    * FIRE模拟：a suite of 34 high-resolution cosmological zoom-in simulations consisting of thousands of halos up to M_halo~10^12 M_sun (M_star~10^10.5 M_sun) at z>=5 
    * 3D-MC辐射转移看尘埃： forms a tight correlation between infrared excess (IRX=F_IR/F_UV) and ultraviolet (UV)-continuum slope (beta_UV), despite the patchy, clumpy dust geometry shown in our simulations.
    * We find that the IRX-beta_UV relation is mainly determined by the shape of the extinction curve and is independent of its normalization
    * The bolometric IR luminosity (L_IR) correlates with the intrinsic UV luminosity and the star formation rate (SFR) averaged over the past 10 Myr.
    * 高红移尘埃温度高，IR尘埃辐射的波长peak更短; 高温是高红移处提高的sSFR和SFR密度造成的

#### [The dichotomy of dark matter fraction and total mass density slope of galaxies over five dex in mass](https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.10158)
    * SPARC样本：We show that lower-mass spiral galaxies are more dark matter dominated and have more shallow mass density slopes when compared with more massive galaxies, which have density profiles closer to isothermal at one effective radius.
    * With increasing galaxy mass, the values of fDM decreases and the mass density profiles steepen. In the most massive late-type gas-poor galaxies, a possible flattening of these trends is noticed. 
    * 和ETG相比，这个trend是相反的，ETG是质量越高，fDM越高
    * These trends with M∗ can be understood in the context of differential feedback efficiency by supernovae in low-mass galaxies, and by galaxy mergers, AGN feedback or halo mass quenching in higher-mass galaxies.

#### [A New Diagnostic to Separate Line Emission from Star Formation, Shocks, and AGN Simultaneously in IFU Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.10295)
    * We present a new three-dimensional diagnostic diagram for IFU data which can simultaneously separate the line emission amongst star formation, shocks, and AGN within a galaxy.
    * spaxels defined as shock-dominated correlate strongly with regions of high velocity dispersion within the galaxy.

#### [X-ray binaries as the origin of nebular HeII emission in low-metallicity star-forming galaxies](https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.10496)
    - **Interesting**
    * Using the observed anticorrelation of the integrated X-ray luminosity per unit of star formation rate (LX/SFR) of an X-ray binary population with metallicity and other empirical data from the well-studied galaxy I Zw 18, we show that the observed HeII 4686 intensity and its trend with metallicity is naturally reproduced if the bulk of He+ ionizing photons are emitted by the X-ray sources
    * We conclude that both empirical data and theoretical models suggest that high-mass X-ray binaries are the main source of nebular HeII emission in low-metallicity star-forming galaxies.
