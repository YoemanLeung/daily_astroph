#### [An Absence of Radio-Loud Active Galactic Nuclei in Geometrically Flat Quiescent Galaxies: Implications for Maintenance-Mode Feedback Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.00515)
    * We demonstrate that at a fixed mass the incidence of radio-loud AGN identified in the FIRST and NVSS radio surveys among a large sample of quiescent (non-star forming) galaxies selected from the SDSS is much higher in geometrically round galaxies than in geometrically flat, disk-like galaxies.
    * 在固定的速度弥散度和恒星质量上也是如此; 而且不能用投影效应解释
    * The large fraction of radio-loud AGN in massive, round galaxies is consistent with the hypothesis that such AGN deposit energy into their hot gaseous halos, preventing cooling and star-formation.
    * the absence of such AGN in disk-like quiescent galaxies -- most of which are not satellites in massive clusters, raises important questions: is maintenance-mode feedback a generally valid explanation for quiescence;


#### [Diffuse polarized emission in the LOFAR Two-meter Sky Survey](https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.00531)
    * 用Faraday tomography方法刻画银河系的弥散偏振同步加速辐射：Faraday depth cube mosaic covering 568 square degrees at high Galactic latitudes
    * We observed many new polarization features, some up to 15 degrees in length. These include two regions with very uniformly structured, linear gradients in the Faraday depth 
    * We also observed a relationship between one of the gradients and an HI filament in the local ISM. Other ISM tracers were also checked for correlations with our polarization data and none were found, but very little signal was seen in most tracers in this region


#### [Searching for Dual AGN in Galaxies with Double-Peaked Emission Line Spectra using Radio Observations](https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.00689)
    * One of the best ways to confirm dual/binary AGN in double-peaked AGN (DPAGN) is by using high resolution radio observations.
    * 用VLA检查已知的DP-AGN：We have detected dual radio structures at separation of ≲ 10 kpc in three of our sample galaxies. Using the spectral index maps and optical spectra of the sources, we have confirmed that one of them is a dual AGN (DAGN), while the other two can be dual AGN or AGN+ star-forming nuclei pairs.
    * The remaining 13 sources are single cores while one source is not detected at any frequency. We find that for our dual AGN detection, the DPAGN emission lines do not originate from the dual/binary AGN. Instead, they could be due to outflows or jets


#### [An intuitive 3D map of the Galactic warp's precession traced by classical Cepheids](https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.00998)
    * Here, we establish a robust Galactic disk model based on 1339 classical Cepheids. We provide strong evidence that the warp's line of nodes is not oriented in the Galactic Center-Sun direction.
    * Our Galaxy thus follows Briggs' rule for spiral galaxies, which suggests that the origin of the warp is associated with torques forced by the massive inner disk. The stellar disk traced by Cepheids follows the gas disk in terms of their amplitudes; the stellar disk extends to at least 20 kpc.


#### [The erratic dynamical life of black hole seeds in high-redshift galaxies](https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.01297)
    * To properly follow the dynamics of black holes we develop a physically motivated model to capture unresolved dynamical friction from stars, dark matter and gas
    * We first explore the dynamics of a seed black hole in the galaxy where it is born and show that it is highly erratic if the seed mass is less than 10^5M⊙.
    * The dynamics is dominated by the stellar component, whose distribution is irregular and patchy, thus inducing stochasticity in the orbits: the black hole may be anywhere in the proto-galaxy.

#### [Hunting for Galaxies and Halos in simulations with VELOCIraptor](https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.01010)
    * A massively parallel galaxy/(sub)halo finder that is also capable of robustly identifying tidally disrupted objects and separate stellar halos from galaxies 
    * It can identify subhalos deep within the host that have negligible density contrasts to their parent halo.
    * We find a subhalo mass-radial distance dependence: large subhalos with mass ratios of ≳10−2 are more common in the central regions that smaller subhalos, a result of dynamical friction and low tidal mass loss rates. 其他的halo finder找不到这个关系

#### [Metallicity calibrations for diffuse ionised gas and low ionisation emission regions](https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.01401)


#### [Yule-Simpson's paradox in Galactic Archaeology](https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.01421)
    - **Interesting**
    * Simpson's paradox, or the Yule-Simpson effect, arises when a trend appears in different subsets of data but disappears or reverses when these subsets are combined.
    * We describe here seven cases of this phenomenon for chemo-kinematical relations believed to constrain the Milky Way disk formation and evolution. We show that interpreting trends in relations, such as the radial and vertical chemical abundance gradients, the age-metallicity relation, and the metallicity-rotational velocity relation (MVR), can lead to conflicting conclusions about the Galaxy past if analyses marginalize over stellar age and/or birth radius.
    * This work highlights the necessity for precise age estimates for large stellar samples covering wide spatial regions.


#### [Constraints on high-J CO emission lines in z∼6 quasars](https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.01413)
    * ALMA观测：The continuum emission of both quasars arises from a compact region (<0.9 kpc) of the host galaxy
    * Only CO(8-7) and CO(9-8) in J2310 are detected, while 3σ upper limits on luminosities are reported for the other lines of both quasars
    * The CO line luminosities and upper limits measured in J2310 and J1319 are consistent with those observed in local AGN and starburst galaxies, and other z ∼ 6 quasars, except for SDSS J1148+5251 (J1148), the only quasar at z = 6.4 with a previous CO(17-16) line detection


#### [A Large Catalog of Accurate Distances to Local Molecular Clouds: The Gaia DR2 Edition](https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.01425)
    - **Interesting, 有Josh**
    * We infer the distance and extinction to stars along sightlines towards the clouds using optical and near-infrared photometry.
    * When available, we incorporate knowledge of the stellar distances obtained from Gaia DR2 parallax measurements. We model these per-star distance-extinction estimates as being caused by a dust screen with a 2-D morphology derived from Planck at an unknown distance, which we then fit for using a nested sampling algorithm.


#### [New constraints on red-spiral galaxies from their kinematics in clusters of galaxies](https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.01427)
    * We find that the probability distribution function of the pairwise line-of-sight velocity vlos between red-spiral galaxies and galaxy clusters has a dip at vlos = 0, which is a very odd feature, at 93% confidence level.
    * We adopt a two component model that consists of the infall component, which corresponds to galaxies that are now falling into galaxy clusters, and the splash- back component, which corresponds to galaxies that are on their first (or more) orbit after falling into galaxy clusters.
    * red-spiral galaxies reside predominantly in the infall component, regardless of the choice of the functional form of their spatial distribution. Our results constrain the quenching timescale of red-spiral galaxies to a few Gyrs,


#### [Radio Source Extraction with ProFound](https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.01440)
    * Typical radio source extraction software generates catalogues by using Gaussian components to form a model of the emission. This may not be well suited to complicated jet structures and extended emission
    * We find that ProFound can accurately recover both the flux densities of simulated Gaussian sources as well as extended radio galaxies. ProFound can create models that trace the complicated nature of these extended galaxies, which we show is not necessarily the case with other source extraction software.


#### [The Escape Fraction of Ionizing Photons During the Epoch of Reionization: Observability with the Square Kilometre Array](https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.01611)
    * we present such a model (is self-consistently coupled to galaxy evolution) and explore how physically motivated functional forms of fesc affect the evolution of ionized hydrogen within the intergalactic medium
    * Using the 21cm power spectrum evolution, we investigate the likelihood of observationally distinguishing between a constant fesc and other models that depend upon different forms of galaxy feedback. We find that changing the underlying connection between fesc and galaxy feedback drastically alters the large-scale 21cm power.
    * SKA 200  hours of integration time focused on redshift z=7.5−8.5可以把fesc限制好.


#### [What shapes a galaxy? - Unraveling the role of mass, environment and star formation in forming galactic structure](https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.01665)
    - **Relevant**
    * We utilise bulge-to-total stellar mass ratio, (B/T)_*, as the primary indicator of galactic structure, which circumvents issues of morphological dependence on waveband.
    * We rank galaxy and environmental parameters in terms of how predictive they are of galaxy structure, using an artificial neural network approach. We find that distance from the star forming main sequence (Delta_SFR), followed by stellar mass (M_*), are the most closely connected parameters to (B/T)_*
    * In both simulations (Illustris & L-Galaxies SAM), we find a significant lack of bulge-dominated galaxies at a fixed stellar mass, compared to the SDSS.


#### [Low-redshift lowest-metallicity star-forming galaxies in the SDSS DR14](https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.01775)
    - **Interesting, Relevant**
    * We present a sample of low-redshift (z < 0.133) candidates for extremely low-metallicity star-forming galaxies with oxygen abun- dances 12 + logO/H < 7.4 selected from the Data Release 14 (DR14)
    * 发展了一个专门估计贫金属星系气体丰度的强线判据
    * In total, our list of selected candidates for extremely low-metallicity galaxies includes 66 objects.
