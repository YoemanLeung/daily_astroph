    * 61 nucleated dwarf galaxies in the central regions (􏰘 Rvir/4) of the Fornax galaxy cluster.
    * In general, nuclei are consistent with colors of confirmed metal-poor globular clusters, but with significantly smaller dispersion than other confirmed compact stellar systems in Fornax.
    * We find a bimodal nucleus mass distribution with peaks located at log(M∗/M⊙)≃5.4 and ∼ 6.3. These two nucleus sub-populations have different stellar population properties, the more massive nuclei are older than ∼ 2 Gyr and have metal-poor stellar populations (Z ≤ 0.02 Z⊙), while the less massive nuclei are younger than ∼ 2 Gyr with metallicities in the range 0.02 < Z/Z⊙ ≤ 1.

#### [On the Transition of the Galaxy Quenching Mode at 0.5<z<1 in CANDELS](https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.00595)

    * 对比有AGN和no-AGN feedback的模拟
    * Our MrAGN model launches galactic outflows which result in both “ejective” feedback — the outflows themselves which drive gas out of galaxies — and “preventative” feedback, which suppresses the inflow of new and recycling gas.
    * The histories of NoAGN galaxies are recycling-dominated, with ∼ 70% of material that leaves the galaxy eventually returning, and the majority of outflowing gas re-accretes on 1 Gyr timescales without AGN feedback.

#### [Unbiased clustering estimates with the DESI fibre assignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.00951)
    * Clustering of samples constructed using a limited number of passes will be strongly affected by missing targets.
    * The effect of missing galaxies can be corrected when calculating the correlation function using a weighting scheme for pairs
    * On BAO scales, we find that the error is a factor 2 worse after one pass, but that after three or more passes, the errors are very similar.

    - **Interesting**
    * We find that the range of UV upturn strengths in the population as a whole has not declined over the past 2.2 Gyrs. This is consistent with a model where hot horizontal branch stars, produced by a Helium-enriched population, provide the required UV flux.
    * Helium abundances of at least 1.5 times the primor- dial value for this HB population
    * 作者认为来自贫金属星的可能可以排除，但是富金属只是对平均星族而言

    * We find that the interstellar medium seen in absorption is dominated by outflowing material
    * Mass loss rates in the low ionization phase are comparable to or in excess of the star formation rate, with total outflow rates likely higher when accounting for ionized gas.
    * Gas phase Si abundances are significantly super-solar relative to Fe and Ni ([Si/Fe]~0.4), indicating a combination of α-enhancement and dust depletion.


#### [50% of Quasar Outflows are Situated at Least 100 Parsecs From the Central Source](https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.01543)
    * Our results show that Siv absorption is only detected in 25% of Civ BAL outflows. The smaller detection fraction is due to the higher total column density (NH) needed to detect Siv absorption.
    * We find that at least 50% of quasar outflows are at distances larger than 100 pc from the central source, and at least 12% are at distances larger than 1000 pc.

    * S iv and S iv* troughs, whose ratio can be used to determine the distance of the outflows from the central source (R)
    * At least two of the outflows have a kinetic luminosity greater than 0.5% of their Eddington luminosity, implying that they are able to provide significant AGN feedback.
    * most of these outflows are situated far away from the AGN accretion disk; and that a significant portion of them can contribute to AGN feedback processes.


#### [A Mini-BAL Outflow at 900 pc from the Central Source: VLT/X-shooter Observations](https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.01545)

#### [The origin of the mid-infrared nuclear polarization of active galactic nuclei](https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.01899)
    * For all radio quiet objects, we found that the nuclear polarization is low (< 1 per cent).
    * Only the radio-loud Cygnus A exhibits significant nuclear polarization (∼11 per cent), attributable to synchrotron emission from the pc-scale jet close to the core. 
    * For highly obscured objects arises from a self-absorbed MIR polarized clumpy torus and/or dichroism from the host galaxy, while for unabsorbed cores, MIR polarization arises from dust scattering in the torus and/or surrounding nuclear dust.

        - 所以z~1的SF星系的z~2前身可能质量要小很多 
    * we show that the current SF activity of massive galaxies (> L∗ ) at z ∼ 1 correlates with SF levels at least 3 Gyrs prior: SFHs retain ‘memory’ on a large fraction of the Hubble time.

#### [Quantifying the AGN-driven outflows in ULIRGs (QUADROS) III: Measurements of the radii and kinetic powers of 8 near-nuclear outflows](https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.02647)

    - by Yanxia Xie & Luis Ho
    * Decompose the emission features of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) from mid-infrared spectra using theoretical PAH templates in conjunction with modified blackbody components for the dust continuum and an extinction term.
    * In addition to providing accurate measurements of the PAH emission, including upper limits thereof, our fits can reproduce reasonably well the overall continuum shape and constrain the line-of-sight extinction


#### [Three dynamically distinct stellar populations in the halo of M49](https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.03092)
    - **Relevant, Interesting**
    * We study the position-velocity-plane for bright and faint PN populations out to 95 kpc radius, and employ a multi-Gaussian model for the velocity distribution to identify stellar populations with distinct kinematics and histories.
    * We find two kinematically distinct PN populations associated with the main M49 halo and the extended intra-group light (IGL).
    * The blue colours of the IGL component are consistent with a population of stars formed in low-mass galaxies at redshift ∼ 0.5 that has since evolved passively, as suggested by other data.

    * we derive the mass-to-light ratio vs. colour relation (MLCR) both for quiescent and star-forming galaxies.
    * The rest-frame i−band mass-to-light ratio of quiescent and star-forming galaxies presents a tight correlation with the rest-frame (g − i) colour up to z = 1.5. Such MLCR is linear for quiescent galaxies and quadratic for star-forming galaxies.
    * The derived MLCRs do not present a significant redshift evolution and are compatible with previous local results in the literature. Finally, these tight relations also hold for g− and r−band luminosities.

#### [The formation and hierarchical assembly of globular cluster populations](https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.03652)
    - **Interesting**
    * Many previous works have argued that the observed linear relation between total GC mass and halo mass points to a fundamental GC – dark matter connection or indicates that GCs formed at very high redshift before feedback processes introduced nonlinearity in the baryon-to-dark matter mass relation
    * Constant mass ratio来自中心极限定理：by the central limit theorem, it is expected at z = 0 independent of the GC-to-halo mass relation at the time of GC formation.
    * It predicts that the cosmic GC formation rate peaked at z ∼ 4, too late for GCs to contribute significantly to the UV luminosity density during reionization.

    * The mass outflow rates are 12 − 400 M⊙ yr−1 and the inclination corrected average velocity of the outflowing gas 350 − 550 km s−1 (vmax = 500 − 900 km s−1 ). The origin of these outflows can be explained by the strong nuclear starbursts although the contribution of an obscured AGN can not be completely ruled out.
    * The outflow depletion times are 15 − 80 Myr.
    * The majority of the outflowing gas will return to the disk after 5 − 10 Myr and become available to form new stars.

#### [The Dearth of Difference between Central and Satellite Galaxies I. Perspectives on star formation quenching and AGN activities](https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.04004)

        - In a magnetized, weakly collisional plasma, such as the ICM, anisotropic thermal conduction (ATC) is the relevant heat transport process, with heat transport perpendicular to the magnetic field suppressed.


#### [Late Bloomer Galaxies: Growing Up in Cosmic Autumn](https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.04110)
    - **Interesting**
    * CSI里挑选的在过去2Gyr里形成大部分恒星的大质量星系，做了专门的SFH重构测试
    * Late bloomers account for ∼20% of z ∼ 0.6 galaxies with masses of the modern Milky Way, with a moderate dependence on mass.
    * At galaxies with both old and young SFHs cover the full range of morphology and environment (excluding rich groups or clusters), albeit with a mild but suggestive correlation with local environment.

    * Find a strong rotation signal: 和stellar rotation的方向不一致
    * About a half of the GCs are an intermediate-age population of which the mean age is ∼ 3.7 ± 1.9 Gyr, having a mean [Fe/H] value of –0.26. The other half are old and metal-poor.


#### [Discovery of the most ultra-luminous QSO using Gaia, SkyMapper and WISE](https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.04317)
    * Discovery of the ultra-luminous QSO SMSS J215728.21-360215.1 with magnitude z = 16.9 and W4= 7.42 at redshift 4.75
    * With the highest unlensed UV-optical luminosity currently known in the Universe. 
    * It is classed as a weak-emission-line QSO and possesses broad absorption line features.


#### [Integrated-light analyses vs. colour-magnitude diagrams - II. Leo A, an extremely young dwarf in the Local Group](https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.04323)
    - **Relevant, Useful**
    * We have used GTC/OSIRIS in long-slit mode to obtain a high-quality integrated light spectrum by scanning a selected region within Leo A, for which a CMD reaching the old main mequence turn-off (oMSTO) is available from HST. 符合得很好
    * The analysis of high S/N spectra seems to provide more reliable SFH estimates than that of CMDs not reaching the oMSTO. 


#### [Evolution of the Outflows in NGC 3516](https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.04406)

#### [Simulations of the flocculent spiral M33: what drives the spiral structure?](https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.04443)
    * We find that gravitational instabilities in the stars and gas are able to reproduce the observed spiral pattern and velocity field of M33, as seen in HI, and no interaction is required.
    * The gas component appears to have a significant role in producing the structure, so if there is little feedback, both the gas and stars organise into clear spiral arms, likely due to a lower combined Q

#### [Simulating galactic dust grain evolution on a moving mesh](https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.04521)
    * We employ a particle-based method for dust subject to dynamical forces including drag and gravity. The drag force is implemented using a second-order semi-implicit integrator and validated using several dust-hydrodynamical test problems
    * The grain size distribution is discretised with a second-order piecewise linear method and evolves in time according to various dust physi- cal processes, including accretion, sputtering, shattering, and coagulation.


#### [PLCK G165.7+67.0: A New Massive Lensing Cluster Discovered in an HST Census of Sub-Millimeter Giant Arcs Selected Using Planck/Herschel](https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.04790)
    - **Interesting**
    * HST WFC3-NIR imaging in the fields of six strongly-lensed Dusty Star Forming Galaxies (DSFGs) at z=2-4 identified by color and compactness through a new method of discovering massive lensing clusters
    * The red and spatially-extended lensed DSFG in G165 bisects the critical curve, incurring a high magnification factor of >∼30 and producing a counter-image that is detected in our new longer wavelength ground- and space-based imaging data
    * PKCK G165.7+67.0 at z=0.351: high dark matter concentration, relatively weak X-ray flux and low SZ decrement may potentially be explained as a pre-merger for which the intracluster gas is diluted while the surface mass densities integrated along the line-of-sight remains supercritical to strong lensing effects.


#### [The disk averaged star formation relation for Local Volume dwarf galaxies](https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.05003)
    * We therefore explore a method for estimating the surface density of the atomic gas from global H i parameters
    * Find that our approximation produces values for the surface density of atomic hydrogen within typically 0.5 dex of the true value.


#### [HST followup observations of two bright z ~ 8 candidate galaxies from the BoRG pure-parallel survey](https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.05038)
    * Our results confirm one galaxy, BoRG 0116+1425 747, as a highly probable z ∼ 8 source, but reveal that BoRG 0116+1425 630 - previously the brightest known z > 8 candidate (mAB = 24.5) - is likely to be a z ∼ 2 interloper.
    * We show that while previous BoRG results favored a shallow power-law decline in the bright end of the luminosity function prior to reionization, there is now no evidence for departure from a Schechter function form and therefore no evidence for a difference in galaxy formation processes before and after reionization.


#### [A Likely Super Massive Black Hole Revealed by its Einstein Radius in Hubble Frontier Fields Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.05051)
    - **Interesting**
    * Here, we directly measure the mass of a SMBH in the brightest cluster galaxy (BCG) of MACS J1149+2223.5 at z = 0.54 through one of the multiply-lensed images of a background spiral galaxy at z = 1.49 projected close to the BCG
    * An intrinsically compact region in one of the spiral arms is lensed into an arc that curves towards the BCG center. Crucially, this arc has a radius of curvature of only ∼0".6, betraying the presence of a local compact deflector.
    * The SMBH is noticeably offset by 4.4±0.3 kpc from the BCG light centre, plausibly the result of a kick imparted ∼ 2.9×107 years ago during the merger of two SMBHs, placing it just beyond the stellar core.


#### [The clustering of galaxies with pseudo bulge and classical bulge in the local Universe](https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.05063)
    - **Relevant, Interesting**
    * Simard+2011的经典核球和伪核球星系
    * We find that, when limited to a certain stellar mass range and matched in color and concentration, all the samples present similar clustering amplitudes and neighbour counts on scales above ∼ 0.1h−1Mpc.
    * On smaller scales, in contrast, pseudo-bulge and pure-disk galaxies similarly show strong excess in close neighbour count when compared to control galaxies, at all masses probed.
    * These results imply strong connections between galactic bulges and galaxy-galaxy interactions in the local Universe, although it is unclear how they are physically linked in the current theory of galaxy formation.


#### [Recoiling supermassive black hole in changing-look AGN Mrk 1018](https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.05251)
    * The spectral type of Mrk 1018 changed from Type 1.9 to 1 and returned back to 1.9 over a period of 40 years.
    * Two kinematically distinct broad-line components, blueshifted and redshifted components, are found from spectral decomposition. 速度差别变化有明显的pattern
    * An oscillating recoiled supermassive black hole (rSMBH) scenario is proposed to explain the observed velocity offset in broad emission lines.
    * Perturbations of the accretion disk caused by pericentric passage can reasonably explain the AGN activity and spectral change in Mrk 1018.
