#### [The Next Generation Fornax Survey (NGFS): IV. Mass and Age Bimodality of Nuclear Clusters in the Fornax Core Region](https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.00491)
    - **Relevant**
    * 61 nucleated dwarf galaxies in the central regions (􏰘 Rvir/4) of the Fornax galaxy cluster.
    * In general, nuclei are consistent with colors of confirmed metal-poor globular clusters, but with significantly smaller dispersion than other confirmed compact stellar systems in Fornax.
    * We find a bimodal nucleus mass distribution with peaks located at log(M∗/M⊙)≃5.4 and ∼ 6.3. These two nucleus sub-populations have different stellar population properties, the more massive nuclei are older than ∼ 2 Gyr and have metal-poor stellar populations (Z ≤ 0.02 Z⊙), while the less massive nuclei are younger than ∼ 2 Gyr with metallicities in the range 0.02 < Z/Z⊙ ≤ 1.
    * A likely mixture of in-situ star formation and star-cluster mergers seem to be acting during nucleus growth over cosmic time.


#### [Structural properties of faint low surface brightness galaxies](https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.00499)

#### [Quantifying the AGN-driven outflows in ULIRGs (QUADROS) II: evidence for compact outflow regions from HST [OIII] imaging observations](https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.00514)
    * 外流的空间范围可以看AGN feedback是不是galaxy-wide的
    * 8个有AGN core的ULIRGS: the HST images show that the warm gas outflows are relatively compact for most of the objects in the sample: in three objects the outflow regions are barely resolved at the resolution of HST 


#### [On the Transition of the Galaxy Quenching Mode at 0.5<z<1 in CANDELS](https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.00595)
    - Liu Fei-Shan
    * On average both star-forming and transition galaxies at all masses are not fully quenched at any radii, whereas quiescent galaxies are fully quenched at all radii.
    * 用颜色梯度infer sSFR梯度：In other words, our findings support that internal processes dominate the quenching of massive galaxies, whereas external processes dominate the quenching of low-mass galaxies.

#### [Studying galaxy troughs and ridges using Weak Gravitational Lensing with the Kilo-Degree Survey](https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.00562)
    * We quantify their lensing strength A as a function of galaxy density percentile rank P and overdensity δ, and find that the skewness in the galaxy density distribution is reflected in the total mass distribution measured by weak lensing.
    * Using the MICE and SLICS mocks we predict that trough and ridge evolution could be detected with gravitational lensing using deeper and wider lensing surveys

## May 3:

#### [Cloud-Scale Molecular Gas Properties in 15 Nearby Galaxies](https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.00937)
    - **Interesting; Sun Jia-Yi**
    * 45-120pc resolution, 30000 sightlines of ALMA 
    * Surface density and velocity dispersion show strong positive correlation; 基本符合resolved, self-gravitating clouds的预期
    * Observe enormous variation in the internal turbulent pressure
    * We find Σ, σ, and Pturb to be systematically larger in more massive galaxies. The same quantities appear enhanced in the central kpc of strongly barred galaxies relative to their disks.


#### [Can we improve CIV-based single epoch black hole mass estimations?](https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.00942)
    * Our results show that optical C IV-based mass estimates at high redshift cannot be a proper replacement for estimates based on IR spectroscopy of low ionization lines like Hα, Hβ and MgII.


#### [Momentum-driven Winds from Radiatively Efficient Black Hole Accretion and Their Impact on Galaxies](https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.00946)
    * 对比有AGN和no-AGN feedback的模拟
    * Our MrAGN model launches galactic outflows which result in both “ejective” feedback — the outflows themselves which drive gas out of galaxies — and “preventative” feedback, which suppresses the inflow of new and recycling gas.
    * The histories of NoAGN galaxies are recycling-dominated, with ∼ 70% of material that leaves the galaxy eventually returning, and the majority of outflowing gas re-accretes on 1 Gyr timescales without AGN feedback.


#### [Formation of ultra-compact dwarf galaxies from supergiant molecular clouds](https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.01071)
    - **Relevant**

#### [Correlation between centre offsets and gas velocity dispersion of galaxy clusters in cosmological simulations](https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.01165)
    * The spatial offsets of gas centre from the halo centre could be an indicator of the dynamical state of cluster
    * Halos at higher redshifts tend to have larger values of rescaled offsets roff /r200 and larger gas velocity dispersion σgas/σ .
    * 提供了一个 r_off/r200和气体速度弥散度关系的函数形式


#### [Unbiased clustering estimates with the DESI fibre assignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.00951)
    * Clustering of samples constructed using a limited number of passes will be strongly affected by missing targets.
    * The effect of missing galaxies can be corrected when calculating the correlation function using a weighting scheme for pairs
    * On BAO scales, we find that the error is a factor 2 worse after one pass, but that after three or more passes, the errors are very similar.


#### [Statistical separation of weak gravitational lensing and intrinsic ellipticities based on galaxy colour information](https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.01240)
    * find linear combinations of measured ellipticity correlation functions which suppress the gravitational lensing signal completely or which show a strongly boosted gravitational lensing signal relative to intrinsic alignments.
    * Assumptions: 1) the large-scale structure follows Gaussian statistics on large scales, 2) intrinsic shapes of elliptical galaxies follows the linear tidal shearing model, 3) intrinsic shapes of spiral galaxies follows the quadratic tidal torquing model

## May 6:

#### [A Population of Bona Fide Intermediate Mass Black Holes Identified as Low Luminosity Active Galactic Nuclei](https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.01467)
    * we identified a sample of 305 IMBH candidates having masses 3 × 10^4 < MBH < 2 × 10^5M⊙, which reside in galaxy centers and are accreting gas that creates characteristic signatures of a type I active galactic nucleus (AGN).

    * 不能简单的用dwarf的动力学质量估计来估计总质量或者暗物质比例


#### [Evolution of the UV upturn in cluster galaxies: Abell 1689](https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.01472)
    - **Interesting**
    * We find that the range of UV upturn strengths in the population as a whole has not declined over the past 2.2 Gyrs. This is consistent with a model where hot horizontal branch stars, produced by a Helium-enriched population, provide the required UV flux.
    * Helium abundances of at least 1.5 times the primor- dial value for this HB population
    * 作者认为来自贫金属星的可能可以排除，但是富金属只是对平均星族而言
        - UV upturn在越大质量的星系里越明显，作者认为这是排除了贫金属星的证据，但越大质量的椭圆星系里，来自并合的贫金属星也越多


#### [The abundances and properties of Dual AGN and their host galaxies in the EAGLE simulations](https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.01479)
    * 30kpc内的AGN pair算dual-AGN，在光度比较高的范围里，比例非常低
    * 主要由于在星系和黑洞并合期间的快速光变，同时是AGN的时间短
    * 能观测到的Dual-AGN比例随红移升高


#### [Dust in the Wind: Composition and Kinematics of Galaxy Outflows at the Peak Epoch of Star Formation](https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.01484)
    * We find that the interstellar medium seen in absorption is dominated by outflowing material
    * Mass loss rates in the low ionization phase are comparable to or in excess of the star formation rate, with total outflow rates likely higher when accounting for ionized gas.
    * Gas phase Si abundances are significantly super-solar relative to Fe and Ni ([Si/Fe]~0.4), indicating a combination of α-enhancement and dust depletion.


#### [50% of Quasar Outflows are Situated at Least 100 Parsecs From the Central Source](https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.01543)
    * Our results show that Siv absorption is only detected in 25% of Civ BAL outflows. The smaller detection fraction is due to the higher total column density (NH) needed to detect Siv absorption.
    * We find that at least 50% of quasar outflows are at distances larger than 100 pc from the central source, and at least 12% are at distances larger than 1000 pc.


#### [VLT/X-Shooter Survey of BAL Quasars: Large Distance Scale and AGN Feedback](https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.01544)
    * S iv and S iv* troughs, whose ratio can be used to determine the distance of the outflows from the central source (R)
    * At least two of the outflows have a kinetic luminosity greater than 0.5% of their Eddington luminosity, implying that they are able to provide significant AGN feedback.
    * most of these outflows are situated far away from the AGN accretion disk; and that a significant portion of them can contribute to AGN feedback processes.


#### [A Mini-BAL Outflow at 900 pc from the Central Source: VLT/X-shooter Observations](https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.01545)
    * The main outflow component spans the velocity range −1500 to −3000 km s−1 and has detected absorption troughs from both high-ionization species: C iv, N v, O vi, Si iv, P v, and S iv
    * low-ionization species: H i, C ii, Mg ii, Al ii, Al iii, Si ii, and Si iii
    * 从这些光谱信息里可以拟合光致电离模型，得到H柱密度和电离参数，电子密度,以及电离气体到中心电离源的距离
        - 这个距离很重要，一般在几pc到几十kpc之间；高光度QSO大多数在几百到几千pc之间
        - 但之前主要是用singly ionized元素来定距离，有model dependence


#### [Galaxy Zoo: constraining the origin of spiral arms](https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.01782)
    * Swing amplification theory with respect to directly measured spiral arm numbers from Galaxy Zoo 2
    * Neither a universal cored or cuspy inner dark matter profile can correctly predict observed numbers of arms in galaxies.
    * Approximately 40 per cent of unbarred spiral galaxies at z   0.1 and M∗   1010M⊙ have spiral arms that can be modelled by swing amplification.
    * 剩下的都是2-arm system，可以用tidal interactions来解释

## May 7:

#### [The origin of the mid-infrared nuclear polarization of active galactic nuclei](https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.01899)
    * For all radio quiet objects, we found that the nuclear polarization is low (< 1 per cent).
    * Only the radio-loud Cygnus A exhibits significant nuclear polarization (∼11 per cent), attributable to synchrotron emission from the pc-scale jet close to the core. 
    * For highly obscured objects arises from a self-absorbed MIR polarized clumpy torus and/or dichroism from the host galaxy, while for unabsorbed cores, MIR polarization arises from dust scattering in the torus and/or surrounding nuclear dust.


#### [First evidence of diffuse ultra-steep-spectrum radio emission surrounding the cool core of a cluster](https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.01900)
    * First discovery of a cool-core cluster with an associated mini halo that also shows ultra-steep-spectrum emission extending well beyond the core that resembles radio halo emission
    * the steep-spectrum radio emission outside the core could be produced by a minor merger that powers electron re-acceleration without disrupting the cool core.
