    * HSC 观测griz和窄波段，覆盖了30 deg^2
    * The five ultraluminous LAEs have wider line profiles than lower luminosity LAEs, and one source, NEPLA4, has a complex line profile similar to that of COLA1.
    * line profiles of the z = 6.6 ultraluminous LAEs are systematically different from those of lower luminosity LAEs at this redshift.


#### [The Next Generation Fornax Survey (NGFS): IV. Mass and Age Bimodality of Nuclear Clusters in the Fornax Core Region](https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.00491)
    - **Relevant**
    * 61 nucleated dwarf galaxies in the central regions (􏰘 Rvir/4) of the Fornax galaxy cluster.
    * In general, nuclei are consistent with colors of confirmed metal-poor globular clusters, but with significantly smaller dispersion than other confirmed compact stellar systems in Fornax.
    * We find a bimodal nucleus mass distribution with peaks located at log(M∗/M⊙)≃5.4 and ∼ 6.3. These two nucleus sub-populations have different stellar population properties, the more massive nuclei are older than ∼ 2 Gyr and have metal-poor stellar populations (Z ≤ 0.02 Z⊙), while the less massive nuclei are younger than ∼ 2 Gyr with metallicities in the range 0.02 < Z/Z⊙ ≤ 1.
    * A likely mixture of in-situ star formation and star-cluster mergers seem to be acting during nucleus growth over cosmic time.


#### [Structural properties of faint low surface brightness galaxies](https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.00499)
    - **Relevant** 
    * Our decomposition reveals that about 60% of these galaxies are bulgeless i.e., their light distributions are well modelled by pure exponential disks 剩下的是B+D的结构
    * According to g − r colour criteria, most of the LSB galaxies in our sample are blue, with only 7 classified as red LSBs. 这是GRB观测的LSB星系
    * 15% of the LSB galaxies (including both blue and red) in our sample host stellar bars
    * 这是按LSB和HSB分的，并不算真正的LSB星系


#### [Quantifying the AGN-driven outflows in ULIRGs (QUADROS) II: evidence for compact outflow regions from HST [OIII] imaging observations](https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.00514)
    * 外流的空间范围可以看AGN feedback是不是galaxy-wide的
    * 8个有AGN core的ULIRGS: the HST images show that the warm gas outflows are relatively compact for most of the objects in the sample: in three objects the outflow regions are barely resolved at the resolution of HST 


#### [On the Transition of the Galaxy Quenching Mode at 0.5<z<1 in CANDELS](https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.00595)
    - Liu Fei-Shan
    * On average both star-forming and transition galaxies at all masses are not fully quenched at any radii, whereas quiescent galaxies are fully quenched at all radii.
    * 用颜色梯度infer sSFR梯度：In other words, our findings support that internal processes dominate the quenching of massive galaxies, whereas external processes dominate the quenching of low-mass galaxies.

#### [Studying galaxy troughs and ridges using Weak Gravitational Lensing with the Kilo-Degree Survey](https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.00562)
    * We quantify their lensing strength A as a function of galaxy density percentile rank P and overdensity δ, and find that the skewness in the galaxy density distribution is reflected in the total mass distribution measured by weak lensing.
    * Using the MICE and SLICS mocks we predict that trough and ridge evolution could be detected with gravitational lensing using deeper and wider lensing surveys
    * Voids和trough可以用区分修正引力和LamdaCDM,

#### [Cloud-Scale Molecular Gas Properties in 15 Nearby Galaxies](https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.00937)
    - **Interesting; Sun Jia-Yi**
    * 45-120pc resolution, 30000 sightlines of ALMA 
    * Surface density and velocity dispersion show strong positive correlation; 基本符合resolved, self-gravitating clouds的预期
    * Observe enormous variation in the internal turbulent pressure
    * We find Σ, σ, and Pturb to be systematically larger in more massive galaxies. The same quantities appear enhanced in the central kpc of strongly barred galaxies relative to their disks.


#### [Can we improve CIV-based single epoch black hole mass estimations?](https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.00942)
    * Our results show that optical C IV-based mass estimates at high redshift cannot be a proper replacement for estimates based on IR spectroscopy of low ionization lines like Hα, Hβ and MgII.


#### [Momentum-driven Winds from Radiatively Efficient Black Hole Accretion and Their Impact on Galaxies](https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.00946)
    * 对比有AGN和no-AGN feedback的模拟
    * Our MrAGN model launches galactic outflows which result in both “ejective” feedback — the outflows themselves which drive gas out of galaxies — and “preventative” feedback, which suppresses the inflow of new and recycling gas.
    * The histories of NoAGN galaxies are recycling-dominated, with ∼ 70% of material that leaves the galaxy eventually returning, and the majority of outflowing gas re-accretes on 1 Gyr timescales without AGN feedback.


#### [Formation of ultra-compact dwarf galaxies from supergiant molecular clouds](https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.01071)
    - **Relevant**
    * We investigate the formation of UCD progenitor clusters from super giant molecular clouds (SGMCs)
    * 10^7-10^8 Msun的分子云，延展的恒星形成历史，多重星族，SFR依赖于AGB和SN.
    * 晚期形成的星族的分布会更compact，星团有多重结构


#### [Correlation between centre offsets and gas velocity dispersion of galaxy clusters in cosmological simulations](https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.01165)
    * The spatial offsets of gas centre from the halo centre could be an indicator of the dynamical state of cluster
    * Halos at higher redshifts tend to have larger values of rescaled offsets roff /r200 and larger gas velocity dispersion σgas/σ .
    * 提供了一个 r_off/r200和气体速度弥散度关系的函数形式


#### [Unbiased clustering estimates with the DESI fibre assignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.00951)
    * Clustering of samples constructed using a limited number of passes will be strongly affected by missing targets.
    * The effect of missing galaxies can be corrected when calculating the correlation function using a weighting scheme for pairs
    * On BAO scales, we find that the error is a factor 2 worse after one pass, but that after three or more passes, the errors are very similar.


#### [Statistical separation of weak gravitational lensing and intrinsic ellipticities based on galaxy colour information](https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.01240)
    * find linear combinations of measured ellipticity correlation functions which suppress the gravitational lensing signal completely or which show a strongly boosted gravitational lensing signal relative to intrinsic alignments.
    * Assumptions: 1) the large-scale structure follows Gaussian statistics on large scales, 2) intrinsic shapes of elliptical galaxies follows the linear tidal shearing model, 3) intrinsic shapes of spiral galaxies follows the quadratic tidal torquing model
