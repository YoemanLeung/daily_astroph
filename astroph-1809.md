#### [Can Stellar Discs in a Cosmological Setting Avoid Forming Strong Bars?](https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.00090)
    * We simulate a suite of isolated galaxy models that have the same Toomre Q parameter and swing amplification parameter but that differ in the vertical scale height and velocity dispersion.
    * The onset of bar formation occurs more slowly in models with thicker discs.
    * 在暗物质晕里加入disc: bar formation is driven by the stochastic effects of a triaxial halo and subhalo-disc interactions and the initial growth of bars appears to be relatively insensitive to the thickness of the disc.
    * thin discs in cosmological halos do appear to be more susceptible to buckling than thick ones and therefore bar strength correlates with disc thickness as in the isolated case.


#### [Dust attenuation and Halpha emission in a sample of galaxies observed with Herschel at 0.6<z<1.6](https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.00161)
    * We have used a new version of the CIGALE code to fit simultaneously the continuum and Hα line emission of the 34 selected galaxies: 0.6 <z < 1.6; 3D-HST
    * The attenuation of young stars or nebular continuum is found on average about twice the attenuation affecting older stars, again with a large variation. 
    * Our model with power-laws, based on a modification of the Charlot and Fall recipe, gives results in better agreement with the radiative transfer models than the global modification of the slope of the Calzetti law.


#### [A unique distant submillimeter galaxy with an X-ray-obscured radio-luminous active galactic nucleus](https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.00318)
    * Multiwavelength study of an atypical submillimeter galaxy, GH500.30, in the GOODS-North field
    * With the new NOEMA interferometric imaging, we confirm that the source is a unique dusty galaxy. It has no obvious counterpart in the optical and even NIR image
    * An X-ray spectral analysis suggests that this galaxy harbors a heavily obscured AGN 


#### [ELUCID. VI: Cosmic variance of galaxy distribution in the local Universe](https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.00523)
    * 用ELUCID模拟做的SDSS Volume上的星系empirical model catalog
    * The GSMF estimated from the SDSS magnitude-limited sample can be affected significantly by the presence of the under-dense region at z < 0.03, so that the low-mass end of the function can be underestimated significantly.
    * We propose a method based on the conditional stellar mass functions in dark matter halos, which can provide an unbiased estimate of the global GSMF.


#### [HELP: modelling the spectral energy distributions of Herschel detected galaxies in the ELAIS N1 field](https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.00529)
    * We perform SED fitting on the ultraviolet(UV)/near-infrared(NIR) to far-infrared(FIR) emission of 42 047 galaxies from the pilot HELP field: ELAIS N1. To do this we use the latest release of CIGALE
    * We found 351 possible candidates of lensed galaxies using two complementary χ2s criteria (stellar and infrared χ2s) and photometric redshifts calculated for the IR part of the spectrum only.


#### [Mapping the Kinematically Decoupled Core in NGC 1407 with MUSE](https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.00614)
    - **Relevant**
    * we explore the properties of the KDC using observations from the MUSE Integral Field Spectrograph to map out the kinematics in the central arcminute of NGC 1407.
    * Velocity and kinemetry maps of the galaxy reveal a twist of ∼148° in the central 10 arcseconds of the galaxy, and the higher-order moments of the kinematics reveal that within the same region,
    * Analysis of the stellar populations across the galaxy found no evidence of younger stellar populations in the region of the KDC, instead finding uniform age and super-solar α-enhancement across the galaxy, and a smoothly decreasing metallicity gradient with radius.


#### [On the relationship between metallicity distributions of globular clusters and of circumgalactic gas](https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.00621)
    * we discuss a possibility to consider dense clouds of circumgalactic gas (partial Lyman limit systems and Lyman limit systems) observed in the 100 – 130 kpc neighbourhood of galaxies at redshifts of 0.1 < z < 1.1 as being the residual parts of clouds, in which globular clusters (GC) have been formed.


#### [The XXL survey XXXV. The role of cluster mass in AGN activity](https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.00683)
    * Study of the AGN density in a homogeneous and well-studied sample of 167 bona fide X-ray galaxy clusters (0.1 < z < 0.5) from the XXL Survey, from the cluster core to the outskirts (up to 6r500).
    * We detect a significant excess of X-ray AGNs, at the 95% confidence level, in low-mass clusters between 0.5r500 and 2r500, which drops to the field value within the cluster cores (r < 0.5r500). 大多数是低光度AGN
    * In contrast, high-mass clusters present a decreasing AGN fraction towards the cluster centres, in agreement with previous studies.
    * It can be explained by a higher galaxy merging rate in low-mass clusters, where velocity dispersions are not high enough to prevent galaxy interactions and merging.


#### [Early- and late-stage mergers among main sequence and starburst galaxies at 0.2≤z≤2](https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.00715)
    - **Interesting**
    * Investigate the fraction of close pairs and morphologically identified mergers on and above the star-forming main sequence (MS) at 0.2 ≤ z ≤2.0. 
    * use of a non-parametric morphological classification performed on re- solved stellar mass maps, reducing the contamination by non-interacting, high-redshift clumpy galaxies.
    * We find that the merger fraction rapidly rises to ≥70% above the MS, implying that – already at z 1 – starburst (SB) events (∆MS ≥ 0.6) are almost always associated with a major merger
    * The observed variation of the late-stage merger fraction with ∆MS follows the perturbative 2-SFM model, where any MS galaxy can experience a continuum of different SFR en- hancements.


#### [Morphologies of ~190,000 Galaxies at z=0-10 Revealed with HST Legacy Data. III. Continuum Profile and Size Evolution of Lya Emitters](https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.00765)
    * We present the redshift evolution of the radial surface brightness (SB) profile of the rest-frame UV and optical stellar continua for 9119 Lyα emitters (LAEs) at z ≃ 0 − 8 and 0 − 2
    * We find that the effective radius re distribution is represented by a log-normal function, and that the median Śersic index is almost constant at n ≃ 1 − 1.5 for the LAEs over z ≃ 0 − 7
    * The median re values of the LAEs significantly evolve as re ∝ (1 + z)^−1.37, similar to those of the SFGs and LBGs in the same luminosity range


#### [On the multiplicity of ALMA Compact Array counterparts of far-infrared bright quasars](https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.00856)
    * ALMA Atacama Compact Array (ACA) 870 μm continuum maps of 28 infrared-bright SDSS quasars with Herschel/SPIRE detections at redshifts 2 – 4
    * Only a 30 per cent of the sample show clear evidence for multiple sources with secondary counterparts contributing to the total 870 μm flux within the SPIRE beam by at least 25 per cent.
    * For a large fraction of FIR-bright quasars, the sub-mm emission comes from single sources. Our results suggest that, on average, optically bright quasars with strong FIR emission are not triggered by early-stage mergers but are instead, together with their associated star formation rates, the outcome of either late-stage mergers or secular processes.


#### [Impact of galactic shear and stellar feedback on star formation](https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.01037)
    * We first confirm that the feedback has a strong limiting effect on star formation. The galactic shear has also a great influence: the higher the shear, the lower the SFR


#### [Dissecting cold gas in a high-redshift galaxy using a lensed background quasar](https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.01053)
    * We present a study of cold gas absorption from a damped Lyman-α absorber (DLA) at redshift zabs = 1.946 towards two lensed images of the quasar J144254.78+405535.5 at redshift zqso = 2.590.
    * 有两个LOS，距离是d=0.7 kpc
    * Based on the ratio of observed column density and volumetric density, we infer the average individual ‘cloud’ size along the line of sight to be l ≈ 0.1 pc.
    * Nonetheless, the projected covering fraction of cold gas must be large (close to unity) over scales of a few kpc in order to explain the presence of cold gas in both lines of sight.


#### [Late-time UV observations of tidal disruption flares reveal unobscured, compact accretion disks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.00003)
    * We present Hubble Space Telescope far-UV (FUV) observations of eight optical/UV selected TDFs 5-10 years post-peak. Six sources are cleanly detected, showing point-like FUV emission
    * 低质量黑洞的TDF光变曲线在晚期变平缓，Conversely, FUV light curves from high-mass black hole TDFs are generally consistent with an extrapolation from the early- time light curve.
    * The observed late-time emission cannot be explained by existing models for early- time TDF light curves (i.e. reprocessing or circularization shocks), but is instead consistent with a viscously spreading, unobscured accretion disk.
    * The disk models that explain the late-time UV detections solve the TDF “missing energy problem” by radiating a rest-mass energy of ∼ 0.1M⊙ over a period of decades, primarily in extreme UV wavelengths.


#### [A long decay of X-ray flux and spectral evolution in the supersoft active galactic nucleus GSN 069](https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.00319)
    * GSN 069 is an optically identified very low-mass AGN which shows supersoft X-ray emission. 有巨大的X-ray outbursts
    * Combining with the historical X-ray measurements, we find that the X-ray flux is decreasing slowly. There seemed to be spectral softening associated with the drop of X-ray flux.
    * The long decay of X-ray flux and spectral evolution, as well as the supersoft X-ray spectra, suggest that the source could be a tidal disruption event, though a highly variable AGN cannot be fully ruled out.
