#### [Can Stellar Discs in a Cosmological Setting Avoid Forming Strong Bars?](https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.00090)
    * We simulate a suite of isolated galaxy models that have the same Toomre Q parameter and swing amplification parameter but that differ in the vertical scale height and velocity dispersion.
    * The onset of bar formation occurs more slowly in models with thicker discs.
    * 在暗物质晕里加入disc: bar formation is driven by the stochastic effects of a triaxial halo and subhalo-disc interactions and the initial growth of bars appears to be relatively insensitive to the thickness of the disc.
    * thin discs in cosmological halos do appear to be more susceptible to buckling than thick ones and therefore bar strength correlates with disc thickness as in the isolated case.


#### [Dust attenuation and Halpha emission in a sample of galaxies observed with Herschel at 0.6<z<1.6](https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.00161)
    * We have used a new version of the CIGALE code to fit simultaneously the continuum and Hα line emission of the 34 selected galaxies: 0.6 <z < 1.6; 3D-HST
    * The attenuation of young stars or nebular continuum is found on average about twice the attenuation affecting older stars, again with a large variation.
    * Our model with power-laws, based on a modification of the Charlot and Fall recipe, gives results in better agreement with the radiative transfer models than the global modification of the slope of the Calzetti law.


#### [A unique distant submillimeter galaxy with an X-ray-obscured radio-luminous active galactic nucleus](https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.00318)
    * Multiwavelength study of an atypical submillimeter galaxy, GH500.30, in the GOODS-North field
    * With the new NOEMA interferometric imaging, we confirm that the source is a unique dusty galaxy. It has no obvious counterpart in the optical and even NIR image
    * An X-ray spectral analysis suggests that this galaxy harbors a heavily obscured AGN


#### [ELUCID. VI: Cosmic variance of galaxy distribution in the local Universe](https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.00523)
    * 用ELUCID模拟做的SDSS Volume上的星系empirical model catalog
    * The GSMF estimated from the SDSS magnitude-limited sample can be affected significantly by the presence of the under-dense region at z < 0.03, so that the low-mass end of the function can be underestimated significantly.
    * We propose a method based on the conditional stellar mass functions in dark matter halos, which can provide an unbiased estimate of the global GSMF.


#### [HELP: modelling the spectral energy distributions of Herschel detected galaxies in the ELAIS N1 field](https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.00529)
    * We perform SED fitting on the ultraviolet(UV)/near-infrared(NIR) to far-infrared(FIR) emission of 42 047 galaxies from the pilot HELP field: ELAIS N1. To do this we use the latest release of CIGALE
    * We found 351 possible candidates of lensed galaxies using two complementary χ2s criteria (stellar and infrared χ2s) and photometric redshifts calculated for the IR part of the spectrum only.


#### [Mapping the Kinematically Decoupled Core in NGC 1407 with MUSE](https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.00614)
    - **Relevant**
    * we explore the properties of the KDC using observations from the MUSE Integral Field Spectrograph to map out the kinematics in the central arcminute of NGC 1407.
    * Velocity and kinemetry maps of the galaxy reveal a twist of ∼148° in the central 10 arcseconds of the galaxy, and the higher-order moments of the kinematics reveal that within the same region,
    * Analysis of the stellar populations across the galaxy found no evidence of younger stellar populations in the region of the KDC, instead finding uniform age and super-solar α-enhancement across the galaxy, and a smoothly decreasing metallicity gradient with radius.


#### [On the relationship between metallicity distributions of globular clusters and of circumgalactic gas](https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.00621)
    * we discuss a possibility to consider dense clouds of circumgalactic gas (partial Lyman limit systems and Lyman limit systems) observed in the 100 – 130 kpc neighbourhood of galaxies at redshifts of 0.1 < z < 1.1 as being the residual parts of clouds, in which globular clusters (GC) have been formed.


#### [The XXL survey XXXV. The role of cluster mass in AGN activity](https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.00683)
    * Study of the AGN density in a homogeneous and well-studied sample of 167 bona fide X-ray galaxy clusters (0.1 < z < 0.5) from the XXL Survey, from the cluster core to the outskirts (up to 6r500).
    * We detect a significant excess of X-ray AGNs, at the 95% confidence level, in low-mass clusters between 0.5r500 and 2r500, which drops to the field value within the cluster cores (r < 0.5r500). 大多数是低光度AGN
    * In contrast, high-mass clusters present a decreasing AGN fraction towards the cluster centres, in agreement with previous studies.
    * It can be explained by a higher galaxy merging rate in low-mass clusters, where velocity dispersions are not high enough to prevent galaxy interactions and merging.


#### [Early- and late-stage mergers among main sequence and starburst galaxies at 0.2≤z≤2](https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.00715)
    - **Interesting**
    * Investigate the fraction of close pairs and morphologically identified mergers on and above the star-forming main sequence (MS) at 0.2 ≤ z ≤2.0.
    * use of a non-parametric morphological classification performed on re- solved stellar mass maps, reducing the contamination by non-interacting, high-redshift clumpy galaxies.
    * We find that the merger fraction rapidly rises to ≥70% above the MS, implying that – already at z 1 – starburst (SB) events (∆MS ≥ 0.6) are almost always associated with a major merger
    * The observed variation of the late-stage merger fraction with ∆MS follows the perturbative 2-SFM model, where any MS galaxy can experience a continuum of different SFR en- hancements.


#### [Morphologies of ~190,000 Galaxies at z=0-10 Revealed with HST Legacy Data. III. Continuum Profile and Size Evolution of Lya Emitters](https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.00765)
    * We present the redshift evolution of the radial surface brightness (SB) profile of the rest-frame UV and optical stellar continua for 9119 Lyα emitters (LAEs) at z ≃ 0 − 8 and 0 − 2
    * We find that the effective radius re distribution is represented by a log-normal function, and that the median Śersic index is almost constant at n ≃ 1 − 1.5 for the LAEs over z ≃ 0 − 7
    * The median re values of the LAEs significantly evolve as re ∝ (1 + z)^−1.37, similar to those of the SFGs and LBGs in the same luminosity range


#### [On the multiplicity of ALMA Compact Array counterparts of far-infrared bright quasars](https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.00856)
    * ALMA Atacama Compact Array (ACA) 870 μm continuum maps of 28 infrared-bright SDSS quasars with Herschel/SPIRE detections at redshifts 2 – 4
    * Only a 30 per cent of the sample show clear evidence for multiple sources with secondary counterparts contributing to the total 870 μm flux within the SPIRE beam by at least 25 per cent.
    * For a large fraction of FIR-bright quasars, the sub-mm emission comes from single sources. Our results suggest that, on average, optically bright quasars with strong FIR emission are not triggered by early-stage mergers but are instead, together with their associated star formation rates, the outcome of either late-stage mergers or secular processes.


#### [Impact of galactic shear and stellar feedback on star formation](https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.01037)
    * We first confirm that the feedback has a strong limiting effect on star formation. The galactic shear has also a great influence: the higher the shear, the lower the SFR


#### [Dissecting cold gas in a high-redshift galaxy using a lensed background quasar](https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.01053)
    * We present a study of cold gas absorption from a damped Lyman-α absorber (DLA) at redshift zabs = 1.946 towards two lensed images of the quasar J144254.78+405535.5 at redshift zqso = 2.590.
    * 有两个LOS，距离是d=0.7 kpc
    * Based on the ratio of observed column density and volumetric density, we infer the average individual ‘cloud’ size along the line of sight to be l ≈ 0.1 pc.
    * Nonetheless, the projected covering fraction of cold gas must be large (close to unity) over scales of a few kpc in order to explain the presence of cold gas in both lines of sight.


#### [Late-time UV observations of tidal disruption flares reveal unobscured, compact accretion disks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.00003)
    * We present Hubble Space Telescope far-UV (FUV) observations of eight optical/UV selected TDFs 5-10 years post-peak. Six sources are cleanly detected, showing point-like FUV emission
    * 低质量黑洞的TDF光变曲线在晚期变平缓，Conversely, FUV light curves from high-mass black hole TDFs are generally consistent with an extrapolation from the early- time light curve.
    * The observed late-time emission cannot be explained by existing models for early- time TDF light curves (i.e. reprocessing or circularization shocks), but is instead consistent with a viscously spreading, unobscured accretion disk.
    * The disk models that explain the late-time UV detections solve the TDF “missing energy problem” by radiating a rest-mass energy of ∼ 0.1M⊙ over a period of decades, primarily in extreme UV wavelengths.


#### [A long decay of X-ray flux and spectral evolution in the supersoft active galactic nucleus GSN 069](https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.00319)
    * GSN 069 is an optically identified very low-mass AGN which shows supersoft X-ray emission. 有巨大的X-ray outbursts
    * Combining with the historical X-ray measurements, we find that the X-ray flux is decreasing slowly. There seemed to be spectral softening associated with the drop of X-ray flux.
    * The long decay of X-ray flux and spectral evolution, as well as the supersoft X-ray spectra, suggest that the source could be a tidal disruption event, though a highly variable AGN cannot be fully ruled out.

## Sep 5:

#### [A Complete Spectroscopic Census of Abell 2029: A Tale of Three Histories](https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.01137)
    - **Relevant**
    * The fractions of AGN and post-starburst E+A galaxies in A2029 are similar to those of other clusters.
    * A2029 members within 10^9M⊙ < M∗ < 10^9.5M⊙ are more metal rich than SDSS galaxies within the same mass range.
    * The Dn4000 − M∗ relations of the members in A2029 and its two infalling groups differ significantly indicating the importance of stochastic effects for understanding the evolution of cluster galaxy populations.


#### [MUSE Spectroscopic Identifications of Ultra-Faint Emission Line Galaxies with MUV∼ -15](https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.01142)
    * Using an ultra-deep blind survey with the MUSE integral field spectrograph on the ESO Very Large Telescope, we obtain spectroscopic redshifts to a depth never explored before: galaxies with observed magnitudes mAB ~ 30 – 32.
    * we detect 102 objects via Lyman-α emission at 2.9 < z < 6.7 without individual continuum counterparts
    * A simple model for the expected fraction of detected/undetected Lyman-α emitters as a function of luminosity is consistent with these objects being the high-equivalent width tail of the normal Lyman-α-emitter population at these redshifts.


#### [Evidence for Ultra-Diffuse Galaxy `Formation' Through Galaxy Interactions](https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.01145)
    - **Relevant, Interesting**
    * We report the discovery of two ultra-diffuse galaxies (UDGs) which show clear evidence for association with tidal material and interaction with a larger galaxy halo,
    * The two new UDGs, NGC2708-Dw1 and NGC5631-Dw1, are faint (Mg=−13.7 and −11.8 mag), extended (rh=2.60 and 2.15 kpc) and have low central surface brightness (μ(g, 0)=24.9 and 27.3 mag arcsec−2)
    * These observations provide evidence that the origin of some UDGs may connect to galaxy interactions, either by transforming normal dwarf galaxies by expanding them, or because UDGs can collapse out of tidal material


#### [The origin of the mass scales for maximal star formation efficiency and quenching: the critical role of Supernova](https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.01154)
    * SAM研究：why the halo and stellar mass scales above which galaxies are quenched are constant with redshift and coincide with the scale where baryons are most efficiently converted into stars
    * SN Feedback很重要：As haloes grow above a threshold mass, SNe can no longer eject material so their hot gas content increases, enhancing the cooling rate onto the central galaxy, its cold gas content, its star formation rate and the growth rate of its central black hole


#### [Spatially Resoved 12CO(2-1)/12CO(1-0) in the Starburst Galaxy NGC 253: Assessing Optical Depth to Constrain the Molecular Mass Outflow Rate](https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.01160)
    * r21: CO(2–1)/CO(1–0) can be used to constrain the optical depth of the CO emission, which impacts the inferred mass of the outflow and consequently the molecular mass outflow rate.
    * We find r21<1 throughout, consistent with a majority of the CO emission being optically-thick in the outflow, as it is in the starburst. This suggests that the molecular outflow mass is 3−6 times larger than the lower limit reported for optically thin CO emission from warm molecular gas.


#### [Physics of a clumpy lensed galaxy at z=1.6](https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.01162)
    * An analysis of the clumpy galaxy A68-HLS115 at z = 1.5858, located behind the cluster Abell 68, but strongly lensed by a cluster galaxy member.
    * We obtain a stability of υrot/σ0 = 2.73 by modeling the kinematics, which means that the galaxy is dominated by rotation, but this ratio also indicates that the disk is marginally stable.
    * The direct measure of the Toomre stability criterion of Qcrit = 0.70 could also indicate the presence of a quasi-stable thick disk.
    * Three clumps contribute together to ∼ 40% on the SFRHα of the galaxy and show a star formation rate density about ∼ 100 times higher than HII regions in the local Universe.


#### [The Hydra I cluster core - II. Kinematic complexity in a rising velocity dispersion profile around the cD galaxy NGC 3311](https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.01163)
    - **Relevant**
    * Beyond inner 10 kpc, both the velocities and the velocity dispersion start to depend on azimuth angle and show a significant intrinsic scatter.
    * Outside 10 kpc the cumulative angular momentum is rising, however, without showing an ordered rotation signal.
    * If the radial dependence alone is considered, the velocity dispersion does not simply rise but fills an increasingly large range of dispersion values with two well defined envelopes.
    * The rising velocity dispersion of NGC 3311 apparently is a result of averaging over a range of velocity dispersions related to different tracer populations in the sense of different density profiles and anisotropies


#### [Metal Mixing and Ejection in Dwarf Galaxies is Dependent on Nucleosynthetic Source](https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.01167)
    - **Interesting**
    * 高分辨率的dwarf模拟中：we investigate how each of 15 metal species are distributed within our multi-phase interstellar medium (ISM) and ejected from our galaxy by galactic winds.
    * We demonstrate that the mass fraction probability distribution functions (PDFs) of individual metal species in the ISM are well described by a piecewise log-normal and power-law distribution
    * The log-normal component generally describes gas at lower metal fractions undergoing enrichment towards the mean metal fraction, driven by recent enrichment events in the power-law tail.
    * Hot gas is dominated by recent enrichment, with a significant power-law tail to high metal fractions, while cold gas is dominated by the log-normal component.
    * Elements dominated by asymptotic giant branch (AGB) wind enrichment, such as N and Ba, mix less efficiently than elements dominated by supernova enrichment
    * Nearly all of the produced metals are ejected from the galaxy (only 4% are retained), but metals dominated by AGB enrichment are retained at a fraction of 20%.


#### [The Causes of the Red Sequence, the Blue Cloud, the Green Valley and the Green Mountain](https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.01171)
    - **Important, Interesting**
    * We show that the galaxies found in a submillimetre survey have almost the opposite distribution in this diagram, forming a ‘green mountain’.
    * We show that these distinctive distributions follow naturally from a single, continuous, curved Galaxy Sequence in a diagram of specific star-formation rate versus stellar mass without there being the need for a separate star-forming galaxy Main Sequence and region of passive galaxies.
    * The cause of the red sequence and the blue cloud is the geometric mapping between stellar mass/specific star-formation rate and absolute magnitude/colour
    * The cause of the green mountain is Malmquist bias in the submillimetre waveband, with submillimetre surveys tending to select galaxies on the curve of the Galaxy Sequence, which have the highest ratios of submillimetre-to-optical luminosity.


#### [The Observational Signatures of Supermassive Black Hole Seeds](https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.01171)
    * It is a challenge to uniquely disentangle signatures of seeding from fueling and dynamics that shapes the assembly history of growing black holes. SAM研究
    * The behaviour of the low-mass end of the M• − σ relation is dominated by uncertainties in the adopted accretion prescriptions and does not offer clear dis- crimination between seeding models.


#### [MAGNUM survey: A MUSE-Chandra resolved view on ionized outflows and photoionization in the Seyfert galaxy NGC 1365](https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.01206)
    * The [Oiii] emission mostly traces a kpc-scale biconical outflow ionized by the AGN having velocities up to ∼200 km s−1. Hα emission traces instead star formation in a circumnuclear ring and along the bar
    * Soft X-rays are predominantly due to thermal emission from the star-forming regions, but we manage to isolate the AGN photoionized component which nicely matches the [O iii] emission.
    * The hard X-ray emission from the circumnuclear ring suggests that star formation might in principle contribute to the outflow


#### [Fast and slow paths to quiescence: ages and sizes of 400 quiescent galaxies from the LEGA-C survey](https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.01211)
    - **Relevant, Important**
    * We analyze stellar age indicators (Dn4000 and EW(Hδ)) and sizes of 467 quiescent galaxies with M∗ ≥ 10^10M⊙ at z ∼ 0.7 drawn from DR2 of the LEGA-C survey.
    * We find that the median stellar population is younger for larger galaxies at fixed stellar mass.
    * At the same time, quiescent galaxies with the strongest Hδ absorption — those experienced recent and rapid quenching events — tend to be smaller than the average.
    * The large scatter in Dn4000 and EW(Hδ) immediately implies that galaxies follow a large variety in evolutionary pathways.


#### [Fossil group origins IX. Probing the formation of fossil galaxy groups with stellar population gradients of their central galaxies](https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.01251)
    - **Relevant**
    * We present long-slit spectroscopic observations along the major, minor, and diagonal axes of NGC 6482 and NGC 7556, which are the BCGs of two nearby FGs
    * They host a centrally concentrated stellar population, which is significantly younger and more metal rich than the rest of the galaxy.
    * The age gradients of both galaxies are somewhat larger than those of the other FG BCGs studied so far, whereas their metallicity gradients are similarly negative and shallow. Moreover, they have negligible gradients of α-element abundance ratio.


#### [Dense Molecular Filaments Feeding a Starburst: ALMA Maps of CO(3-2) in Henize 2-10](https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.01339)
    * The warm dense gas traced by CO(3–2) is found in clumpy filaments that are kinematically and spatially distinct.
    * Filament没有明显指向性，星系可能不能演化为一个盘星系：Filaments appear to be feeding the active starburst; the velocity field in one filament suggests acceleration onto an embedded star cluster.
    * The kinematics of the molecular gas show significant activity apparently unrelated to the current starburst.


#### [Constraints On Duty Cycles Of Quasars At Z ∼ 6](https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.01545)
    - **Huanqing Chen**
    * 在z~6: constrain the fraction of dark matter halos hosting an active quasar fon and the quasar beaming angle imax using observations of CII lines in the literature
    *


#### [Modeling baryonic physics in future weak lensing surveys](https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.01146)
    - **Relevant, Important**
    * Here we explore the performance of two mitigation schemes for baryonic effects in weak lensing cosmic shear: the PCA method and the halo-model approach in HMcode.
    * With an angular scale cut of lmax < 2000, both methods successfully remove the biases in cosmological parameters due to the various baryonic physics scenarios, with the PCA method causing less degradation in the parameter constraints than HMcode.
    * We investigate variants of the PCA method and improve the bias mitigation through PCA by accounting for the noise properties in the data via Cholesky decomposition of the covariance matrix

#### [H0LiCOW - IX. Cosmographic analysis of the doubly imaged quasar SDSS 1206+4332 and a new measurement of the Hubble constant](https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.01274)
    - **Important**
    * The precision of our cosmographic measurement with the doubly imaged quasar SDSS 1206+4332 is comparable with those of quadruply imaged quasars and opens the path to perform on selected doubles the same analysis as anticipated for quads.
    * By combining the likelihoods of the four systems under the same prior, we obtain H0 = 72.5+2.1 km s−1 Mpc−1. This measurement is independent of the distance ladder and −2.3 other cosmological probes.

## Sep 6:

#### [The complete census of molecular hydrogen in a simulated disc galaxy](https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.01657)
    * RAMSES-RT模拟银河系类型的星系：A significant fraction of the H2 gas is in low-density regions mixed with atomic hydrogen and would therefore be difficult to observe.
    * Three resolutions of the same galaxy detail the effects it has on H2 formation, with grid cells sized 97, 24, and 6.1 pc. Only the highest resolution yields gas densities high enough to host significant H2 fractions, and resolution is therefore key to simulating H2.


#### [Dust emission in an accretion-rate-limited sample of z>6 quasars](https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.01662)
    * 1 mm observations of the rest-frame far-infrared (FIR) dust continuum in 27 quasars at redshifts 6.0 < z < 6.7.
    * 大部分都有探测，FIR光度在0.27-13 x 10^12 Lsun; 尘埃质量在 10^7-10^9 Msun.
    * However, combined with results from the literature to create a luminosity–limited quasar sample, we do not find a strong correlation between quasar UV luminosity (a proxy for ongoing black hole growth) and FIR luminosity (star-formation in the host galaxy)


#### [IQ-Collaboratory 1.1: the Star-Forming Sequence of Simulated Central Galaxies](https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.01665)
    * We present a flexible data-driven approach for identifying this SFS over a wide range of star formation rates and stellar masses using Gaussian mixture modeling (GMM).
    * Surprisingly, the amplitude of the SFS varies by up to ∼0.7 dex (factor of ∼5) among the simulations with power-law slopes range from 0.7 to 1.2.
    * All of the simulations also produce an abundance of low-mass quiescent central galaxies in apparent tension with observations.


#### [Fast Molecular Outflow from a Dusty Star-Forming Galaxy in the Early Universe](https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.01676)
    * We report a molecular outflow launched from a dust-rich star-forming galaxy at redshift 5.3, one billion years after the Big Bang.
    * The outflow reaches velocities up to 800 km s−1 relative to the galaxy, is resolved into multiple clumps, and carries mass at a rate within a factor of two of the star formation rate.
    * molecular outflows can remove a large fraction of the gas available for star formation from galaxies at high redshift.

#### [On the origin of gas-poor galaxies in galaxy clusters using cosmological hydrodynamic simulations](https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.01684)
    - **Relevant**
    * 模拟研究 satellite gas depletion: The gas depletion mechanisms can be categorized into three channels based on where and when they took place.
    * First, 34% of our galaxies are gas poor before entering clusters (“pre-processing”). They are mainly satellites that have undergone the environmental effect inside group halos.
    * Second, 43% of the sample became quickly gas deficient in clusters before the first pericentric pass (“fast cluster processing”). 其中很多都是已经在group里损失了气体的
    * Third, 24% of our sample retain gas even after their first pericentric pass (“slow cluster processing”) as they fall into the less massive clusters and/or have circular orbits.
    * Group pre-processing accounts for a third of the total gas depletion; but it also determines the gas fraction of galaxies at their cluster entry which in turn determines whether a galaxy should take the fast or the slow cluster processing.


#### [The nature of the variable millimetre-selected AGN in the Brightest Cluster Galaxy of Abell 851](https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.01700)
    * NOEMA: the detection of a bright 3 mm continuum source in the Brightest Cluster Galaxy (BCG) in Abell 0851 (z = 0.411)
    * We find evidence for a relatively flat, variable core source associated with the BCG.
    * The radio power and amplitude of variability observed in this galaxy is consistent with the cores in lower redshift BCGs in X-ray–selected clusters, and the flat mm–cm spectrum is suggestive of the BCG being a low luminosity AGN archetype. 和regulatory feedback有联系 ?


#### [The Cluster-EAGLE project: a comparison of dynamical mass estimators using simulated clusters](https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.01704)
    - **Relevant, Important**
    * We compare three different dynamical mass estimators using the C-EAGLE galaxy clusters, a set of high resolution simulations with resolved galaxies
    * 用M*>10^9 Msun的星系测量Jeans，Virial，和Caustic动力学质量，在3-D和投影空间
    * On average we find our mass estimates are unbiased, though relative to the true mass within r200c the scatter is large with a range of 0.09 - 0.15 dex. 投影空间的scatter略大
    * Comparing X-ray derived hydrostatic and dynamical masses, the former are ∼30 per cent lower.


#### [Identifying Direct Collapse Black Hole Seeds through their Small Host Galaxies](https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.01754)
    * We utilize a cosmological N-body simulation to demonstrate that before they grow roughly an order of magnitude in mass, DCBHs will have black hole mass to halo mass ratios much higher than expected for black hole remnants of Population III (Pop III) stars which have grown to the same mass


#### [Probing the fluctuating Ultra-violet background using the Hubble Frontier Fields](https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.01798)
    * constraining the fluctuating UV background during reionization by constraining α in different volumes of the Universe.

    * CNN training: Training results are strongly bound to the conversion method from raw FITS data for each band into a 3-channel color image.
    * The detection and classification methods were trained using the deep learning framework DARKNET and the real-time object detection system YOLO.

#### [The Recent Growth History of the Fornax Cluster Derived from Simultaneous Sloshing and Gas Stripping: Simulating the Infall of NGC 1404](https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.02134)
    * 模拟显示：exclude a first infall scenario of NGC 1404
    * NGC 1404 passed by NGC 1399 about 1.1 - 1.3 Gyrs ago from the NE to the SW and is now almost at the point of its next encounter from the S.
    * This scenario explains the sloshing patterns observed in Fornax - a prominent northern cold front and an inner southern cold front.

#### [Automated Distant Galaxy Merger Classifications from Space Telescope Images using the Illustris Simulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.02136)
    - **Interesting**
    * 用Illustris模拟图像研究并合：Using the merger tree, we assess methods to observationally select simulated mergers with stellar mass ratios as low as 10:1 completing within 250 Myr before or after the time-step of the mock observation.
    * 类似CAS之类的图像方法误差很大，作者用Random Forest训练
    * We then apply these classifiers to CANDELS HST survey data, estimating a merger rate increasing to at least z = 3 and with improved statistical errors, albeit a factor of two higher than expected by theory.


#### [The Role of Black Hole Feedback on Size and Structural Evolution in Massive Galaxies](https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.02143)
    - **Relevant, Important**
    * We find that AGN feedback can alter the stellar density distribution, reduce the core density within the central 1 kpc by 0.3 dex from z = 1, and enhance the size growth of massive galaxies.
    * AGN feedback plays an important role in transforming galaxies from blue compact galaxies into red extended galaxies in two ways:
        - (1) it effectively quenches the star formation, transforming blue compact galaxies into compact quiescent galaxies and
        - (2) it also removes and prevents new accretion of cold gas, shutting down in-situ star formation and causing subsequent mergers to be gas-poor or mixed.
    * AGN feedback also puffs up the central region through the fast AGN driven winds as well as the slow expulsion of gas while the black hole is quiescent


#### [Chemical Abundances in the Ultra-Faint Dwarf Galaxies Grus I and Triangulum II: Neutron-Capture Elements as a Defining Feature of the Faintest Dwarfs](https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.02182)
    * We verify previous results that Tri II displays significant spreads in metallicity and [α/Fe]. Neutron-capture elements are not detected in our Tri II data, but we place upper limits at the lower envelope of Galactic halo stars
    * 球状星团中的中子捕获元素丰度和Halo star类似；而UDF中很多恒星都缺乏中子捕获元素，说明极低的恒星形成效率的Halo中的元素增丰过程不同
    * The nucleosynthetic origin of this low neutron-capture element floor remains unknown.
        - 中子捕获元素： e.g. Sr, Ba, Eu
        - Some UFDs (Reticulum II and Tucana III) have extremely high abundances of neutron- capture elements synthesized in the r-process (Ji et al. 2016a; Roederer et al. 2016; Hansen et al. 2017).


#### [Massive BH Binaries as Periodically-Variable AGN](https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.02138)
    * we calculate the expected electromagnetic detection rates of MBH binaries as periodically variable AGN.
    * 考虑了: (i) Doppler boosting due to large orbital velocities, and (ii) hydrodynamic variability in which the fueling of MBH accretion disks is periodically modulated by the companion.
    * Our models predict that numerous MBH binaries should be present and distinguishable in the existing data: 20 and 100 are expected after five years of LSST observations.


#### [The first tidal disruption flare in ZTF: from photometric selection to multi-wavelength characterization](https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.02608)
    * The ZTF light curve of the TDE samples the rise-to-peak exceptionally well, with 50 days of g and r-band detections before the time of maximum light.
    * 有X-ray detection和Radio上限：The X-ray emission shows a thermal spectrum (kT ≈ 100 eV) and is two orders of magnitude fainter than the contemporaneous optical/UV blackbody luminosity.
        - The observed blackbody radii of known TDEs (Gezari et al. 2009) suggest the soft X-ray photons of these flares originate from the inner part of a newly-formed accretion disk; 光学光子产生的半径要大得多
        * 光学和X-ray辐射多样：optical emission is powered by shocks from intersecting stellar debris streams (Piran et al. 2015) and the X-ray photons are produced when parts of the stream get deflected towards a few gravitational radii and accreted (Shiokawa et al. 2015; Krolik et al. 2016)

    * A superdense star-forming region with an effective radius (Re) smaller than 13 pc identified at z=6.143 and showing a star-formation rate density of 1000 Msun/yr/kpc^2.
    * D1 is magnified by a factor 17.4(±5.0) behind the Hubble Frontier Field galaxy cluster MACS J0416 and elongated tangentially by a factor 13.2 ± 4.0 (including the systematic errors).
    * This compact system fits into some popular globular cluster formation scenarios.


#### [GASP. XII. The variety of physical processes occurring in a single galaxy group in formation](https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.02668)
    * We present the study of four galaxies that are part of the same group (z = 0.06359) and highlight the multitude of mechanisms affecting the spatially resolved properties of the group members.
    * Ram pressure stripping in group? :  Finally, the fourth galaxy is a spiral with a truncated ionised gas disk and an undisturbed stellar kinematics. An analytical model of the galaxy’s restoring pressure, and its location and velocity within the cluster, suggest ram pressure is the most likely physical mechanism in action.


#### [YZiCS: Preprocessing of dark halos in the hydrodynamic zoom-in simulation of clusters](https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.02763)
    - **Relevant**
    * YZiCS, a hydrodynamic high-resolution zoom-in simulation of 15 clusters
    * We find ∼ 48% of today’s cluster members were once satellites of other hosts.
    * the preprocessed fraction is poorly correlated with cluster mass and is instead related to each cluster’s recent mass growth rate. 比Group要小的host halo的贡献也很多, 1/3
    * visibly disturbed cluster members are more likely to have experienced preprocessing. Being hosted before cluster infall enables cluster members to experience tidal stripping for extended durations compared to direct cluster infall and at earlier epochs when hosts were more destructive.

#### [Polar Dust, Nuclear Obscuration and IR SED Diversity in Type-1 AGNs](https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.03080)
    - **吕建伟**
    * we develop semi-empirical SED libraries for reddened type-1 AGNs built on the quasar intrinsic templates, assuming low-level extinction caused by an extended distribution of large dust grains.
    * we compile 64 low-z Seyfert-1 nuclei with negligible mid-IR star formation contamination and satisfactorily fit the individual IR SEDs as well as the composite UV to mid-IR composite SEDs.
    * The SEDs of high-z peculiar AGNs, including the extremely red quasars, mid-IR warm-excess AGNs, and hot dust-obscured galaxies, can be also reproduced by our model.
    * The IR SEDs of most AGNs, regardless of redshift or luminosity, arise from similar circumnuclear torus properties but differ mainly due to the optical depths of extended obscuring dust components.


#### [Distance, Energy, and Variability of Quasar Outflows: Two HST/COS epochs of LBQS 1206+1052](https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.03114)
    * These data cover, for the first time, absorption troughs from S iv, Si ii, and P v. 可以估计高速外流的电子密度

#### [Bivariate luminosity-HI mass distribution function of galaxies based on the NIBLES survey](https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.03155)
    * Optical luminosity-Hi mass bivariate luminosity function (BLF) based on Hi line observations from the Nançay Interstellar Baryons Legacy Extragalactic Survey (NIBLES).
    * Spanning the entire luminosity range of NIBLES, we identify a highly consistent distribution of the Hi gas mass to luminosity ratio (gas-to-light ratio) with a predictable progression in the mean MHI/Lr ratio as a function of Lr.


#### [Detection of large scale Lyα absorbers at large angles to the radio axis of high-redshift radio galaxies using SOAR](https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.03340)
    * 在Off radio axis的方向上研究高红移射电星系周围的吸收气体：Spatially extended Lyα emission is detected with large line widths (FWHM = 1000 – 2500 km s−1), which although impacted by resonant scattering, is suggestive of turbulent motion
    * We find a correlation between higher blueshifts and higher FWHM, which is an indication that radial motion dominates the bulk gas dynamics perpendicular to the radio axis
    * Extended, blueshifted Lyα absorption is detected in the direction perpendicular to the radio axis in three radio galaxies with minimum spatial extents ranging from ∼> 27 kpc to ∼> 35 kpc, supporting the idea that the absorbing structure covers the entire Lyα halo, consistent with being part of a giant, expanding shell of gas enveloping the galaxy and its (detected) gaseous halo.


#### [The WIRCam Ultra Deep Survey (WUDS) I. Survey overview and UV luminosity functions at z~5 and z~6](https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.03373)
    * WUDS includes four near-IR bands (Y, J, H and Ks) over a field of view of ∼400 arcmin2. The typical depth of WUDS data reaches between ∼26.8 in Y and J, and ∼26 in H and Ks (AB, 3σ in 1.3′′aperture),
    * Our results on the luminosity function are consistent with a small evolution of both M⋆ and Φ⋆ between z=5 and z=6, irrespective of the method used to derive them, either photometric redshifts applied to blindly-selected dropout sample
    * WUDS is intended to provide a robust database in the near-IR for the selection of targets for detailed spectroscopic studies, in particular for the EMIR/GTC GOYA Survey.


#### [The turbulent pressure support in galaxy clusters revisited](https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.02690)
    * 模拟：Itasca Simulated Cluster sample； 利用AMR code ENZO
    * While the ubiquitous presence of radial inflows in the cluster can lead to significant bias in the estimate of the non-thermal pressure support, we report that only a part of this energy effectively acts as a source of pressure, providing a support of the order of ∼ 10% of the total pressure at R200.
        - The Hitomi satellite managed to detect root- mean square velocities in the (fairly relaxed) Perseus cluster of ∼ 200 km/s on ~60 kpc (e.g. Hitomi Collaboration et al. 2016; ZuHone et al. 2018).


#### [A New X-ray Selected Sample of Very Extended Galaxy Groups from the ROSAT All-Sky Survey](https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.02982)
    - **Interesting**
    * We aim to determine if a hypothetical class of very extended, low surface brightness, galaxy groups or clusters have been missed in previous X-ray cluster surveys based on the ROSAT All-Sky Survey (RASS).
    * We found many known but also a number of new group candidates, which are not included in any previous X-ray or SZ cluster catalogs: 13 groups exhibit flatter surface brightness distributions than usual.

#### [The Cosmic Microwave Background and the Stellar Initial Mass Function](https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.03502)
    - **Interesting**
    * We argue that an increased temperature in star-forming clouds alters the stellar initial mass function to be more bottom-light than in the Milky Way. At redshifts z 􏰅 6, heating from the cosmic microwave background radiation produces this effect in all galaxies
    * A failure to account for it means that at present, photometric template fitting likely overestimates stellar masses and star formation rates for the highest-redshift and highest-SFR galaxies.


#### [Resolving CO (2-1) in z~1.6 Gas-Rich Cluster Galaxies with ALMA: Rotating Molecular Gas Disks with Possible Signatures of Gas Stripping](https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.03514)

    * SpARCS-J0225: Mapping out the kinematic structure and morphology of the molecular gas on ∼3.5 kiloparsec scales reveals rotating gas disks in the majority of the galaxies, as evidenced by smooth velocity gradients.
    * We find that the cluster galaxies, while broadly consistent with a ratio of unity for stellar-to-gas effective radii, have a moderately larger ratio compared to the coeval field; this is consistent with the more pronounced trend in the low- redshift Universe. 团星系里的气体盘更truncated ?


#### [Observational signatures of massive black hole formation in the early universe](https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.03526)
    * We study a simulation of a nascent massive, so-called direct-collapse, black hole that induces a wave of nearby massive metal-free star formation, unique to this seeding scenario and to very high redshifts.
    * We find a series of distinct colors and emission line strengths, dependent on the relative strength of star formation and black hole accretion 可以用JWST观测
    * We also find that a massive seed black hole produces strong, H2-dissociating Lyman-Werner radiation.
    * 用ENZO做的数值模拟; we stage a radiative transfer post-processing analysis using the CAIUS pipeline

    * MUSE观测：ESO 338-IG04 has a large ionized halo which we detect to a distance of 9 kpc. We identify 4 Wolf-Rayet (WR) clusters based on the blue and red WR bump.
    * Analysis of the galaxy kinematics shows two complex outflows driven by the numerous young clusters in the galaxy


#### [Testing strong line metallicity diagnostics at z~2](https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.0612)
    * We test commonly used strong line diagnostics (R23, O3, O2, O32, N2, O3N2 and Ne3O2) as prescribed by four different sets of empirical calibrations, as well as one fully theoretical calibration, on high-z SF galaxies whose gas-phase metallicity can be determined using auroral lines.
    * Amongst the line ratios tested, R23 and O3 deliver the best results, with accuracies as good as 0.01-0.04 dex and dispersions of ∼0.2 dex in two of the calibrations tested.

    * We analyse their X-ray spectra using the MYTORUS models of Murphy and Yaqoob which properly take into account the Compton scattering effects.
    * Furthermore, we find that the majority of our AGN lacks a strong reflection component in the 20-40 keV band placing tighter constraints on the intrinsic Compton-thick AGN fraction. 近邻宇宙里CT-AGN占Type-II AGN的20%左右


#### [Chemodynamics of dwarf galaxies under ram-pressure](https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.03760)
    * 看ram pressure and tidal forces如何影响dwarf星系内的金属丰度分布
    * We find that while ram pressure and tidal forces have some effect on dwarf galaxy outflows, these effects do not produce large differences in the metal distributions of the dwarf disks other than truncation in the outer regions in some cases


#### [The uneven sisters I, NGC 4388 - a strongly constrained ram pressure stripping event](https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.03805)
    * We made dynamical simulations of the ram pressure stripping event to investigate the influence of galactic structure on the observed properties of NGC 4388.
    * The observed asymmetries in the disk of NGC 4388 are not caused by the present action of ram pressure, but by the resettling of gas that has been pushed out of the galactic disk during the ram pressure stripping event


#### [The dependence of intrinsic alignment of galaxies on wavelength using KiDS and GAMA](https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.03602)
    - **Interesting**
    * To quantify this, we measured the shapes of galaxies with spectroscopic redshifts from the GAMA survey using deep gri imaging data from the KiloDegree Survey. The performance of the moment-based shape measurement algorithm DEIMOS was assessed using dedicated image simulations
    * We measure a significant difference of the alignment signal between the g, r and i-band observations. This difference exceeds the amplitude of the linear alignment model on scales below 2 Mpc/h. Separating the sample into central/satellite and red/blue galaxies, we find that that the difference is dominated by red satellite galaxies.

    * We find that the stellar and gas-phase abundances are very similar, which supports internal production and is very inconsistent with the accretion of smaller, lower metallicity dwarfs.
    * The emission line flux ratios along the long- slit, as well as global line ratios clearly indicate that photoionization dominates and ionization by alternate sources including AGN activity, shocks, cosmic rays, dissipative magnetohydrodynamic waves, and single degenerate Type Ia supernovae progenitors do not significantly affect the line ratios.
